The covered topics include the research advances on estuarine dynamics , wave climate, and coastline evolution in the region. This review aims to offer an updated baseline on the topics and sites that have been more explored by coastal scientists and those who need more efforts in short- to mid-term. The extensive analysis of peer-reviewed literature carried out here shows that river mouths are the most studied coastal systems in the region, together with the coastal sectors near the largest cities. On the contrary, national parks and pristine areas with high environmental value are barely studied. Finally, a vision from the author’s perspective on important physical-coastal and transdisciplinary issues to be addressed in the upcoming years is presented. ]"

A critical review ],"[ Highlights Seabirds contribute to inter-habitat connectivity at global scale. Seabird influence on coastal systems is overlooked compared to terrestrial systems. Seabirds greatly influence ecological processes and functioning of recipient systems. Seabird functions influence the provision of many ecosystem services. More studies are needed to improve the knowledge in this field. , Seabirds are vital, but overlooked, components of coastal marine ecosystems and may connect the marine and terrestrial environment at a global scale, significantly contributing to inter-habitat connectivity and the provision of multiple ecosystem services. Although the ecological and functional role of birds in terrestrial areas , islands in particular, has been deeply studied since the last century, the same does not hold true for coastal marine areas. Given the importance of coastal areas for seabirds worldwide and, at the same time, the high vulnerability of both, looking into the role of seabirds in influencing the ecosystem functioning in coastal areas is needed nowadays. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding the role of seabirds on coastal ecological processes giving particular emphasis on the linkage between the seabird functions that are crucial in influencing the ecological processes and the provision of ecosystem services, and disservices, for the human well-being. Seabirds can contribute to shaping coastal ecological processes and services in a multitude of ways, among which directly influencing trophic status , environmental contamination, biodiversity and food webs through trophic (bottom-up or top-down) and non-trophic processes. We identified areas for future research to further clarify this linkage and promote seabird conservation. ]"

Various indicators are used to express potential storm impact and describe the associated hazards. The most commonly used indicators include either forcing parameters (e.g. wave height, sea level) or coastal morphologies (e.g. dune height or berm width). Whereas they do not represent the processes associated with storm induced hazards in coastal areas. Alternatively, a hazard could be better characterised if process-based indicators are used instead. Process-based indicators express the result of the forcing mechanisms acting over the coastal morphology and reflect both hydrodynamic and morphological characteristics. This work discusses and synthesizes the most relevant process-based indicators for sandy shores subject to overwash , erosion and inundation promoted by storms. Those include: overwash depth, potential and extent; shoreline , berm or dune retreat; vertical erosion; and inundation depth and extent. The selection of a reduced set of process-based indicators to identify coastal hazards induced by storms in sandy coasts will facilitate comparison of different coastal behaviours for distinct storm return periods, and help to optimise coastal management plans, thereby contributing to the reduction of coastal risks. ]"

Its diversified area supports high variability of socio–economics activities leading to serious conflicts in terms of coastal space and resources competition in an intensive human occupation context. This paper describes the past and present processes of coastal planning in Brazil and its mechanism towards the establishment of a costal management mode, capable to assure the desired sustainable development of the coast. It explains the policy trajectory of coastal Brazil and the way in which it is intended to be integrated into the national socio-political system. The National Policy for Sea Resources (PNRM) was a significant advance in organizing the multiple uses of the coastal and marine zones of Brazil. Established in the 1980s, the PNRM has been reviewed bi-annually through new proposed action plans. The Brazilian Costal Management Plan is analyzed trying to highlight the role of coastal municipalities in the planning and management processes. The role of local communities and municipalities in building public policies and management processes is still weak in Brazil and possibly can be enhanced with a better evaluation model and increasing local participation. ]"

Coastal plains such as the one in the southern part of Samborombón Bay have a tidal morphology consisting of fine sediment deposits, tidal channels, and aeolian sand sheets, each of them playing a hydrological role. In this paper, we describe the hydrological processes in the Samborombón Bay coastal plain using hydrochemical and isotopical data to provide evidence of salinization processes. Specific ionic relationships for surface and ground water samples from each formation are differ from those of sea water. Isotopic data also reveal infrequent participation of sea water in the coastal area water samples, showing an evaporation trend in both surface and ground water. We conclude that salinization has its origin in the occurrence of gypsum and halite, as well as other chlorides, from the coastal plain deposits. Rainfall recharge, continental water inputs, evaporation and long residence times define the hydrochemical and isotopical features of ground water, which shows no signs of present sea water contribution. Sand sheets constitute local aquifers with lower salinity content. Continental surface waters, as well as rainfall drainage via tidal channels, have a dominant effect on surface water hydrochemistry notwithstanding tidal oscillations. Exploitation of water resources is thus limited to regionally extended aeolian sand sheet formations and to surface waters, specifically those related to contributions of freshwater discharge from inland areas. ]"

This designation was first applied to shore-parallel sand and gravel-built ocean-front islands and spits that separate open marine environments from paralic inshore environments that they shelter. A more recently recognized third category includes mainland strandplain, chenier, and dunefield barriers, either as original components of mainland coasts or subsequently welded to the coastal plain. A parallel but closely related terminology, developed mostly in Australia and Brazil, identifies several specific process categories recognizable in the three basic barrier groups. In the absence of lagoons and tidal wetlands, shore ridges that front and are contiguous with the mainland coastal plain have been mistakenly assigned to the barrier island category. Greatly diminished wave energy and consequently minor littoral drift volumes account for the relative rarity and much smaller dimensions of prograded landforms in estuarine islands and bay shore beaches in paralic-inshore basins. Due to wave and related littoral drift processes, however diminished in comparison with open marine shores, morphological similarities between aggraded landforms of open marine through estuarine settings are to be expected. However, the multitude of proposed “fetch-limited”, diminished wave energy estuarine islands, characterized by diminutive narrow beaches, sand spits, even occasional small dunes, and miniature strandplains, lack the essential functional attributes intrinsic to true barrier islands. While barrier islands may form even on relatively low wave energy and/or sediment-deficient marine shores, the term is inappropriate for islands located in low-energy paralic basins, including estuaries, or in coastal plains where frontal shore ridges are not backed by lagoons. Landforms erroneously ascribed in a variety of facies settings as barrier islands or islands frequently are mainland-attached beach ridge plains or beach-fringed marshlands instead. Narrow marshland beaches and mainland strandplain barriers are segmented into short islands by intervening narrow tidal creeks, fluvial distributary channels, or storm cuts that separate them. Improved fundamental and functional definitions of barrier islands, their comparison with the many genetic categories of islands and mainland shore beaches found in estuarine basins and wetlands should lead to a better understanding of paralic island evolution processes on the global scale. ]"

OPEs concentrations in the coastal environment are much higher than open ocean. OPEs exist in various environmental media including air, seawater, and sediment. The bioaccumulation of OPEs has been observed in coastal biota. OPEs can be distributed remotely through atmospheric and ocean transports. , The rapid growth in the global production of organophosphate esters (OPEs) has resulted in their high environmental concentrations. The low removal rate of OPEs makes the effluents of wastewater treatment plants be one of the major sources of OPEs. Due to relatively high solubility and mobility, OPEs can be carried to the coastal environment through river discharge and atmospheric deposition . Therefore, the coastal environment can be an important OPE sink. Previous studies have shown that OPEs were widely detected in coastal atmospheres, water, sediments, and even aquatic organisms. OPEs can undergo various environmental processes in the coastal environment, including adsorption/desorption, air–water exchange, and degradation. In addition, bioaccumulation of OPEs was observed in coastal biota but current concentrations would not cause significant ecological risks. More efforts are required to understand the environmental behaviors of OPEs and address resultant environmental and health risks, especially in the complicated environment. ]"

The semi-enclosed Adriatic Sea represents a natural long-standing laboratory for model development. A set of examples that can be used as guidelines for different model applications. A look and a prospect for the corresponding possible future developments. , Understanding the water circulation in oceans and coastal seas is among the key topics of oceanographic and climate research. Hydrodynamic studies form the basis for many oceanographic subjects, whether sediment transport , morphology, water quality, ecological and climate changes are being investigated. Hydrodynamic modelling of oceans and coastal seas has become a fundamental tool for describing the dynamics of marine environments, revealing the human impact on the sea and promoting sustainable development of marine resources. By complementing – through data assimilation – more and more diffuse and integrated global and regional observing systems (composed of coastal gauges, moorings, buoys, satellites, drifters), hydrodynamic models provide a deterministic 4D view of the ocean state. In this context, the semi-enclosed Adriatic Sea represents a natural long-standing laboratory for hydrodynamic modelling. The peculiar historical, morphological and oceanographic characteristics of this basin and its complex coastline stimulated over decades the development and application of several ocean and coastal models. In this work, we review different aspects of hydrodynamic modelling covered by the literature, highlighting the wide variety of model applications carried out in the Adriatic Sea which could serve as examples for semi-enclosed, marginal and coastal seas worldwide. Within the scope of the review, we find that although significant progress has been made over the last few decades, most of the modelling studies underrate the importance of a detailed representation of the land-coastal-sea fluxes. We list a set of recommendations that can be used as guidelines for model implementation to broaden the applicability of hydrodynamic models in future studies. Finally, we discuss the remaining questions that still need to be further explored. ]"

Key differences include patterns of river input fluxes, nitrogen cycling processes, and organic nutrient cycling. Therefore, models developed in temperate zones are not always transferable to the tropics. , Tropical coastal waters are highly dynamic and amongst the most biogeochemically active zones in the ocean. This review compares nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles in temperate and tropical coastal waters. We review the literature to identify major similarities and differences between these two regions, specifically with regards to the impact of environmental factors (temperature, sunlight), riverine inputs, groundwater, lateral fluxes, atmospheric deposition , nitrogen fixation , organic nutrient cycling, primary production, respiration, sedimentary burial, denitrification and anammox. Overall, there are some similarities but also key differences in nutrient cycling, with differences relating mainly to temperature, sunlight, and precipitation amounts and patterns. We conclude that due to the differences in biogeochemical processes, we cannot directly apply cause and effect relationships and models from temperate systems in tropical coastal waters. Our review also highlights the considerable gaps in knowledge of the biogeochemical processes of tropical coastal waters compared with temperate systems. Given the ecological and societal importance of tropical coastal waters, we hope that highlighting the differences and similarities to temperate systems as well as the existing gaps, will inspire further studies on their biogeochemical processes. Such knowledge will be essential to better understand and forecast impacts on tropical coastal nutrient cycling at local, regional, and global scales. ]"

The Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) is favoured in coastal hazard studies, as it provides a predictive approach to coastal changes through its simple numerical basis in classifying coastlines based on their potential to change. The recent widespread use of innovative technologies has contributed to accessible coastal components to investigate coastal hazards and analyse risk assessment. However, most of the studies related to CVI have rarely exploited these forms of technology despite being utilised in various geodetic applications. Hence, a comprehensive review is performed to evaluate the application of these technological advances, particularly on exploiting space geodetic technology to determine and classify coastal information from various analytical approaches. This paper systematised modern approaches utilizing space technology to form CVI to assess the significant processes affecting the vulnerability and evolution of coastal areas. It is envisaged that the exploitation of space technology will facilitate CVI development and promote effective coastal management strategies. ]"

In the Great Lakes Region , resilience is gaining increasing attention from planners and policy makers in response to more frequent disruptions to social-ecological systems and built environments from coastal hazards. There has not yet been extensive research into how resilience is being defined in practice and how these definitions can affect geographies of risk and resilience and contribute to varying ecological, social, cultural, political, and economic outcomes. In this paper, we analyzed how stakeholders engaged in natural resource management activities within the Laurentian Great Lakes coastal environment define resilience and discuss the implications for planning and policy making through a critical geography and critical space lens. We systematically reviewed gray literature published by these stakeholders to document definitions of resilience. We then applied a 5Ws + H of resilience framework—resilience for whom, what, where, when, why, and how—to develop descriptive statistics and qualitatively analyze the definitions, considering the potential implications for ongoing regional planning and policy making efforts. Our analysis revealed a large degree of variation in the definitions, although we note two distinct gaps. We discuss how these gaps could affect ongoing regional planning and policy making efforts, and we lay out four research needs to inform planning and policy making going forward. ]"

The Río de La Plata is the major export of suspended sediment in the region. The SSCare influenced by the ENSO cycles. The river discharge from Patos Lagoon and íde la Plata and Río de La Plata interact with the SSC on a seasonal up to interannual time scale of variability. The wind contribution on the SSC behaviour gains importance on the inner shelfon a synoptic time scale. , Global coastal zones are constantly changing due to the actions of various physical forces. Recent studies show that the supply of suspended sediment of continental origin plays an important role in these changes. Once in the coastal region, this sediment significantly influences the sedimentation process on the inner shelf. Thus, understanding the transport and destination of these suspended sediments is crucial to interpret the morphodynamic evolution of the seabed and biogeochemical processes in the ocean. The Southwest Atlantic Shelf is the largest continental shelf in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the most important in biological production, because of the great continental contribution exercised by both Río de la Plata and Patos Lagoon . Studies in the region showed that these effluents are significantly affected by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect, which can interfere with the availability of suspended material inserted into the coastal region. Despite the great efforts of several authors to understand these changes and their interactions with the environment, some questions remain unanswered. Thus, this work aims to fill this gap by answering questions related to the contribution of suspended sediment of continental origin and its behaviour on the Southwest Atlantic Inner Shelf. The behaviour of suspended sediment was investigated in two distinct periods using the hydro-morphodynamic model TELEMAC-3D: one representing normal years, that is, without the effect of ENSO (2005–2006) and the other experiencing the effect of ENSO (2008–2009).The model was calibrated and validated using field data for both studied periods. R esults were based on statistical analysis, such as wavelet and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, in addition to time series analysis. Results showed that the Southwest Atlantic Inner Shelf is mainly influenced by the fluvial discharge of Río de la Plata and Patos Lagoon, and by the local wind. Río de la Plata is the largest exporter of suspended sediment in the region, with an approximate rate of 1.2 × 10 8 tons.year -1 in neutral (normal) years and 3.0 × 10 8 tons.year -1 in years under the influence of ENSO. The Patos Lagoon, on the other hand, exports approximately 1.25 × 10 7 tons.year -1 in the period without the ENSO effect and 1.35 × 10 7 tons.year -1 in the period influenced by ENSO. Results also showed that the fluvial discharge interacts with the suspended sediment in seasonal to interannual scales, while the wind contributes to the concentration of suspended sediment on synoptic scales. Still on the wind regime, results show that the local wind regime gains importance particularly when the suspended sediment reaches the coastal region. ]"

The Weibull analysis supports the polymodal distributions in the Oaxaca's coastal dune sands. Dune morphology seems not to control the diversity in grain sizes of the coastal dune sands. , This study elucidates the geological and physical factors that produce polymodal grain size distributions in two dunes systems in southeastern Oaxaca, Mexico. The dune systems are characterized by (1) small embryo vegetated, transverse and undeveloped dunes; and (2) tall types identified as barchanoid, parabolic, climbing and falling dunes. We performed a best-fit statistical Weibull distribution model with data obtained by laser granulometry to determine the polymodal trends of the coastal dune sands distribution. Polymodal distributions in small dunes arise from coarse and fine-grained sands mainly derived from the erosion of alluvial deposits composed of granitic and metasedimentary rock fragments (e.g., schists , orthogneiss and paragneiss). The medium- to fine-grained sands result from wind deflation, producing a heavy mineral lag. Conversely, the polymodal grain size distributions in the tall dunes are mainly derived from the physical weathering of granites , andesitic-tuff-lava flow marine sandstones (ATLMS), alluvial deposits, and metasedimentary rock fragments (e.g., schists, orthogneiss and paragneiss) due to the frequent storms and intense winds. We constructed binary plots of grain size parameters to compare the dune sand systems in Oaxaca with some others in Mexico. Based on the sedimentary results and the Weibull distributions, we conclude that the grain sizes of the coastal dune sands from Oaxaca, Mexico, are controlled by the sand composition, wind patterns, hydrodynamic conditions, weathering effects, and physical characteristics, regardless of the dune geomorphology. Evidence of multicycle aeolian transport of sand particles in the Oaxaca coastal dunes is supported by the compositional framework of the sands and the roundness of sand grains. ]"

However, its applicability in aquatic remote sensing has not been sufficiently assessed. Some fundamental questions such as the following need to be addressed: How does the R_land product perform in global inland and coastal waters? What water color parameters can be mapped using R_land? This study provided a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of MODIS R_land products against a field optical dataset containing 4143 reflectance spectra, 2320 chlorophyll-a (Chl a ) samples, and 1467 suspended particulate matter (SPM) samples across global nearshore coastal and inland waters . The results showed that R_land significantly overestimated remote sensing reflectance, particularly in the bands of 469 nm and 859 nm. The noticeable negative values and patchiness were found in the R_land imagery, and existing algorithms did not estimate satisfactory Chl a and SPM from R_land across the global inland and coastal waters. Furthermore, we tested popular machine-learning approaches, such as random forest (RF), support vector machine , XGBoost, and deep neural networks, to examine the potential of the R_land product in estimating SPM and Chl a . Machine learning models were found to outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms for SPM retrievals from R_land. Specifically, RF and XGBoost showed the good performance with mean absolute errors of ~25.0% and mean absolute percentage error of ~23% for a broad SPM range of 10–500 mg L −1 . Yet, machine learning models cannot retrieve reliable Chl a from R_land with approximately 55% uncertainty due to the limited spectral information and uncertainty of R_land products. This implicated that R_land might be able to quantify the parameters that are closely related to SPM (e.g., water clarity and extinction coefficients) in most waters; however, it is challenging to quantify pigments like Chl a in waters from R_land. We conclude that R_land might not be an optimal data source for monitoring inland and coastal waters, despite the ease of using this product and its higher spatial resolution than the MODIS ocean bands. ]"

Coastal engineering works affect the hydro-sedimentary balance of the local system. Knowledge about impacts is the first step towards sustainability measures. , Coastal regions have important social and economic relevance and are vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts. Port settlement and development are among the main economic activities that take place in these zones and generally require the construction of coastal structures such as breakwaters, jetties, seawalls and bulkheads . Such interference can have severe consequences on the natural features of these systems, especially to inlets and adjacent coasts. The increasing levels of shipping traffic and anthropogenic impacts on the dynamics of coastal systems are of great importance for coastal sciences and highlight the requirement for sustainable coastal management. The first step towards sustainability measures is to get knowledge of the broad environmental impacts associated with interventions on coastline and morpho-sedimentary processes. In this study, environmental impacts that are associated with coastal engineering works worldwide were reviewed focusing on port development. The main anthropogenic impacts and guidelines for sustainable development in coastal zones are summarized and discussed in detail. ]"

Data from marine sediment archives allow improved constraints on future climate predictions. Knowledge gaps remain despite significant methodological advancements in recent decades. Calibration data and reconstructions from the Arctic coastal zone are needed. Interdisciplinary research and enhanced communication are vital for future research. , Frozen components on land and in the ocean (sea ice, ice sheets, glaciers and permafrost) form the cryosphere , which, together with the ocean, moderates the physical and chemical habitat for life in the Arctic and beyond. Changes in these components, as a response to rapidly warming climate in the Arctic, are intensely expressed in the coastal zone. These areas receive increased terrestrial runoff while subject to a changing sea-ice and ocean environment. Proxies derived from marine sediment archives provide long-term data that extend beyond instrumental measurements. They are therefore fundamental in disentangling human-driven versus natural processes, changes and responses. This paper (1) provides an overview of current Arctic cryosphere change, (2) reviews state-of-the-art palaeoecological approaches, (3) identifies methodological and knowledge gaps, and (4) discusses the strengths and future potential of palaeoecology and palaeoceanography to respond to societally-relevant coastal marine ecosystem challenges. We utilise responses to an open survey conducted by the Future Earth Past Global Changes (PAGES) working group Arctic Cryosphere Change and Coastal Marine Ecosystems (ACME). Significant research advancements have taken place in recent decades, including the increasingly common use of multi-proxy (multiple lines of evidence) studies, improved understanding of species-environment relationships, and development of novel proxies. Significant gaps remain, however, in the understanding of proxy sources and behaviour, the use of quantitative techniques, and the availability of reference data from coastal environments. We highlight the need for critical methodological refinement, interdisciplinary collaboration on research approaches, and enhanced communication across the scientific community. ]"

Terrigenous organic matter deposition and tidal sedimentation are main C sources. Very high productivity of blue C ecologies also results huge C burial. Low microbial oxidation, high clay % and soil aggregation cause C sequestration. Coastal C sink is degrading, collaborative efforts are proposed for its restoration. , The global extent of coasts is huge and it has a massive impact on the planetary C balance. Coasts are again very heterogeneous with their soils and sediments possessing varying C storing capacity. In this review, we tried to capture such capacity of soils and sediments of coastal natural ecologies (like estuary , mangrove , mudflat, tidal marsh, seagrass , lagoon , continental shelf etc.) and croplands collectively in a mechanistic way. A detail discussion highlights very high C accrual in coastal soils and sediments due to terrigenous C deposition, tidal sedimentation and presence of fine clay particles. Very high biomass of coastal mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass beds also results huge C burial in soils and sediments (blue C). Further, salinity and waterlogging induced low microbial activities , high soil aggregation and occlusion of C within aggregates impart prolonged residence time to C in coastal soils. All these confirm coastal ecology as a global C hotspot. However, climate change associated events like sea-level rise, ocean temperature increase, ocean acidification as well as human interferences have already affected the coasts and projected trend indicates severe possible damage of the coastal blue C in near future. Holistic sustainable measures will be required from different ends like government, local as well as international organizations to protect and restore the coastal C sink. ]"

While the region is one of the best studied marine systems in the world, a historical perspective that connects social-ecological dynamics of change across California's diverse cultural periods is lacking. Historical ecology offers a lens through which researchers and managers can use historical information to not only better understand the complex dynamics that have driven ecosystem change in the past, but also inform crucial decisions around conservation and sustainable management of these systems into the future. Here we synthesize historical estimates of population abundance of eleven key species and habitats across coastal California as a foundation for understanding the potential for decline, recovery, or reorganization inherent in these ecosystems. This millennia-scale historical perspective reveals that humans have played a significant role in shaping California's marine ecosystem dynamics for far longer than is traditionally accounted for in many restoration and management contexts. Each individual cultural period reviewed here paints an increasingly complex story of social-ecological interactions and impacts, with each time period intricately tied to the trajectory of the last. As we consider management actions in an increasingly unpredictable future, information around how these systems have historically responded to new and growing pressures may prove invaluable to their future sustainability . While historical baselines may not provide a realistic, or even desirable, model for future sustainability, they may offer important insights into the social-ecological potential for change and recovery moving forward. ]"

Relationships between avulsion-frequency proxies and associated spatial and temporal scales are assessed. Recommendations are made on how to compare the avulsion frequency of coastal-plain rivers. , Quantification of the frequency with which coastal-plain rivers avulse is important for elucidating autogenic dynamics and their role as controls on landscape change and stratigraphic architectures. An outstanding question exists, however, as to whether measures of avulsion frequency are inherently affected by the spatial and temporal scales at which they are evaluated, which has implications regarding our ability to make direct comparisons between different river systems or deltas. To address this problem, a quantitative analysis of the avulsion histories of 57 coastal-plain river systems is undertaken. Nine alternative measures of avulsion frequency are extracted. These are based on numbers of (i) avulsion events, (ii) active or abandoned channel courses, and (iii) delta lobes, all considered per unit time. Additional sets of avulsion-frequency proxies are established based on normalization of these numbers relative to the size of the area being studied, and to the number of distinct river systems that drain into that area. The sensitivity of these quantities to the spatial and temporal extent of study areas and time intervals, and their relationships with quantities describing the scale of the river systems, are assessed. All avulsion-frequency estimates demonstrate apparent negative relationships with the timespan over which they are determined; this may reflect global Holocene trends, or variations in resolution with the time window. Avulsion metrics that are not normalized by the planform extent of the study area do not show proportionality with the size of the study areas themselves, nor with the scale of the river systems; correspondingly, the spatio-temporal density of avulsion events tends to be higher for smaller rivers and associated study areas. This may be due to systematic variations in data resolution, to the influence of external controls that relate to the scale of deltas, or to inherent non-stationarity in the avulsion dynamics of lowland rivers, in association with forms of self-organization that do not vary with scale. Although non-normalized avulsion-frequency estimates do not scale with measures of river-system size, they are seen to correlate with progradation rates, which are themselves scaled to sediment discharge and catchment size. Practical considerations can be drawn on how avulsion frequency may be appropriately quantified to enable meaningful comparisons of the autogenic dynamics of coastal-plain rivers. ]"

The cycling of these iron (hydr-)oxides is closely coupled to that of organic C, which in turn strongly influences the magnitude and dynamics of organic C turnover in these ecosystems. This review synthesizes and summarizes current knowledge of distribution, turnover, and controls of Fe (hydr-)oxides, as well as their ecological roles and impacts on organic C turnover in coastal wetland ecosystems globally. Regional hydro-geochemical processes and anthropogenic activities in the uplands as well as soil texture exert a first-order control on the abundance and distribution of Fe (hydr-)oxides in coastal wetland soils , while the activities of plant roots and macro-organisms act as important biological drivers for the formation, transformation, and turnover of Fe (hydr-)oxides as well as associated organic C in both rhizosphere/burrows and bulk soils. The reported rates of dissimilatory Fe reduction (DFeR) are correlated with incubation temperature and the sizes of reactive Fe(III) phases. However, the contributions of DFeR to total anaerobic carbon oxidation were found to be correlated only with the size of reactive Fe(III) pools, meaning that all the identified processes contributing to the accumulation and formation of Fe hydroxides could increase the importance of the DFeR-dominated respiratory pathway and suppress sulfate reduction and methanogenesis . Additionally, Fe plaques dominated by amorphous Fe hydroxides are formed and cycled in close interaction with the activities of wetland plant roots, and likely provide several important ecological functions and contribute to maintaining high levels of plant productivity in coastal wetlands under different environmental stresses. The features and findings presented in this review not only contribute to an improved understanding of the biogeochemical cycle and ecological roles of Fe (hydr-)oxides in coastal wetlands, but also provide a basis for future studies on some highlighted key research areas. Such future studies will further increase our ability to understand and predict how the size, stability, and turnover of Fe (hydr-)oxides and organic C in coastal wetlands will respond to and affect global climate change. ]"

On this aspect, the present study details the spatio-temporal status of the alluvial and coastal plains of the Kandaleru river of Nellore district using Landsat , LISS III and Sentinel 2A satellite images for the years 1973, 1988 and 2020. The study utilized Remote Sensing (RS), Geographical Information System (GIS) and Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) capabilities to identify the morphological changes and their impacts. Interpretation of morphological features from temporal satellite images were carried out using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) technique of remote sensing and the impacts were studied using spatial analyst tools of ArcGIS and river bank dynamics was assessed and quantified using DSAS model. The study indicated a decrease in the spatial extent of both alluvial and coastal plains of the Kandaleru river during the study period. The alluvial plain decreased from 106.98 km 2 in 1973 to 64.34 km 2 in 2020 predominantly due to growth of aquaponds and other anthropogenic human interventions such as the growth of commercial and habitation areas. The coastal plain decreased by 13% during the study period due to the development of port and its related activities.

The wave-exposed Atlantic coast of Morocco south of Agadir is dominated by 5–10 m-high lithified aeolianite cliffs and shore platforms interrupted by mobile aeolian dunes in the vicinity of the mouths of two rivers (wadis), the Souss and the Massa, which are part of a RAMSAR site of significant biodiversity. We examined the multi-decadal geomorphic evolution of the Massa coastal sector and the main drivers of this evolution, based on an analysis of aerial photographs and satellite images from 1970 to 2020. We also monitored beach topography from January 2019 to July 2020 to determine short-term shoreline response to seasonal variations in wave conditions, and how this ties up with the longer time frame. The long-term pattern is essentially controlled by a balance, in the shoreline position, between the erosional cliff line, aeolian dune sand accumulation, and longshore sediment transport . The beaches show a seasonal regime that conforms to the classical cut in winter and accretion in summer. Sediment supply from the Massa has been curtailed by the Youssef Ben Tachfine dam constructed in 1972, but limited sand supplies from wave erosion of the aeolianite cliffs and reworking of the aeolian dunes assure overall shoreline stability. These sources are very likely complemented by carbonate sand from the wave-dominated shoreface. Periodic sand trapping and release occur within the Massa mouth, often sand-blocked but reopened during floods. The future sediment-budget equilibrium of the Massa littoral cell will depend on the continuity of these sources of sediment supply. The aeolianite cliffs and large aeolian dunes are significant sources of sediment that could mitigate, as along much of the Atlantic coast of Morocco, the expected shoreline retreat from sea-level rise. ]"

This paper reviews the current state of the art of methods used to model climate change-induced coastal erosion focusing on how climate change-related drivers and the associated uncertainty are considered. We identify research gaps, describe and analyse the key components of a comprehensive framework to derive future estimates of shoreline change and make suggestions for good practice. Within the scope of the review, we find that although significant progress has been made over the last decade, most of the studies limit uncertainty sampling to considering ranges of variation of forcing variables and ensembles of emissions scenarios, and applications with high level of probabilistic development remain few. Further research is necessary to fully (a) incorporate projected time series of coastal drivers into the erosion models, including bias correction; (b) sufficiently sample the uncertainty associated with each step of the top-down approach, including the consideration of different emission scenarios, inter- and intra-model variability, and multiple runs of erosion models or model ensembles; and (c) reduce uncertainty in shoreline change estimates by developing better datasets and model parameterisations, and progressing in detection and attribution. ]"

Inclusion of ILK can have ecological, political and socio-cultural benefits. Integration of ILK is challenged by external forces, and collaboration and government structures. Ridgid and purely natural science based research methods can challenge the integration of ILK. , Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) is increasingly recognized as a valuable asset in sustainability science. Knowledges of Indigenous peoples and local communities is becoming a critical tool for understanding coastal social-ecological systems and coping with global changes. The inclusion of ILK in research and management is key to local desirable social-ecological resilience and community-based conservation approaches, especially in areas with accelerated landscape changes. The Global South in particular is experiencing rapid changes through development and climate change, while harbouring many biodiversity hotspots. To synthesize the existing information and highlight still existing research gaps we conducted a systematic literature review on ILK from coastal ecosystems in the Global South ( n = 254). Our results show to which biophysical aspects and ecosystems the knowledge is related, as well as the challenges and benefits that accompany the inclusion of ILK for management and research. Main challenges named were based on external forces, such as globalisation and market pressure but also a lack of integration and respect in governance and management for ILK and the difficulty of integrating ILK in today's academic work. Many researchers showed ways to overcome such multi-scale challenges and highlighted the importance of this process due to the various benefits of ILK for management and research. All articles reviewed named benefits in ecological (e.g. complementary knowledge production), political (e.g. support of community-based governance) or socio-cultural (e.g. maintenance of culture and livelihoods) aspects for management and research. Maintaining ILK is crucial for Indigenous people and local communities and carries insights to govern coastal ecosystems during the challenging times ahead. We conclude that future research is needed to further develop the current position of ILK in research and management of ecosystems, especially as global environmental changes may contribute to the acceleration of losing ILK from coastal ecosystems in the Global South. ]"

The origin of these morphostructural units has been largely debated. They have been ascribed to different ages between the Cretaceous and the Pliocene , and tectonic causes that involve extensional or contractional deformation and have been related to Andean evolution or accretionary processes in the forearc. To investigate the geologic evolution of the Coastal Cordillera and Central Depression in the cited area, we based on stratigraphy, sedimentology , geochronology (U Pb, LA-ICP-MS), structural geology , and geomorphology. Our studies, which are based on our own data and a thorough bibliographic review, indicate the following sequence of events in the tectono-sedimentary evolution of the forearc of south-central Chile during the late Cenozoic. The area was subjected to extensional tectonics caused by slab rollback during the Oligocene-early Miocene , resulting in the genesis of a series of basins filled with volcanic, continental, and marine deposits that extended from the present Chilean coast to the retroac. The extensional basins were tectonically inverted during the late Early-Late Miocene , and most of the forearc became a positive relief that was subjected to fluvial erosion. The West Andean Thrust, a major reverse west verging fault in the limit between the Central Depression and the Andean Cordillera, caused significant uplift of the western flank of the Andes. This triggered flexural subsidence and the accumulation of coarse-grained deposits in the forearc during the Pliocene-Pleistocene. The sudden increase of sediment flux to the trench during this period caused a change from non-accretion or subduction erosion to accretion in the margin of south-central Chile. Progressive growth of the accretionary wedge gave birth to a forearc high, the Coastal Cordillera, which was uplifted in the last 2 Ma. Some forearc areas placed above subducted oceanic fracture zones did not experience uplift during this period due to the significant transport of fluid that inhibited the deformation of the accretionary wedge. Our studies show that the late Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the forearc in the study area is complex and involves different processes related to Andean evolution in the first stage and accretionary processes acting exclusively in the forearc in a second stage. The Coastal Cordillera and the Central Depression of south-central Chile were developed in the last 2 Ma and are much younger than classically considered. ]"

The spatial and temporal variability of Chl-a makes it difficult to monitor the coastal waters using in-situ data alone. This study aims to retrieve the Chl-a distribution in Yanam and Kakinada turbid coastal waters using Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) algorithms from Sentinel-3 OLCI and Sentinel-2 MSI data. The FLH products show moderate correlation with retrieved and in-situ Chl-a data, whereas the MCI products show exceptionally good correlation with both the data. Assessment results show a better correlation between in-situ and retrieved Chl-a derived from Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 satellite data (R 2 = 0.858; R 2 = 0.883). The final results show that the S2MCI product gives the best results compared to S3MCI to retrieve Chl-a in the study area. Analysis results demonstrate that FLH algorithm and models are limited to the coastal area with Chl-a &lt; 4 mg/m 3 , whereas MCI algorithm is recommended for Chl-a &gt; 4 mg/m 3 . The S2MCI algorithm shows better performance with root mean square error (RMSE = 0.76) and mean absolute relative error (MARE = 1.14) for Chlorophyll retrieval compared with other algorithms. The MCI algorithm is more effectively used to retrieve the Chl-a in the study area. Moreover, this study also demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-3 OLCI and Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data for better observation and retrieval of Chl-a distribution over the turbid coastal waters. ]"

The ensemble-average delta aggradation rate is ~1.6 ± 0.4 mm/y, if 70% of the global sediment load exits river mouths, can be compared to a growing sea level rise is ~4.0 ± 0.1 mm/y. Many Late Holocene deltas have moved from a growth phase to a sinking phase during the Anthropocene, a phenomenon preferentially impacting larger deltas. A mean 76 ± 16% drop in hydraulic energy occurs in all deltas regardless of size, and drives an ever-decreasing bed-material transport and a shallowing distributary channels, followed by overbank flooding. , Deltas are subaerial landforms that cap underlying deposits with subaqueous extensions that result from a river feeding sediment directly into a standing body of water at a rate that overwhelms any effective dispersal processes derived from the ambient basin. This definition encapsulates both the terrestrial surface expression and the geological focus on the entire sediment mass. Environmental studies also focus on the ecology of deltaic wetlands, their drowning history, and related sustainability issues including societal considerations, history, and culture. A mean 76 ± 16% drop in hydraulic energy occurs in all subaerial deltas regardless of size, given the break in gradients separating fluvial and deltaic surfaces, driving an ever-decreasing bed-material transport, shallowing of distributary channels and concomitant overbank flooding. A delta's sediment mass grows from the addition of new river loads but can also include aeolian and marine sediment derived from outside the delta domain, growth of peat and other biomass, and inputs from human action. Removal of sediment is via river plumes interacting with marine currents, wave-induced transport, sediment failures and gravity flows, high-tide inundation onto the delta plain, tidal channel widening and deepening, and human action (peat, clay, sand and gravel mining). A delta's trapping efficiency ranges from 0 for small-load rivers that discharge directly into an energetic ocean, to 80% for large deltas, and up to 100% for some semi-enclosed bayhead deltas, including fjords. The global (ensemble) subaerial delta aggradation rate is ~1.6 mm/y if 70% of the global sediment load exits the river mouth(s), a reminder of how much sediment can be expected to be delivered to the surfaces of global deltas at a time when the 2022 CE sea level rise is ~4 mm/y. At the planetary scale, deltas are environmentally complex given Earth's range in climate, hydrodynamics, tectonic settings, relative sea-level provinces, sediment input, redistribution processes, and human actions. Under natural conditions, the subaerial portion of deltas adapt to change by advancing, retreating, switching, aggrading, and/or drowning, whereas many modern deltas are structurally constrained by societal needs. The 89 large and mud-rich coastal marine deltas (i.e. subaerial area &gt; 1000 km 2 ) account for 84.3% of Earth's total deltaic area that hosts &gt;89% of all humans occupying deltas, many living within megacities. The 885 medium-size deltas (i.e. subaerial areas 10–1000 km 2 ) account for 15.5% of the global delta area and 10.5% of humans living on deltas, with characteristics that fall between the small and large delta categories. The 1460 small and essentially sandy deltas (1–10 km 2 ), including all fjord deltas, are impacted less from human action (with exceptions) and most are better able to withstand climate change. Recognizing the limits of big data in capturing delta complexity, field data remains a necessary gold standard for site investigators. ]"

An improved site-specific modulated transfer function is designed for nearshore wave analysis using video imagery, for a high energy coast. Issues from the impacts of sunlight on video imagery are significantly addressed during the pre-monsoon period. , Continuous collection of hydrodynamic data from the nearshore region by deploying marine instruments is challenging, mainly because of the huge cost and risk involved in keeping these sophisticated instruments in the highly dynamic nearshore region, since the area is often subjected to harsh environmental conditions. In such situations, adoption of remote sensing methods like use of land-based camera stations for continuous monitoring is advantageous due to its low risk and cost-effective features and ability to provide data during extreme events. In this connection, National Centre for Earth Science Studies (NCESS) has initiated a pilot project for continuous coastal monitoring, adopting the video-based monitoring method in India through an indigenous Video Beach Monitoring System (VBMS). The first VBMS station, comprising of four cameras have been installed at Valiathura, a typical high energy beach in SW coast of India and the software tools for deriving coastal morpho-hydro dynamic characteristics from video imagery are being developed. For estimation of wave characteristics, the use of linear transfer function methods has limitations in highly dynamic nearshore environments and the varying sunlight conditions during AN sessions along west coasts will also have serious impacts on the analysis. These difficulties can be addressed by adopting a modulated transfer function (MTF) approach. In this paper, an improved nearshore wave analysis from video timestacks, using MTF approach is discussed. The developed MTF uses multi-tapered spectral methods wherein the periodograms are averaged to reduce the effect of non-linearities as well as the variations due to sunlight in the spectral density.

Funding for coastal restoration should be expanded. , Coastal zones are defined as the areas where the land meets the sea. Although coast zones have significant resource and ecological value, they are ecologically vulnerable to human activities and natural disasters. In the past 70 years, the coastal wetlands of China have experienced ecological problems such as wetland degradation, coastal erosion , environmental pollution , and non-native species invasion caused by natural and man-made factors. China has taken a series of measures to control coastal degradation including coastline restoration, coastal wetland recovery, and coastal ecological corridor designation and development. These measures are reflected by longer areas of natural coastline, larger coastal wetland areas and stable numbers and diversity of species present in coastal ecosystems today. Although China’s coastal restoration efforts have borne fruit, outstanding challenges remain: (1) many coastal ecosystems have yet to be improved; (2) many restoration projects have only a short duration; (3) the acceptance standards for restoration projects are not comprehensive; (4) many restoration projects are operated on a small scale; (5) the source of restoration funds is often limited to a single channel; and (6) no strong theoretical or practical support is provided for most projects.

Accurately assessing multiple stressor effects is essential for predicting stressor impacts and informing management to efficiently and effectively mitigate potentially complex ecological responses. Extracting relevant information on multiple stressor studies conducted specifically within coastal wetlands is not possible from existing reviews, posing challenges in highlighting knowledge gaps and guiding future research. Here, we systematically review manipulative studies that assess multiple anthropogenic stressors within saltmarsh, mangrove , and seagrass ecosystems. In the past decade, there has been a rapid increase in publications, with seagrasses receiving the most attention (76 out of a total of 143 studies). Across all studies, nutrient loading and temperature were tested most often ( N = 64 and N = 48, respectively), while the most common stressor combination was temperature with salinity ( N = 12). Stressor application and study design varied across ecosystems. Studies are mostly conducted in highly controlled environments, without considering how natural variations in the physicochemical environment of coastal ecosystems may influence stressor intensity and timing under these conditions. This may result in vastly different ecological responses across levels of biological organisation. Shifting focus from univariate analytical approaches to multivariate, particularly path analysis, will help elucidate complex ecological relationships and highlight direct and indirect effects of multiple stressors in coastal ecosystems.

Physical characterization and visual identification of both MP and macroplastics were carried out. Methods from reviewed studies were irreconcilable without apportioning possible sources of MP and macroplastics. Plastic regulation policies were established not necessarily supported by researches on MP and macroplastic. An observable growing number of plastic regulation policies coincide with the increase on plastic research. , The Philippines was reported as one of the top plastic polluters (macroplastics and microplastics (MPs)) to the marine coastal environment, which necessitated the development and enforcement of plastic regulation policies. However, the nexus between the growing research on macroplastic/MP and the plastic regulation policies in the country is unexplored. Current review suggests that macroplastic/MP research in the Philippines is still in its infancy owing to methodological and technological constraints to apportion the sources and fluxes, characterize macroplastics/MPs, and identify influencing socio-environmental factors. While government efforts are underway, it is also unclear if local researches on macroplastics/MPs were the basis in institutionalizing the existing plastic regulation policies. Therefore the nexus between the researches carried out on this problem and the policies enforced cannot be concluded. Overall, this review presents gaps on the macroplastic/MP research needing more work on the problem to establish a sound science plastic regulation policy. ]"

Land-use data were taken into account to better define the role of anthropogenic impact. Multidisciplinary approach to understand the causes of subsidence in coastal plains , Many coastlines around the world are subsiding, often due to tectonic causes. In tectonically active areas, the exploitation of natural resources has caused acceleration of subsidence rates. In these cases, it is difficult to separate the many different components of the subsidence process. We try to fill this gap, using both remote sensing data and geological evidence, in an area located in southern Italy (Sele River plain) and characterized by the presence of both human activities and natural processes. The coastal sector of the Sele plain shows a complex subsidence pattern, as testified by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PS InSAR) data related to a period of about two decades (1992–2010), that we put in correlation with stratigraphical data from both outcrops and boreholes (ca. 250). The Quaternary infill of the coastal sectors of the plain is not laterally isotropic and homogeneous because of the presence of layers of clastic sediments with different degrees of compaction. Dunal and beach sands, back-ridge (lagoonal and palustrine) silty clays , palaeosols and thick peaty layers are the main facies of this sedimentary prism. The back-ridge depressions hosted palustrine and marshy environments and were artificially drained in the last centuries. The main output of the PS- InSAR analysis is a map of vertical ground deformation (VGD), which has been a useful tool to understand the causes of the subsidence process if combined with geological data from field and boreholes. In fact, the overlay of the SAR interferometry VGD map with the geomorphological and stratigraphical features shows that the subsidence is higher in the northern sector of the plain, where the Quaternary alluvial-coastal deposits are thicker because of the structural asymmetry of the graben . The maximum subsidence rate, however, can be observed in the central part of the plain, in correspondence of the Sele, Tusciano and Picentino river mouths and in the coastal belt. This could be related to the thickness of loose sediments (&gt;20 m) and to the presence of still compacting clay-rich sediments. In the southernmost sector the rates are the lowest recorded in the plain due to the minor thickness of Holocene deposits and to the presence of very thick sedimentary bodies of travertine . The understanding of subsidence patterns may represent a basic tool for future studies about the assessment of the coastal inundation hazard and related risk mitigation in the Sele River plain . Such a tool may reinforce the methodological approach to risk assessment in similar morphological settings. ]"

The SBM-Undesirable model and SuperSBM-Undesirable model are used to calculate the growth of the GTFP of the marine economy. The growth of GTFP of the marine economy is used to represent the high-quality development level of the marine economy. The nonlinear relationship between marine technology innovation and the growth of GTFP of the marine economy is examined. , In recent years, the Chinese government attaches great importance to the development of a high-quality marine economy. The Ministry of Natural Resources issued the opinions on promoting the high-quality development of the marine economy, which pointed out that technology innovation should play a leading role in the high-quality development of the marine economy. In this paper, we use a comprehensive weight model including the entropy method and the best-worst method (BWM) to measure the level of marine technology innovation in China's coastal regions from 2006 to 2016. Then, we use the threshold regression model to examine the role of marine technology innovation in the high-quality development of the marine economy. The results show that there is a nonlinear relationship between marine technology innovation and high-quality development of the marine economy. Furthermore, we find that when the level of marine technology innovation exceeds a certain threshold, its promotion effect of the high-quality development of the marine economy gradually weakens. Finally, we analyze the reasons for the above findings and discuss the corresponding policy suggestions. ]"

Some studies have investigated short-term interactions, and some models predict short turnover times at the sediment surface on open shorelines . However, buried plastics may be retained longer in wetlands where accretion is often high, and some studies suggest their use as historical markers. The ubiquity, persistence, and behavior of plastic particles within wetlands warrants their consideration as novel sedimentary particles. Viewing plastics in this context will allow land managers to better predict how these vulnerable systems respond to increasing inputs of plastic pollution.

Critical assessment of coastal GDEs’ current status and management challenges. Transdisciplinary approach to highlight major dysfunctions in coastal GDEs management. Identification of important deficiencies in definition, legislation and management. Missing knowledge and involvement hinder the sustainable development of coastal areas. , Coastal lagoons deliver a wide range of valuable ecosystem goods and services. These ecosystems, that are often maintained by direct or indirect groundwater supplies, are collectively known as groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs). The importance of groundwater supplies is greatly exacerbated in coastal Mediterranean regions where the lack of surface water and the over-development of anthropogenic activities critically threaten the sustainability of coastal GDEs and associated ecosystem services. Yet, coastal GDEs do not benefit from a legal or managerial recognition to take into account their specificity. Particular attention should be paid to the characterization of environmental and ecological water requirements. The hydrogeological knowledge about the management and behavior of coastal aquifers and GDEs must be strengthened. These investigations must be supplemented by a stronger assessment of potential contaminations to develop local land-uses and human activities according to the groundwater vulnerability. The quantitative management of water resources must also be better supervised and/or more constrained in order to ensure the water needs necessary to maintain coastal GDEs. The transdisciplinary approach between hydrogeology , hydrology, social sciences and law is essential to fully understand the socio-economic and environmental complexity of coastal GDEs. Priority must now be given to the development of an appropriate definition of coastal GDEs, based on a consensus between scientists and lawyers. It is a necessary first step to develop and implement specific protective legislation and to define an appropriate management scale. The investment and collaboration of local water users, stakeholders and decision-makers need to be strengthened through actions to favor exchanges and discussions. All water resources in the coastal areas should be managed collectively and strategically, in order to maximize use efficiency, reduce water use conflicts and avoid over-exploitation. It is important to continue to raise public awareness of coastal aquifers at the regional level and to integrate their specificities into coastal zone management strategies and plans. In the global context of unprecedented anthropogenic pressures, hydro-food crises and climate change, environmental protection and preservation of coastal GDEs represents a major challenge for the sustainable socio-economic and environmental development of Mediterranean coastal zones. ]"

Improved sediment transport, nearshore circulation, morphodynamics models are needed. , This paper summarizes the findings of a workshop convened in the United States in 2018 to discuss methods in coastal and estuarine modeling and to propose key areas of research and development needed to improve their accuracy and reliability. The focus of this paper is on physical processes, and we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art based on presentations and discussions at the meeting, which revolved around the four primary themes of parameterizations, numerical methods , in-situ and remote-sensing measurements, and high-performance computing. A primary outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to reduce subjectivity and improve reproducibility in modeling of physical processes in the coastal ocean. Reduction of subjectivity can be accomplished through development of standards for benchmarks, grid generation, and validation, and reproducibility can be improved through development of standards for input/output, coupling and model nesting, and reporting. Subjectivity can also be reduced through more engagement with the applied mathematics and computer science communities to develop methods for robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Such engagement could be encouraged through more collaboration between the forward and inverse modeling communities and integration of more applied math and computer science into oceanography curricula. Another outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to develop high-resolution models that scale on advanced HPC systems to resolve, rather than parameterize, processes with horizontal scales that range between the depth and the internal Rossby deformation scale. Unsurprisingly, more research is needed on parameterizations of processes at scales smaller than the depth, including parameterizations for drag (including bottom roughness, bedforms , vegetation and corals), wave breaking, and air–sea interactions under strong wind conditions. Other topics that require significantly more work to better parameterize include nearshore wave modeling, sediment transport modeling, and morphodynamics . Finally, it was agreed that coastal models should be considered as key infrastructure needed to support research, just like laboratory facilities, field instrumentation, and research vessels. This will require a shift in the way proposals related to coastal ocean modeling are reviewed and funded. ]"

Towards this aim, understanding the complex relationships between coastal well-being and ecosystem services provides a foundation for a range of management and governance interventions. While these relationships are considered in a growing number of case-based studies, the complexity of these linkages has not been comprehensively assessed. We use a systematic review protocol of 50 articles published between 2008 and 2018 to assess the evidence about the interplay among coastal well-being and ecosystem services. We find that empirical research has fallen behind theoretical development in five key areas: 1) geographic diversity; 2) disaggregated data; 3) temporal dynamics; 4) co-production, and; 5) uncertainty of outcomes. We highlight these gaps as frontiers for interdisciplinary coastal well-being and ecosystem service research. Together, the five frontiers chart a potential new research agenda for coastal well-being and ecosystem services research, namely one that involves more cases and authors from the Global South, that explicitly explores social differentiation and changes overtime, that is collaborative from the start, and that engages empirically with the complexity and uncertainty of well-being-ecosystem service interactions and their implications for enhancing management.

Increasing risks associated with environmental change along with highly degraded coastal ecosystems encompass complex management challenges for the long-term sustainability of these landscapes. This article aims to explore the role of protected areas in past and ongoing community adaptation to the compounded effects of climatic and anthropogenic change. A literature review of published articles is conducted through systematic queries of the bibliographic database Web of Sciences, and by comparing adaptation and social-ecological resilience processes within and out of coastal protected areas. Findings underscore the absence of specific studies that target these topics inside protected areas, highlighting a geographic bias towards research largely carried out in developed countries. Results also indicate the current need for management practices within protected areas to adopt more participatory, comprehensive, and flexible approaches.

The practical use of this naturally occurring light signal in environmental research is, however, under-exploited, particularly in research focusing on optically complex waters such as inland and coastal waters.

Marine microplastics predominantly originate near the coast and can remain in the nearshore zone for some time. However, at present, there is little understanding of the fate and transport of microplastics in coastal regions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the physical processes involved in the movement of microplastics from estuaries to the continental shelf . The trajectory and speed of microplastics are controlled by their physical characteristics (density, size, and shape) and ocean dynamic conditions (wind, waves, tides, thermohaline gradients, and the influence of benthic sediments). Microplastic particles can be subjected to beaching, surface drifting, vertical mixing, and biofouling, as well as bed-load and suspended load transport processes, until reaching terminal deposition on beaches, in coastal marshes , in benthic sediments or until they are carried by ocean currents to subtropical convergence zones. The dynamic interaction of released microplastics with the shoreline is regulated by onshore/offshore transport, which is impacted by the source location as well as the geometry, vegetation, tidal regime, and wave direction. Wind and wave conditions dominate surface drifting of buoyant particles through Ekman drift, windage, and Stokes drift mechanisms. Neustic microplastic particles travel in the subsurface because of vertical mixing through wind-driven Langmuir circulation and heat cycling. Increasing accumulation of microplastics in benthic sediments needs to be quantitatively explored in terms of biofouling, deposition, entrainment, and transport dynamics. Further studies are required to understand the following: 1) the primary parameters (e.g., windage, terminal velocity , diffusivity , critical shear stress) that determine microplastic transport in different pathways; 2) dynamic distribution of microplastics in various coastal landscapes (e.g., wetlands , beaches, estuaries, lagoons , barrier islands, depocenters) regulated by hydrodynamic conditions; and 3) interactions between the physical transport processes and biochemical reactions (degradation, flocculation , biofouling, ingestions). ]"

The result of sixty relevant studies showed that polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury (Hg) were the focus of biomagnification of pollutants among the 184 recorded pollutants. Biomagnification effects of the same pollutant calculated by using TMF and BMF were similar. According to the values of TMF and BMF among all pollutants, the results indicated that there were 67 with low (1 &lt; TMF ≤ ≤ 4), 43 with greater (4 &lt; TMF ≤ ≤ 10), and 14 with the greatest risk (TMF &gt; 10) while 71 organic pollutants without biomagnification risk (TMF ≤ ≤ 1). Only 2 trace metals (Hg and Zn) were identified as having biomagnification effects. Cs and Se were trace metals with biomagnification that might have been overlooked. The effectiveness of biomagnification of the same pollutant was related to pollutant morphology, food webs, predator–prey relationships, the individual organism, the selection of wet weight and lipid weight and pollutant morphology. Thus, pollutant morphology, the accurate use of key parameters of trophic level , the strict screening of individual animals and the reasonable selection of wet weight and lipid weight are crucial.

Algal species used must be chosen locally. Ulva or Padina species are recommended to be used on the Arabian gulf coast. , The transporting of oil via the Arabian Gulf for centuries has resulted in the pollution of the coasts by heavy metals, and therefore, remediation actions are needed. In this review, we first evaluated heavy metal pollution on the coasts by assembling the research on published metal concentrations in sediments and water bodies surrounding the Arabian Peninsula . Research revealed uneven pollution of heavy metals, meaning that before remediation, the most polluted sites should be found. This could be done most conveniently using biomonitoring. The Arabian Peninsula is a unique ecoregion due to the extremely high temperature in summer, and therefore, it needs its specific standardization procedure for biomonitoring. To get an overview of the current information on biomonitoring, we gathered a dataset of 306 published macroalgal observations from the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Aden. The heavy metal concentration dataset of macroalgae was analyzed with a multivariate principal component analysis. As a result of the published works elsewhere and our data analysis, we recommend that green Ulva and brown Padina species are used in the biomonitoring of heavy metal pollution on the Arabian Peninsula's eastern and southern coasts. However, more species might be needed if these species do not occur at the site. The species incidence should first be monitored systematically in each area, and common species should be used. The species used should be chosen locally and sampled at the same depth at low tide in spring or early summer, from February to May, before the hottest season.

New mainland barrier subclasses Antecedent role of Pleistocene barrier: Holocene bays, lagoons Transgressive barrier subcategories; Chandeleurs, LA vs. Outer Banks, NC Comparison of aggradation , detachment hypotheses; strandplains as process archives AL-MS and Chandeleur island chain history and future: new data , Based on numerous publications and field work on the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, U.S. and other coastal areas, the present objective is to meet the need for an improved system of the definition and classification of barriers and their components. This topic includes morphological and functional interrelationships between beach ridges, barriers, and similar landforms . The term “beach ridge” was applied to a plethora of sub- and supratidal ridge types. In contrast, the presently proposed definition restricts the term to relict berm and foredune ridges, composed of sand or gravel and stabilized after isolation from shore zone of active processes. Barriers sustain paralic hydrology, sediment, biotic and nutrient condition in the coastal realm. In combination with adjacent lagoons and river deltas, these landforms represent physical barriers that lessen marine and related influences in brackish paralic-coastal environments. Benefiting from historic evolution of concepts and nomenclature, the task also involves the correction of misattributions rooted in early publications. Island, spit, and mainland barriers thus maintain lower salinities , reduce wave erosion, protect nutrient-rich paralic deposits and mitigate storm-induced inundation. “Fetch-limited lagoonal barrier islands” are considered valid barriers only in lagoons where they face inlet-transmitted full-marine conditions. “Mainland barriers” of several subcategories often are important sediment archives of past sea levels, hydroclimate, climate and tectonic-isostatic changes. They consist mostly of ridgeplains, at the start firmly attached or later migrated and welded to the mainland shore. In addition to local hydrodynamic and topographic influences, formation conditions may reflect overall paleogeographic conditions, including fluvial impact. In progradational (regressive) island settings, barriers islands of strandplains that laterally may alternate with narrow spit-like sectors. They include only single, marine, respectively, lagoon-side shore ridges, with secondary dune fields sandwiched between them. Field observations and drillcore studies of microfossil- and sediment-based depositional facies suggest that most barrier islands originated by the often underestimated shoal-aggradation mode. Two additional genetic models are recognizable; a fourth remains hypothetical. Remotely-sensed images indicate that post-hurricane regeneration of the largest deltaic barrier chain in the Gulf of Mexico stalled in recent years. Late Pleistocene barriers significantly influenced present coastal landforms in two extensive regions. Dramatic changes in past decades indicate that sea-level rise and stormier future hydroclimate may likely accelerate the degradation of deltaic and non-deltaic barrier islands. ]"

In Brazil, a country that presents one of the largest mangrove areas on the planet, recent political changes considered mangroves as “Permanent Preservation Areas” with the environmental function of preserving their ecosystem services. Under this regulation, mangrove deforestation is allowed in cases of regularization of irregular occupations and consolidated urban areas. However, these political changes may not be an effective to prevent mangrove deforestation in the country. This study aimed to analyze mangrove deforestation over twenty years in Santos and São Vicente estuarine region located at the Baixada Santista region (southeastern of Brazil), a highly vulnerable region subject to intense land use pressure by urban occupation and activities of the largest port of Latin America. Using remote sensing spatial analysis techniques, we analyzed if changes in Brazilian legislation has been reflected in degradation of mangrove forests over a period of twenty years due to the presence of vulnerable mangroves and accelerate land use pressure by urban occupation and activities of the largest port of Latin America. Findings show that, approximately 10.6 km 2 of mangroves in this region have been lost mainly due to irregular low-income occupation processes. The greatest gross loss occurred between the years 1999 and 2011 (8.1 km 2 ). Land regularization has caused mangrove reduction of only 0.03 km 2 in 2014, but it is possible that, in this case, mangrove forests were replaced by distinct vegetation physiognomy altering the original vegetation pattern. Demand for mangrove legislation that considers both social adaptation and legal protection has grown to support socioenvironmental vulnerability assessments.

After reviewing the different methodologies in evaluating ICZM, two approaches were selected as recommended by Billé (2007) and Gallagher (2010). It was anticipated that by merging the results of the two approaches, each would be capable of filling the gaps of the other one. Interestingly, it was found that the two methodologies together provided a comprehensive evaluation of ICZM efforts. However, on the other hand, it was discovered that ICZM efforts in Penang were disadvantaged by the absence of an authoritative agency having overall responsibility, lack of horizontal and vertical integration between the different sectors and levels (regulations and acts concerning the coastal zone are implemented by different agencies at State and Federal levels), and poor institutional capacity. Although, in the present management system, adequate consideration has been given to communication and the participation of related stakeholders. Therefore, based on the findings of this study, ICZM in Penang is close to becoming an effective tool for managing coastal areas. However, the present management approach is proprietary.

Sea-level rise and vulnerability pose constraints to adaptation. Climate Change puts demands on coastal management. There is a pressing need to foster adaptive capacity in coastal areas. , Low-Elevation Coastal Zones in Central and South America are exposed to climate-related hazards (sea-level rise, climate variability and storms) which threaten the assets (people, resources, ecosystems, infrastructure, and the services they provide), and are expected to increase due to climate change. A non-systematic review is presented focusing on vulnerability elements, impacts, constraints to adaptation, and their possible strategies. The analysis emphasises the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Reasons for Concern (e.g., threatened systems, extreme events, aggregated impacts, and critical thresholds), particularly on sea-level rise, degradation of mangroves , and invasive alien species in Central and South America focusing on case studies from Uruguay and Venezuela. Despite recent advances in coastal adaptation planning in Central and South America, there is an adaptation deficit in the implementation of measures and strategies against climate-related hazards, such as sea-level rise. Adaptation constraints are linked with poverty, resource allocation, lack of political will, and lack of early warning systems for climate-related hazards. Non-structural adaptation measures such as community-based adaptation and ecosystem-based adaptation are not fully mainstreamed into national plans yet. Government-level initiatives (e.g. National Adaptation Programmes of Action) are being developed, but a few are already implemented. In addition to specific thematic measures, the implementation of non-structural approaches, National Adaptation Programmes of Action and early warning systems, based on the reasons for concern, should foster adaptive capacity in coastal areas. ]"

Inundation of saline marsh is the largest contributor to wetland loss (&gt;40% of total). Loss of fresh wetlands due to salinity is &lt;10% of wetland loss coastwide. Wetland loss responds to both linear (chronic) and non-linear (acute) stressors. Understanding the inundation tolerance for different species/mixtures is crucial. , This study uses modeling results for coastal Louisiana to examine spatial and temporal variation in future wetland loss, and how this variation is influenced by different causes of land loss represented in the modeled processes. Fifty-year model predictions illustrate specific vulnerabilities of the wetlands and the conditions under which they occur, e.g., long-term changes vs. specific events. Environmental scenarios were used to examine model sensitivity to changes in future patterns of precipitation, evapotranspiration , subsidence , and eustatic sea level rise . Based on the model results, the magnitude of wetland loss increases more than three-fold from low to high scenario. The model allows vegetation types to change over time as environmental conditions change. Each type is sensitive to different land-loss causing factors. Across all scenarios, the largest contributor to wetland loss is inundation loss of saline marsh -&gt;40% of loss. Inundation loss of brackish marsh increases from low to high scenarios. Salinity induced loss of fresh wetlands increases from low to high scenario and coastwide contributes &lt;10% of the total wetland loss. Marsh edge erosion is relatively consistent in magnitude across scenarios but its relative contribution decreases from low to high. Model outputs show two contrasting responses to environmental change over a 50-year simulation: a relatively linear response of land area over time, and a non-linear response where a large collapse event is triggered in a single year. Land loss varied dramatically over time within the 50-year simulations with little loss in the first two decades and high rates of loss 25–40 years into the future. Across most of the coast, and for all scenarios, the majority of land loss is caused by excessive inundation. Understanding the threshold conditions for inundation for different species and species mixtures is crucial to predictions of vegetation change, and subsequent wetland loss. ]"

We inferred the geographical position of six mud depocenters in relation to the hydrodynamic conditions evolved from predominant winds and morphometry . Littoral zones of sediment resuspension dominated by sand were identified where current velocity was higher than 0.2 m s −1 and depth was &lt;5 m.

Coastal erosion started from the 1970’s and became a very serious problem at 1990’s. The dramatic decrease of sediment supplies from rivers caused rapid erosion at the delta and estuary areas, especially in the abandoned Yellow River Delta. Most sandy coasts along the Peninsula were eroded due to lack of sand supply and interruption of alongshore sediment drift, sand dredging from the beach or the offshore area caused serious erosion during short time. Sea-level rise causes slow but constant shoreline retreats and became a more serious threat. Different types of hard solutions for coastal protection against erosion were used in Shandong. Seawalls are most widely used, especially at the Yellow River Delta and city center waterfront. Groynes, jetties and breakwater are used on the north and east sandy coast of the Peninsula. Hard approaches are effective to protect the coast erosion but not change the erosion causes and led secondary impact on the coast. Soft engineering solution or the combined solutions are taken into acts. Beach nourishment is mostly considered as the better soft solution, especially to those tourists attracting sandy beaches along the Shandong coast. Long term monitoring and continuous lessons learning from the coastal erosion management will be adaptive for better coast solution in the future. ]"

Wetland losses also reduce the primary production by plants that would otherwise bury carbon in the future. More than 50% of these ecosystems have been lost globally over the last half century, with this number approaching 58% in China. The negotiation of international accords such as the Paris Climate Agreement rely on the accurate assessment of ecosystem-held carbon quantities. Our objective was to provide the first national scale survey of coastal wetland-based carbon in China. The average soil organic carbon stock (Mg SOC ha −1 ) across all three types of ecosystems was 236.91, with an average of 344.67 for mangroves , 175.14 for seagrass , and 134.37 for salt marshes. The SOC stock was greatest at 30–60 cm of depth in the case of mangroves, as opposed to 0–20 cm of depth for salt marshes. In terms of the carbon content of the standing aboveground and belowground biomass (Mg C ha −1 ), mangroves contained by far the most with an average of 253.98 and 83.96, respectively. Carbon burial rates, or the annual flux of SOC into the soil column (Mg C ha −1 yr −1 ), were 2.26 ± 0.39 for mangroves, 1.38 ± 0.38 for seagrass, and 2.18 ± 0.24 for salt marshes. Through our work, we found a total of 48.12–123.95 Tg of C in China's coastal wetlands (down to 1 m of soil column depth), with an annual burial of 0.84 Tg yr −1 .

Erosion affects many activities related to economic growth. Current climate change conditions demand adequate coastal erosion management strategies. The coastal erosion management using ecosystems is cost-effective and sustainable. The success of this strategy will depend on the determination of realistic operational objectives and indicators. , With a global increase in coastal development, together with increasing storminess and continuing sea level rise , coastal erosion has become a serious problem along a significant percentage of coastlines of many countries. Coastal erosion and shoreline management plans are often implemented on an action-reaction and post-disaster basis, resulting in installation of hard engineering structures, such as, groins, seawalls, revetments , gabions and breakwaters. These hard stabilization structures usually alter the natural environment of the coast, producing negative impacts. They do little to work with nature, and sustainability is a currently a critical issue. Under present and future environmental conditions, the world requires smarter coastal protection strategies that are adaptable, sustainable, multi-functional and economically viable to help solve immediate and predicted coastal erosion problems. An ecosystem-based approach based on the creation and restoration of coastal ecosystems , such as wetlands (e.g. mangroves), biogenic reef structures (e.g. corals, oysters, and mussels), seagrass beds and dune vegetation can offer optimal natural alternatives to help solve coastal erosion. Coastal ecosystems have some capacity for self-repair and recovery, and can provide significant advantages over traditional hard engineering approaches against coastal erosion. Also, they play a vital role in reducing the susceptibility of coastal communities to hazards through their multiple roles in processes, including sediment capture, system roughness and thus attenuation of wave energy. This paper seeks to undertake a general review of adaptation and protection measures against coastal erosion issues, based on incorporation of ecology and ecosystem services into coastal erosion management strategies. ]"

Zanzibar coasts are confronted with pressures from population increase, urbanization and emerging coastal activities. The environment state of Zanzibar coasts is altered and the consequences are affecting its socio-ecological systems. Several legislative measures consider the coastal zone in Zanzibar but the reality shows a failure of ad hoc management. A shift for the better may be taking place and increasing interest toward integrated coastal and marine spatial planning. , The coastal zone of Zanzibar, Tanzania, is culturally, socially, economically, and ecologically unique but there is a lack of baseline information about its state characteristics as a whole. This paper provides a holistic assessment of the environmental and socio-economic settings of the Zanzibar coastal zone with its unusual physiographic characteristics and key habitats such as coral reefs, mangroves , and seagrass meadows . The human livelihood of Zanzibar is unmistakably coastal with its many cultural adaptations but the most recent decades have shown drastic changes in the prevailing seaborne and coastal activities. This development has not been without disputes among the different interest groups. The driver-pressure-state-impact-response approach allows to scrutinize the socio-ecological system circles of the Zanzibar coastal zone. Systematically, the approach provides interlink of the drivers and with their impacts on the socio-economic systems and the appropriate responses necessary to combat the impacts. The main drivers identified to be the population increase, urbanization with settlement expansion, and the rapid expansion of the shore-dwelling tourism with its associated infrastructures. These factors are adversely impacting the coastal and marine nature and the traditional socio-economic systems. The Zanzibar government has put forward several initiatives to protect the health of the coastal ecosystems and the endurance of the traditional cultures. The effective implementation of measures, for example, the Zanzibar Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning as part of the National Land Use Plan , have not yet been sufficient to restore the situation. However, there are also signs of commitment being fostered and an improvement in the know-how for making changes.

First, some fundamental differences in the hydrodynamics of the coastal ocean, such as the large surface elevation variation compared to the mean water depth, are contrasted against large scale ocean dynamics. Then the hydrodynamic equations as they are used in coastal ocean models as well as in large scale ocean models are presented, including parameterisations for turbulent transports. As steps towards discretisation, coordinate transformations and spatial discretisations based on a finite-volume approach are discussed with focus on the specific requirements for coastal ocean models. As in large scale ocean models, splitting of internal and external modes is essential also for coastal ocean models, but specific care is needed when drying &amp; flooding of intertidal flats is included. As one obvious characteristic of coastal ocean models, open boundaries occur and need to be treated in a way that correct model forcing from outside is transmitted to the model domain without reflecting waves from the inside.

These trends create a strong and sustained demand for land reclamation and infrastructure protection in coastal areas, requiring engineered coastal defence structures such as sea walls. Here, we review the nature of ecological impacts of coastal structures on intertidal ecosystems, seek to understand the extent to which ecological engineering can mitigate these impacts, and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation as a tool to contribute to conservation of intertidal habitats. By so doing, we identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future research. Coastal structures alter important physical, chemical and biological processes of intertidal habitats, and strongly impact community structure, inter-habitat linkages and ecosystem services while also driving habitat loss. Such impacts occur diffusely across localised sites but scale to significant regional and global levels. Recent advances in ecological engineering have focused on developing habitat complexity on coastal structures to increase biodiversity. ‘Soft’ engineering options maximise habitat complexity through inclusion of natural materials, species and processes, while simultaneously delivering engineering objectives such as coastal protection. Soft options additionally sustain multiple services, providing greater economic benefits for society, and resilience to climatic change. Currently however, a lack of inclusion and economic undervaluation of intertidal ecosystem services may undermine best practice in coastline management. Importantly, reviewed evidence shows mitigation and even restoration do not support intertidal communities or processes equivalent to pre-disturbance conditions. Crucially, an absence of comprehensive empirical baseline biodiversity data, or data comprising additional ecological parameters such as ecosystem functions and services, prohibits quantification of absolute and relative magnitudes of ecological impacts due to coastal structures or effectiveness of mitigation interventions. This knowledge deficit restricts evaluation of the potential of ecological engineering to contribute to conservation policies for intertidal habitats. To improve mitigation design and effectiveness, a greater focus on in-situ research is needed, requiring stronger and timely collaboration between government agencies, construction partners and research scientists. ]"

These quantitative models enable geoscientists to explain and forecast coastal and estuarine morphogenetic processes. Reducing model (predictive) uncertainties requires increasing awareness and reconsideration of common fundamental principles upon which existing models have built. Based on a review of most of the existing morphogenetic models applicable on open oceanic coasts and in estuaries , we use the Exner equations to clarify the potential of individual models. Fundamental coastal and estuarine behaviours, and cautions required when implementing the models, are also discussed on the basis of the Exner equations. Major differences between and difficulties with these models are in the derivation and computation of vertical and horizontal sediment fluxes; these can be even more complicated in estuaries than on open coasts because it is more important to consider estuarine systems in three dimensions and to account for a wider range of grain sizes. In addition, estuaries typically experience more complex interplay between physical and ecological processes as well as connections with both hinterland and the open coast. Tackling these difficulties requires more observational data to derive increasingly reliable parameterizations of sediment fluxes. Future model development and application across a range of spatial-temporal scales should be based on the Exner equations, modified to suit local coastal and estuarine settings, and incorporating natural complexities and hierarchical landform features. ]"

We present recommendations for research priorities that target better understanding of the ecological impacts of acidification in the U. S. Mid-Atlantic region. Suggested priorities are: 1) Determining the impact of multiple stressors on our resource species as well as the magnitude of acidification; 2) Filling information gaps on major taxa and regionally important species in different life stages to improve understanding of their response to variable temporal scales and sources of acidification; 3) Improving experimental approaches to incorporate realistic environmental variability and gradients, include interactions with other environmental stressors, increase transferability to other systems or organisms, and evaluate community and ecosystem response; 4) Determining the capacity of important species to acclimate or adapt to changing ocean conditions; 5) Considering multi-disciplinary, ecosystem-level research that examines acidification impacts on biodiversity and biotic interactions; and 6) Connecting potential acidification-induced ecological impacts to ecosystem services and the economy.

There has been much discussion about projected (and the sources of projection) vs. measured SLR rates. Which rates should coastal scientists and managers apply in their studies, and what is the degree of confidence of such forecasts, are still open questions. This paper reviews the patterns and effects of relative SLR (RSLR) in coastal lagoons . Three main components are presented in the review: (a) a summary of the main approaches used in predicting medium- to long-term trends in RSLR, (b) a summary of the main evolutionary trends of coastal lagoons and the tools used to examine such trends, and (c) an identification of future research needs. The review reveals that the major source of uncertainty is how and when RSLR will manifest itself at different spatio-temporal scales in coastal lagoon systems, and how its effects can be mitigated. Most of the studies reviewed herein articulate a natural ‘defence’ mechanism of barriers in coastal lagoons by landward barrier retreat through continuous migration, and a gradual change in basin hypsometry during the retreat process. So far, only a relatively small number of detailed studies have integrated and quantified human impacts and coastal lagoon evolution induced by RSLR. We conclude that much more research about adaptation measures is needed, taking into consideration not only the physical and ecological systems but also social, cultural, and economic impacts. Future challenges include a downscaling of SLR approaches from the global level to regional and local levels, with a detailed application of coastal evolution prediction to individual coastal lagoon systems. ]"

Levels of uncertainty in the hazards could be better communicated. Risk management provides a way to incorporate uncertainty more transparently. , Determination of coastal hazard lines is a key task for coastal engineers worldwide. While current practice differs from country to country and even within countries, in many coastal hazard assessments three main components of coastline recession are taken into account: episodic recession due to storm erosion, long term recession due to an imbalance in sediment transport , and recession due to sea-level rise. In Australia, the state of New South Wales has a well-established procedure for the definition of coastal hazards that has evolved since the 1970's.

The extreme environmental conditions that characterize Qatar has led to fauna that are robust compared with other regions, but makes them highly sensitive to further pressure from anthropogenic stress. These vulnerable ecosystems have come under increasing pressure in recent decades as a result of dramatic expansion of coastal development, and threats to these ecosystems are likely to accelerate in the coming years as Qatar's economy and population continue to grow. Although environmental regulation had historically lagged behind the rapid pace of development, in recent years Qatar's leadership has aggressively expanded environmental management as a result of the growing awareness of the importance of coastal ecosystems . While these improvements are encouraging, management remains challenged by its current sectorial, project-driven focus. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) offers an opportunity to overcome these challenges by integrating impacts from across all major activities in multiple sectors and considering their cumulative effects on ecosystem services and products. While an EBM approach would require modest reprioritizing of existing processes and attention to addressing deficiencies in data needed to support decision making , it has the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of coastal zone management . The article closes by summarizing a recently initiated research project on coral reefs and seagrass beds in Qatar which can serve as a model for development of the EBM approach for other coastal ecosystems in Qatar. ]"

They provide a simplified form to communicate complex data and information, and constitute a facilitator mechanism in the dialog among stakeholders. In this work, a review on the use of geoindicators in sandy coastal environments is performed. It was found that, despite the obvious advantages in reporting the state of the coast using geoindicators, their generalized adoption seems to be stalled and is limited to a few management settings and particular projects. The existence of a myriad of coastal geoindicators, that frequently are poorly defined, is identified as the major difficulty in their widespread use. The present work aims to contribute towards the establishment of a common framework for coastal geoindicators, focusing on sandy coastal environments. The main objective of the compilation and definition of the indicators herein presented is to simplify and clarify their designations, and objectively present the measurement and reporting criteria aiming at a consensus-based approach. Sixteen coastal geoindicators are identified as relevant for the description of the state of beach, coastal dunes , and coastal barrier environments. This effort contributes to the adoption of coastal geoindicators as an effective communication tool leading to a more standardized report on the state of the coastal zone. ]"

In the Baltic Sea, shallow productive habitats in the coastal zone such as wetlands , vegetated flads/lagoons and sheltered bays as well as more exposed rocky and sandy areas are utilized by fish across many life history stages including spawning, juvenile development, feeding and migration. Although there is general consensus about the critical importance of these essential fish habitats (EFH) for fish production along the coast, direct quantitative evidence for their specific roles in population growth and maintenance is still scarce. Nevertheless, for some coastal species, indirect evidence exists, and in many cases, sufficient data are also available to carry out further quantitative analyses. As coastal EFH in the Baltic Sea are often found in areas that are highly utilized and valued by humans, they are subjected to many different pressures. While cumulative pressures, such as eutrophication , coastal construction and development, climate change, invasive species and fisheries, impact fish in coastal areas, the conservation coverage for EFH in these areas remains poor. This is mainly due to the fact that historically, fisheries management and nature conservation are not integrated neither in research nor in management in Baltic Sea countries. Setting joint objectives for fisheries management and nature conservation would hence be pivotal for improved protection of EFH in the Baltic Sea. To properly inform management, improvements in the development of monitoring strategies and mapping methodology for EFH are also needed. Stronger international cooperation between Baltic Sea states will facilitate improved management outcomes across ecologically arbitrary boundaries. This is especially important for successful implementation of international agreements and legislative directives such as the Baltic Sea Action Plan, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Habitats Directive, and the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, but also for improving the communication of information related to coastal EFH among researchers, stakeholders, managers and decision makers. In this paper, efforts are made to characterize coastal EFH in the Baltic Sea, their importance and the threats/pressures they face, as well as their current conservation status, while highlighting knowledge gaps and outlining perspectives for future work in an ecosystem-based management framework. ]"

The coastal resources of the region sustained native tribes for thousands of years prior to European settlement, and those resources sustained early settlers, allowing them to expand throughout the region. By the late 1600s, the city of Boston was the most influential shipping and trading city in the new colonies. Continuous growth of the region throughout the 18 t h t h and 19 t h t h centuries, however, strained those resources. Extensive areas of coastal wetlands were filled for urban development, resident wastewater was disposed of in the Harbor, and industrialization of the waterfront resulted in additional point source contamination. By the 1980s, Boston Harbor was considered among the most polluted harbors in the country. Extensive efforts in recent years, however, have restored the water quality in the Harbor and revitalized the waterfront region. Below we describe the socio-economic and ecological resources of the region, explore the current threats Boston Harbor faces, and highlight two examples of actions that helped restore the Harbor to its current conditions. ]"

We review theoretical approaches and empirical studies from European countries about environmental and natural resource use conflicts with the aim to clarify the requirements for developing interdisciplinary coastal conflict research as a component of sustainable coastal management. Issues of terminology, conceptual and methodological differences and requirements for analysing and solving resource use and management conflicts are addressed. Thereafter, possibilities of consolidation of the research field and the perspectives of future coastal conflict research are discussed – along with comparative studies of conflicts, conflict management, and integration of the knowledge of resource users.

Federal programs have failed in part by not including projected rates of sea-level and erosion. State/local regulations have failed to protect beaches/dunes due to legal flaws (e.g., variances). Lack of consistent political foresight, will, and enforcement is the primary reason regulations fail. , This perspective examines case examples, primarily from the U. S. Carolinas and Alabama, that illustrate some of the flaws of four federal programs of the last 50 years (National Flood Insurance Program, U. S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act, Coastal Area Management Act, Stafford Disaster Relief Act), as well as general reasons for state and local regulation failures. The latter include: variances that undercut the regulatory intent by the tyranny of small decisions, emergency dispensations, and compensatory mitigation; allowances for ‘temporary’ shore-hardening structures that become permanent; establishing control lines that are not adjusted to shifting shorelines ; over-simplifying (one-size-fits-all) and misapplying (importing inappropriate strategies) regulations; conflicting jurisdictional boundaries; and the political instability of regulatory laws. Political-legislative realm failures include: 1) generalized laws do not match the complexity of coasts; 2) legislators lack the foresight to provide funding for regulatory monitoring/enforcement/penalties; 3) legislative bodies lack continuity of visions or goals for the future (e.g., overturn or weaken prior regulatory legislation); and 4) politicians are subject to conflicts of interest (e.g., affluent coastal land owners; pro-development lobbies). The political-legislative disconnect from the reality of Nature, and failure to use longer-term projections of erosion rates , sediment supply, and effects of sea-level rise, are the most frequent culprits in regulatory failure. New starting points for sound regulatory coastal management are better-informed politicians with the will to enact laws based on science that reflect natural variability, and laws that are unflawed by variances or over simplification. Regulations need to have continuity, proper funding, and enforcement. ]"

Coastal adaptation that incorporates the evaluation of long-term options is in its infancy in Australia. The framing of risk and uncertainty is critical to the evaluation outcomes. Assumptions used in current practice are too simplistic for the evaluation timeframes. Current practice should use more non-probabilistic scenarios to support evaluations. , Rising sea levels have the potential to alter coastal flooding regimes around the world and local governments are beginning to consider how to manage uncertain coastal change. In doing so, there is increasing recognition that such change is deeply uncertain and unable to be reliably described with probabilities or a small number of scenarios. Characteristics of methodologies applied in Australian practice to evaluate long-term coastal adaptation options are reviewed and benchmarked against two state-of-the-art international methods suited for conditions of uncertainty (Robust Decision Making and Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways). Seven out of the ten Australian case studies assumed the uncertain parameters, such as sea level rise , could be described deterministically or stochastically when identifying risk and evaluating adaptation options across multi-decadal periods. This basis is not considered sophisticated enough for long-term decision-making, implying that Australian practice needs to increase the use of scenarios to explore a much larger uncertainty space when assessing the performance of adaptation options. Two Australian case studies mapped flexible adaptation pathways to manage uncertainty, and there remains an opportunity to incorporate quantitative methodologies to support the identification of risk thresholds. The contextual framing of risk, including the approach taken to identify risk (top-down or bottom-up) and treatment of uncertain parameters, were found to be fundamental characteristics that influenced the methodology selected to evaluate adaptation options. The small sample of case studies available suggests that long-term coastal adaptation in Australian is in its infancy and there is a timely opportunity to guide local government towards robust methodologies for developing long-term coastal adaptation plans. ]"

Reliefs in these basins together with massif palaeogeography and palaeotopography strongly control the spatial distribution of facies belts and complex lateral facies changes between very different coeval sub-environments, leading to mixtures of sedimentary particles with variable composition. Palaeotopography and palaeogeography also control the distribution of flora palaeohabitats in the desert basins depending on the spatial distribution of fresh water, the basin geometry, the topographic variability and associated phreatic level, as well as the effective distance from highlands to the coast. The Albian desert basin that developed in northern Iberia presents similarities with the geomorphology of modern Oman, UAE and Eritrea desert coasts. In both systems (Cretaceous and Holocene) the distance between highlands and arid coastline determines the occurrence of extensive aeolian sand seas (e.g. wide desert basin where distance between the highlands and the coastline increases) or the development of wadi-fed alluvial fans that reach directly the desert coast (e.g. narrow desert basin) leading to a variety of clastic and mixed carbonate facies. Due to prevailing arid conditions, vegetation is mainly restricted to highlands and water-conditioned lowland environments such as wadis, (tidal) coastal marshes and lagoons . Depending on sea influence and water availability, Cretaceous vegetation in Iberia were characterized by montane communities including arboreal/shrubby gymnosperms (mainly conifers) and lowland communities composed by a patchy mixture of ferns, Cupressaceae (cypress family), Cheirolepidiaceae and early angiosperms and/or costal woodlands incorporating Araucariaceae (monkey puzzle tree family). This distribution presents similarities with the ecosystems observed today in Eritrea mountains and other Holocene desert coasts. ]"

We focused specifically on evidence of multidisciplinary articles, in authorship or types of assessment parameters used. We sought to uncover: 1) where Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems are investigated, 2) how patterns in the disciplines of researchers have shifted over time, 3) how measured parameters differed among disciplines, and 4) which parameters were used most often.

However, the properties of CRS in Europe and North America tend to deteriorate. Coastal reclamation can cause soil pollution, eutrophication, and wetland degradation. Coastal reclamation will significantly increase soil GHG emissions. , Reclamation in coastal zones is effective for relieving population pressure and ensuring food safety. Since the 1950s, the development of coastal zones has entered a peak period. At present, the reclamation of coastal zones mainly occurs in developing countries. The coastal reclaimed lands are mainly used for agricultural production, urban and industrial development, and port construction. The scale and scope of reclamation in coastal lands are larger than in interior lands, and pose substantial environmental risks. This review summarizes the trends in soil physicochemical property evolution following reclamation in salt marshes from around the world. The following important conclusions were obtained: physicochemical properties of coastal saline soils (CSSs) significantly improved over the long term following reclamation in Eastern Asia. Long term fertilization and cultivation resulted in modified soil structure [an increase in the proportion of macroaggregates (&gt; 250 μm) and silt (0.002–0.05 mm)], enhancing the capacity for preserving fertility and C sequestration. Reclamation significantly increased soil organic matter (SOM), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) concentrations, and soil properties approached a relatively stable level nearly 30 years after reclamation, especially in Eastern Asia. However, in Europe and North America, SOM in coastal reclaimed soils (CRSs) decreased rapidly after reclamation, and soil acidification was also a severe problem during reclamation. Coastal reclamation could significantly increase soil GHG (CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O) emissions, further affecting global C cycle. Microbial biomass and activity as well as activities of related enzymes increased gradually in CRS in Eastern Asia, in particular the activities of urease and phosphatase involved in nutrient cycling. In general, physicochemical properties of CRS in Eastern Asia tend to modify, but deteriorate in Europe and North America. Nevertheless, offshore eutrophication , soil heavy metal and organic pollutant concentrations , and salt marsh ecosystem degradation were the most serious environmental risks posed by coastal reclamation. Some strategies to alleviate these risks are put forward. In this review, we also identified priority areas of future research on CRS. ]"

Mitigation measures hold the existing shoreline and keep safe of habitants and constructions. Soft engineering has priority to replace or assist traditional hard structures. , Hard engineered structures such as seawalls, groynes and breakwaters are often built to reduce coastal erosion and maintain a minimum beach width for recreation along coast regions. China has a seawall coastline of some 13 830 km that is the most popular erosion countermeasure along the Chinese coast; groynes and breakwaters always appear along muddy coasts or are used as aided structures. The latter are a common way to trap sediment in a particular coastal cell to maintain the nourished beach width; reclamation has already produced 12 000 km 2 of new land for the Chinese coastal area since the 1940's, including artificial islands in recent years. Soft engineering and combined structures are more and more popular in China; including those in Taiwan there are 34 documented nourishment sites. Other significant countermeasures to protect the coastline include planting Spartina alterniflora , mangrove afforestation , coral reef transplants, and introducing marine natural reserves. Since its introduction in the 1980's, over 34 km 2 of coastal wetland has been covered by Spartina alterniflora in China. Mangrove afforestation and coral reef transplants have also been carried out in the south China coastal area as environmentally friendly measures for coastal management, together with the declaration of marine natural reserves. More than 8 300 km 2 of coastal land has been protected in this way. Before the 1960's hard engineering works were mainly built on the Chinese coast, from then on soft engineering solutions became more common.

Starting by providing clarifications and definitions of the main terminology and key principles of ecological resilience theory, we pass on to expressing them through geomorphic dimensions of barrier islands. Three distinct environments (beach, dune, marsh) are proposed as the panarchical levels of analysis, along with potential feedbacks between them and geomorphic dimensions that can express the changes of the stability landscape. Morphological changes induced by storms and subsequent recovery are transferred to stability landscapes, over a range of storm impacts and recovery. We postulate that post-perturbation recovery should not be restricted to regaining pre-disturbance barrier dimensions, but should be viewed in terms of reorganisation and adaptation, accounting for maintaining the existence of functions, or the ability of the system to regain them. The proposed scheme and dimensions are tested using geomorphological data from barrier response to distinct disturbances, over different temporal scales that range from event to multi-decadal ones. The case of a barrier island migrating landwards is conceptualised in terms of alternative states and thresholds arising during the process and related phases and changes to the adaptive cycle.

With the aim to quantify the impacts of shipping emissions on urban air quality in coastal areas in Europe, an in depth literature review was carried out focussing on particulate matter and gaseous pollutants but also reviewing the main chemical tracers of shipping emissions, the particle size distribution of ship-derived particulates and their contributions to population exposure and atmospheric deposition . Mitigation strategies were also addressed. In European coastal areas, shipping emissions contribute with 1–7% of ambient air PM 10 levels, 1–14% of PM 2.5 , and at least 11% of PM 1 . Contributions from shipping to ambient NO 2 levels range between 7 and 24%, with the highest values being recorded in the Netherlands and Denmark. Impacts from shipping emissions on SO 2 concentrations were reported for Sweden and Spain. Shipping emissions impact not only the levels and composition of particulate and gaseous pollutants, but may also enhance new particle formation processes in urban areas. ]"

Notable differences in C org accumulation were observed within and among study sites. Highest accumulation in seagrasses, mangroves and salt marshes occurred after 1950s. Land use changes have enhanced C org burial rates and stock during the Anthropocene. 210 Pb dating is relevant for blue carbon stock evaluations in a global context , Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems provide important and multiple ecosystem services, including climate change mitigation through carbon storage. However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C org ) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove , seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using 210 Pb-dated sediment cores . Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C org stock (100 years) ) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C org ha −1 in mangroves, 8–53 Mg C org ha −1 in seagrasses and 32–56 Mg C org ha −1 in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8–426 g m −2 yr −1 , 2–252 g m −2 yr −1 and 1–60 g m −2 yr −1 , respectively. Most of the stored C org (60–86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900–1950), most likely as a result of land use changes . Increased C org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal . Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C org through significant CO 2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation. ]"

Their tidal inlets can only remain open over multiple centuries to millennia when (1) the formation of accommodation space exceeds infilling or (2) the inlet system is in dynamic equilibrium (i.e., sediment input equals output). Numerical modeling studies often suggest that estuaries and tidal embayments can develop toward a dynamic equilibrium under constant boundary conditions and consequently remain open over centuries to millennia, whereas in the Holocene sedimentary record many estuaries and tidal embayments are observed to have filled up and closed off. This raises the questions whether and how tidal inlets can remain open over long timescales (centuries to millennia), and what the effects are of river inflow and sediment supply. Here we compare the long-term evolution of contrasting tidal systems along the Dutch coastal plain to empirically identify the most important factors that control their long-term evolution. We study tidal systems along the Dutch coast because of (1) high data density, (2) abundant well-preserved and well-described estuaries and tidal embayments with contrasting boundary conditions and morphodynamic evolution and (3) their low-sloping setting with soft boundaries. This makes contrasting estuarine dimensions and development largely dependent on initial conditions, boundary conditions and internal biogeomorphological processes. In the Middle Holocene , Dutch estuaries and tidal embayments were mainly formed by rapid relative sea-level rise. In the late Holocene, they were predominantly the result of natural and human-induced subsidence in coastal plain peatlands. Tidal inlets connected to rivers (estuaries) persisted and attained dynamic large-scale equilibrium while tidal embayments without or with a marginal fluvial inflow were unstable and closed off under abundant sediment supply. Estuaries probably attained a quasi-stable configuration wherein sediment input equaled export due to river-enhanced ebb flow, until fluvial influx was cut off by upstream avulsion causing transition to an embayment and system closure. Long-term net import of sediment from the sea into Dutch tidal embayments is favored by strong, flood-dominated, tidal asymmetry along the Dutch coast, the shallow sand-rich floor of the North Sea, erosion of inherited coastal promontories, and the abundance of mud in the coastal area supplied by the Rhine and Meuse rivers. While sandy tidal embayments without fluvial feeders and with fixed boundaries may obtain dynamic equilibrium and remain open over long timescales, we hypothesize that an abundance of mud and eco-engineering species often culminates in continuous embayment filling with fine sediment and the growth of intertidal and supratidal areas, eventually resulting in closure of the embayment. ]"

Nowhere on the planet are blue carbon plants which carry out massive carbon extraction and permanent burial more intensely concentrated than in SE Asia. For the first time we make a national and total inventory of data to date for “blue carbon” buried from mangroves and seagrass and delineate the constraints. For an area across Southeast Asia of approximately 12,000,000 km 2 , supporting mangrove forests (5,116,032 ha) and seagrass meadows (6,744,529 ha), we analyzed the region's current blue carbon stocks. This estimate was achieved by integrating the sum of estuarine in situ carbon stock measurements with the extent of mangroves and seagrass across each nation, then summed for the region. We found that mangroves ecosystems regionally supported the greater amount of organic carbon (3095.19Tg C org in 1st meter) over that of seagrass (1683.97 Tg C org in 1st meter), with corresponding stock densities ranging from 15 to 2205 Mg ha −1 and 31.3 to 2450 Mg ha −1 respectively, a likely underestimate for entire carbon including sediment depths. The largest carbon stocks are found within Indonesia, followed by the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Tropical China, Viet-Nam, and Cambodia. Compared to the blue carbon hotspot of tropical/subtropical Gulf of Mexico's total carbon stock (480.48 Tg Corg), Southeast Asia's greater mangrove–seagrass stock density appears a more intense Blue Carbon hotspot (4778.66 Tg Corg). All regional Southeast Asian nation states should assist in superior preservation and habitat restoration plus similar measures in the USA &amp; Mexico for the Gulf of Mexico, as apparently these form two of the largest tropical carbon sinks within coastal waters. We hypothesize it is SE Asia's regionally unique oceanic–geologic conditions, placed squarely within the tropics, which are largely responsible for this blue carbon hotspot, that is, consistently high ambient light levels and year-long warm temperatures, together with consistently strong inflow of dissolved carbon dioxide and upwelling of nutrients across the shallow geological plates. ]"

Biotic and abiotic influences on fish nurseries highlighted. Differentiation of coastal nursery areas in terms of fish species utilization documented. Need for MPAs to include both marine and estuarine nursery areas emphasized. Global analysis of adjacent marine and estuarine fish nursery areas required. , A considerable amount of research has been undertaken to document and assess the nursery function of a variety of coastal habitats for marine fish species around the world. Most of these studies have focused on particular habitats and have generally been confined to a limited range of fish species associated with specific nursery areas. In this review we conduct a general assessment of the state of knowledge of coastal habitats in fulfilling the nursery-role concept for marine fishes, with particular emphasis on biotic and abiotic factors that influence nursery value. A primary aim was to synthesize information that can be used to drive sound conservation planning and provide a conceptual framework so that new marine protected areas (MPAs) incorporate the full range of nursery areas that are present within the coastal zone. We also use published data from a coastal section in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, to highlight the differential use of shallow aquatic habitats by a range of juvenile marine fish species within this region. Although the Eastern Cape case study does not assess the relative growth, food availability or predation in nursery and non-nursery areas within the coastal zone, it does document which habitats are important to the juveniles of dominant marine species within each area. These habitats, which range from intertidal pools, subtidal gulleys and surf zones to estuaries , do appear to perform a key role in the biological success of species assemblages, with the juveniles of particular marine fishes tending to favour specific nursery areas. According to a multivariate analysis of nursery habitat use within this region, marine species using estuaries tend to differ considerably from those using nearshore coastal waters, with a similar pattern likely to occur elsewhere in the world. ]"

A balance between environmental protection and economic development is essential. Focus on tangible pollutants that transcend borders is recommended, e.g., plastics. , The continuing threat of pollution on coastal and marine environment and resources has been addressed on regional scale over the past decades. This paper describes and compares the coastal and marine pollution management frameworks in the European and South East Asian regions. It highlights the differences and commonalities of the two regions in terms of the approach each has taken to address the transboundary pollution issues. It also focuses on the actions taken by France and the Philippines as parties to these regional management frameworks. A brief examination of the drivers and pressures on coastal and marine ecosystems as well as its current state showed that in both regions pollutants persist despite previous efforts to manage the release of pollutants from anthropogenic sources . The enactment of the Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive is the most recent response of the European Union (EU) to deal with persistent pollution issues in European waters. In South East Asia, management frameworks have also been developed through regional projects and programs supported by various international ( e.g. , UNEP) and regional institutions ( e.g. , ASEAN, PEMSEA). In both regions, the management frameworks take a holistic and functional management approach, although the EU member states have taken the action a step further by forging legally binding regional policies . Adopting a common and legally binding policy in SEA has been very difficult due to the varying geographical, political, social as well as economic settings of countries in this region. EU Member States like France have undertaken activities and actions in accordance with the requirements of the WFD and MSFD. On the other hand, the Philippines had been an active participant to the various regional projects and programs in SEA, though its compliance to the tasks and obligations of the regional conventions on coastal and marine pollution management had been limited due to other more pressing problems domestically. We conclude that despite the challenges encountered by EU Member States in complying with the EU Directives, there is a need for SEA to also move towards adopting and implementing a similar region-wide and legal framework for effective management of coastal and marine pollution issues. ]"

Perceived social costs and benefits of policies are determined by community social capital. Policies' public acceptability is a product of costs-benefits and community social capital. Social capital effects should be integrated into coastal management planning and implementation. , To develop public policies that respond to climate change demands examination of multiple physical and social variables. In the context of coastal zone management , these range from addressing prevailing environmental conditions, to accommodating the socio-economic needs of local communities and acknowledging the attitudes, norms and environmental behaviours of individuals. This paper focuses on these social aspects and develops an explanatory framework to model the effectiveness of coastal management policies based on the role of social capital. Although some studies have emphasised the positive influence of social capital on natural resources management , so far little research has been undertaken linking social capital as a multi-dimensional characteristic with the level of public receptiveness to policies seeking to mitigate risk at the coast. This paper analyzes the influence of three social capital elements on public responsiveness: social trust, institutional trust and social networks. The paper postulates that higher levels of social and institutional trust result in more positive community perceptions of proposed policies for coastal management. Similar reactions are expected in communities where dense social networks lead to higher levels of environmental awareness . The paper then identifies potential new areas of research that might address the current lack of consideration of non-economic social costs and benefits on public acceptability of coastal management policies. A principal claim made here is that higher levels of policy acceptability are generally evident in coastal communities with strong social capital, as such communities tend to perceive low social costs and high benefits arising from policy intervention. ]"

In this paper, we review the several mechanisms that interact and contribute to the development of coastlines on oceanic island volcanoes , and how these processes evolve throughout the islands' lifetime. Volcanic constructional processes dominate during the emergent island and subaerial shield-building stages. During the emergent island stage, surtseyan activity prevails and hydroclastic and pyroclastic structures form; these structures are generally ephemeral because they can be rapidly obliterated by marine erosion. With the onset of the subaerial shield-building stage, coastal evolution is essentially characterized by rapid but intermittent lateral growth through the formation of lava deltas, largely expanding the coastlines until they, typically, reach their maximum extension. With the post-shield quiescence in volcanic activity, destructive processes gradually take over and coastlines retreat, adopting a more prominent profile; mass wasting and marine and fluvial erosion reshape the landscape and, if conditions are favorable, biogenic processes assume a prominent role. Post-erosional volcanic activity may temporarily reverse the balance by renewing coastline expansion, but islands inexorably enter in a long battle for survival above sea level. Reef growth and/or uplift may also prolong the island's lifetime above the waves. The ultimate fate of most islands, however, is to be drowned through subsidence and/or truncation by marine erosion. ]"

Among the clasts transported are eighteen weighing more than 50 t, six of which exceed 100 t. The largest boulder moved during those storms weighs a fairly astonishing 620 t. The boulders moved in these recent storms provide pinning points for mapping storm-wave energies on coasts: their topographic positions mark elevations and distances inland reached by wave energies sufficient to dislocate those specific masses. Taken together, the CBD data reveal general relationships that shed light on storm-wave hydrodynamics. These include a robust correlation (inverse exponential) between maximum boulder mass transported and emplacement height above high water: the greater the elevation, the smaller the maximum boulder size, with a dependency exponent of about -0.2 times the elevation (in metres). There is a similar relationship, although with a much smaller rate-of-change (exponent -0.02), between boulder mass and distance inland, which holds from the shoreline in to about 120 m. Coastal steepness (calculated as the ratio of elevation to inland distance) seems to exert the strongest control, with an inverse power-law relationship between maximum boulder mass and slope ratio: the more gentle the topography, the larger the moved boulders. Quantifying CBD dynamics helps us understand the transmission of wave energies inshore during high-energy storm events. The transported boulders documented here are larger than many of those interpreted to have been moved by tsunami in other locations, which means that boulder size alone cannot be used as a criterion for distinguishing between tsunami and storm emplacement of CBD. The biggest blocks—up to 620 t—are new maxima for boulder mass transported by storm waves. We predict, however, that this record will not last long: the 2013–2014 storms were strong but not extreme, and there are larger boulders in these deposits that didn't move on this occasion. Bigger storms will surely move larger clasts, and clasts at greater distances from the shoreline. These measurements and relationships emphasise the extreme power of storm waves impacting exposed coastlines, and require us to rethink the upper limits of storm wave energy at coasts. ]"

Present challenges include overcoming the severe limitation of these algorithms in coastal waters and refining detection limits in various oceanic and coastal environments. To understand the spatio-temporal patterns of algal blooms and their triggering factors, it is essential to consider the possible effects of environmental parameters, such as water temperature, turbidity , solar radiation and bathymetry .

Ongoing and anticipated changes in the Louisiana coastal region promise to alter biogeochemical cycles including the net rate of denitrification by ecosystems. Projecting what these changes could mean for coastal water quality and natural resources requires an understanding of the magnitude and patterns of variation in denitrification rates and their connection to estuarine water quality at large temporal and spatial scales under current conditions. We compile and review denitrification rates reported in 32 studies conducted in a variety of habitats across coastal Louisiana during the period 1981– 2008. The acetylene inhibition and 15 N flux were the preferred techniques (95%); most of the studies used sediment slurries rather than intact sediment cores. There are no estimates of denitrification rates using the N 2 /Ar ratio and isotope pairing techniques, which address some of the problems and limitations of the acetylene inhibition and 15 N flux techniques. These studies have shown that sediments from estuaries, lakes, marshes, forested wetlands, and the coastal shelf region are capable of high potential denitrification rates when exposed to high NO 3 − concentrations (&gt; 100 µM).

The barnacle body is considered as good biomonitoring material and different barnacle species could bioaccumulate metal concentration ranges of 40–153,000 μg/g of Zn, 20–22,230 μg/g de Fe, 1.5–21,800 μg/g of Cu, 5.9–4742 μg/g of Mn, 0.1–1000 μg/g of Pb, 0.7–330 μg/g of Cd, 0.4–99 μg/g of Ni and 0.2–49 μg/g of Cr. However, as the plates (‘shells’) of barnacle exoskeletons can be affected by metal levels in coastal waters, mainly in their composition and morphology, they are not considered good biomonitoring material. Despite this, the use of a specific barnacle species or group of species in a specific region must firstly be carefully validated and the interpretation of the contaminant bioaccumulation levels should involve specific environmental variations of the region, physiological parameters of the barnacle species and the relationship between the potential toxicity of the contaminant for the environment and their significance for the barnacle species. Barnacles, particularly a widespread cosmopolitan species such as Amphibalanus amphitrite , have a great potential as biomonitors of anthropogenic contamination in coastal waters and have been used worldwide, including Europe (United Kingdom, Turkey, Poland, Croatia, Spain and Portugal), Asia (India and China), Oceania (Australia), North America (Florida, Massachusetts and Mexico) and South America (Brazil).

Notches are found from the Tropics to the Poles and in a wide range of rock types, virtually tideless to megatidal seas, and high to low wave energy environments. The emphasis in the literature has been on notches in calcareous rocks in warm, microtidal seas, and with the general assumption that they have been produced by bioerosion or chemical dissolution. Few scientifically rigorous attempts have been made to determine the processes responsible for notch formation in different environments and rock types, however, or to determine whether different processes produce distinct notch morphologies within the same tidal and wave environments. The use of notches as palaeo-sea level markers, and to determine rates of tectonic uplift, has been particularly important in the Mediterranean. Notches are more difficult to employ for this purpose in the middle latitudes, where higher waves and tides amplify the range of elevations over which the erosional mechanisms are effective, as well as increasing the exposure and effect of rocks of variable resistance to erosion. To maximize the utility of notches as sea level markers, and to better understand and model their development in a wide range of environments, we need to understand and be able to quantify the relationship between notch shape and size and the elevational efficacy of the various erosional processes . ]"

Armed with this information, we evaluate coastal response to variable sea-level rise of the Holocene and accelerated rise during historical time to gain a better understanding of how the coast is likely to respond to future changes. The early Holocene evolution of northwestern Gulf of Mexico bays was punctuated by rapid and possibly synchronous flooding events that are interpreted as resulting from episodes of rapid sea-level rise. Two of these events, one between ~ 8.4 and 8.0 ka and the other between ~ 7.4 and 6.8 ka, were associated with known episodes of ice sheet retreat in North America and Antarctica , respectively. During the middle and late Holocene, the east Texas and western Louisiana coasts experienced episodes of stability and growth followed by rapid shoreline retreat, while the central Texas coast remained relatively stable. This variability in coastal response to sea-level rise resulted mainly from differences in sediment supply and the highly irregular antecedent topography on which coastal environments formed. Sand that nourished the evolving east and south Texas, as well as westernmost Louisiana, coasts was derived mainly from transgressive ravinement of deltas that were formed during the falling stage of sea level (MIS5e–MIS2). The loci of these deltas controlled the spatial variability of this offshore sand supply. Sand supply to the central Texas coast has been dominated by converging longshore currents and throughout the middle to late Holocene was large enough to keep pace with sea-level rise. Moreover, sand supply from rivers has varied considerably in response to climate change. During the early Holocene, when the average rate of linear sea-level rise was 4.2 mm/yr, the Brazos, Colorado and Rio Grande Rivers all formed deltas on the inner continental shelf . Today, only the Brazos contributes enough sediment to the Gulf of Mexico to form a delta, but its sand delivery is minimal. A reversal from late Holocene growth of western Louisiana–east Texas and south Texas barrier islands and peninsulas to erosion occurred during the last ~ 2.0 ka, after the rate of sea-level rise began to decelerate. The actual timing of this reversal was diachronous across the coast and was caused by a decrease in sediment supply once offshore sand sources were bypassed by the landward-advancing shoreface (transgressive ravinement). Differences in the exact timing and rate of retreat also reflect variability in the offshore profiles of these barriers and their thickness, which results from the underlying relief on the Pleistocene surface. The late Holocene was also the time of chenier plain development in western Louisiana and east Texas that was marked by localized differences in growth and retreat. The current rate of eustatic sea-level rise in the northern Gulf of Mexico is in the range of 2.0 and 3.0 mm/yr and is approaching rates of the early Holocene. This is on average about five times the long-term rate of the past 4.0 ka. This larger rate is associated with an increase in coastal erosion in historical time relative to long-term rates. Current rates of Gulf shoreline erosion are approaching rates of the early to mid-Holocene and the rate of retreat of some barriers is not sustainable. Core transects off central Texas reflect a late Holocene history of shoreface progradation , but the modern shoreline is currently eroding, albeit at slower rates than elsewhere along the coast. Overall, the sand supply needed to sustain the Gulf shoreline is lacking. Likewise, baylines are experiencing erosion rates that are faster than the late Holocene average and bayhead deltas are at the tipping point of catastrophic retreat. Spatial variability in erosion rates highlights the importance of factors such as sediment supply, subsidence, and anthropogenic influences on coastal evolution. Tropical storms and hurricanes, while exerting the most noticeable coastal change, merely exacerbate overall shoreline retreat and migration. Along the entire northwestern Gulf Coast, the impact of human intervention to natural processes is particularly evident, primarily due to alterations in river discharge and sediment supply to the coast, interruptions in along-shore and cross-shore sand transport, and increases in rates of subsidence through fluid withdrawal. Compared to natural changes that took place during the Holocene, the impacts of human activity have been virtually instantaneous. The geological record indicates that the ongoing increase in the rate of sea-level rise, coupled with diminished sediment supply and human intervention, will continue to severely impact the low-gradient coastal environments of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. ]"

They are important components of the Late Yanshanian magmatic belt along the southeastern coast of China, and define a linear NNE–SSW-trending belt of magmatism . Geochronological, geochemical and geological data from thirty intrusions are summarised in this paper, and the data provide distinct magmatic, geochemical and tectonic patterns in the area. A compilation of geochronological data for these intrusive rocks indicates emplacement mainly from around 125 to 90 Ma, with a major peak from 115 to 90 Ma, and a subordinate peak from 125 to 115 Ma. Besides their temporal and spatial coexistence, all these intrusive rocks have similar geochemical patterns which point to involvement of components from a depleted asthenospheric mantle source for the parental magmas , most probably by magma mixing. The first appearance of sparse I-type granitoids with post-collisional extensional granite affinities, and the emplacement of the Baijuhuajian and Suzhou A-type granites, mark the beginning of extension during the Early Cretaceous at ca. 125 to 119 Ma. The subsequent development of bimodal magmatism at 115 to 90 Ma, with numerous arc-related mafic gabbros and I-type granites, together with some A-type granites, suggests that this major igneous event took place as a response to back-arc extension. On the basis of petrology , geochronology , tectonics, and elemental and isotopic geochemistry , we speculate that break-off and rollback of the subducting Palaeo-Pacific Plate during the Cretaceous were responsible for the Late Yanshanian regional tectono-magmatic evolution in the area. We suggest that this process facilitated a strong and rapid linear upwelling of the asthenospheric mantle beneath the coastal area of southeastern China, with consequential extension of the overlying continental lithosphere , and ultimately the large-scale Late Yanshanian magmatism of the study area. ]"

The port-city of Rome, which today lies 4 km from the coastline, was established in a very constrained environment at the mouth of the River Tiber. Based on a review of the geoarchaeological and archaeological research at Ostia, 4 new cores analysed through palaeoenvionmental methods, and 21 new radiocarbon dates, we propose a new model of the fluvio-coastal landscape of Ostia from its origin: (1) the coastline shifted rapidly westward between the 8th and the 6th c. BCE followed by a slow progradation and possible erosion phases until the end of the 1st c. CE; (2) the castrum of Ostia (c. late 4th–early 3rd c. BCE) was founded away from the river mouth but close to the River Tiber; (3) between the 4th and the 1st c. BCE, the River Tiber shifted from a position next to the castrum , below the northern Imperial cardo of Ostia, to 150 m to the north; (4) a possible harbour was established to the north of the castrum during the Republican period; (5) the city expanded and a district was built over the harbour and the palaeochannel between the Republican period and the beginning of the 2nd c. CE, showing that Ostia was a dynamic and resilient city during that time. Finally, we suggest the possibility to combine urban fabric analysis (the orientation of the structures) and palaeoenvironmental analysis for reconstructing the evolution of the city in relation to the fluvio-coastal mobility. ]"

We compiled a global synthesis of sea-level changes for the following highstands : MIS 1, MIS 3, MIS 5e and MIS 11. Also, we date the apparent onset of sequences of paleoshorelines either from published data or tentatively extrapolating an age for the uppermost, purported oldest shoreline in each sequence. Including the most documented MIS 5e benchmark, we identify 926 sequences out of which 185 also feature Holocene shorelines . Six areas are identified where elevations of the MIS 3 shorelines are known, and 31 feature elevation data for MIS 11 shorelines. Genetic relationships to regional geodynamics are further explored based on the elevations of the MIS 5e benchmark. Mean apparent uplift rates range from 0.01 ± 0.01 mm/yr (hotspots) to 1.47 ± 0.08 mm/yr (continental collision). Passive margins appear as ubiquitously uplifting, while tectonic segmentation is more important on active margins. From the literature and our extrapolations, we infer ages for the onset of formation for ~ 180 coastal sequences. Sea level fingerprinting on coastal sequences started at least during mid Miocene and locally as early as Eocene . Whether due to the changes in the bulk volume of seawater or to the temporal variations in the shape of ocean basins, estimates of eustasy fail to explain the magnitude of the apparent sea level drop. Thus, vertical ground motion is invoked, and we interpret the long-lasting development of those paleoshore sequences as the imprint of glacial cycles on globally uplifted margins in response to continental compression. The geomorphological expression of the sequences matches the amplitude and frequency of glacial cyclicity . From middle Pleistocene to present-day, moderately fast (100,000 yrs) oscillating sea levels favor the development of well identified strandlines that are distinct from one another. Pliocene and Lower Pleistocene strandlines associated with faster cyclicity (40,000 yrs) are more compact and easily merge into rasas, whereas older Cenozoic low-frequency eustatic changes generally led to widespread flat-lying coastal plains. ]"

As marshes are shrinking, scientific understanding of marsh expansion and erosion processes is growing. Coastal managers are also recognising the importance of marshes for flood protection, carbon sequestration , and pollutant filtering. Considerable effort is now being made to conserve saltmarshes. However, the rapid integration of science in policy remains an obstacle for ensuring successful conservation outcomes. This review explores how advances in the understanding of coastal dynamics, and the evolution of coastal management thinking, are shaping saltmarsh conservation policy in Great Britain. Saltmarsh management has shifted from reclamation, to protection, to restoration throughout the 20 th and 21 st centuries as calls for nature conservation grew and the importance of ecosystems in coastal erosion risk management became apparent. Studies have revealed that marshes cycle between expansion and erosion phases as part of their natural evolution, governed by processes acting across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Understanding which processes drive long-term marsh change provides an opportunity for coastal managers to undertake targeted intervention for positive conservation outcomes. The inherently dynamic nature of marshes also raises significant challenges in forecasting the long-term value provided by a given marsh. Challenges remain in the monitoring and management of sediment supply and transport, and the effective engagement with stakeholders during habitat protection and creation schemes, which are key to achieving marsh conservation goals. ]"

The latter became more and more important during the past few thousand years and particularly during the ‘Anthropocene’. However, although they are considered important in this respect as yet much less is known from tropical than from high latitude coasts. Tropical coasts receive the majority of river inputs into the ocean, they harbor a variety of diverse ecosystems and a majority of the population lives there and economically depends on their natural resources. This review delineates the biogeochemical response of coastal systems to environmental change and the interplay of natural and anthropogenic control factors nowadays and in the recent geological past with an emphasis on tropical regions. Weathering rates are higher in low than in high latitude regions with a maximum in the SE Asia/Western Pacific region. On a global scale the net effect of increasing erosion due to deforestation and sediment retention behind dams is a reduced sediment input into the oceans during the Anthropocene . However, an increase was observed in the SE Asia/Western Pacific region. Nitrogen and phosphorus inputs into the ocean have trebled between the 1970s and 1990s due to human activities. As a consequence of increased nutrient inputs and a change in the nutrient mix excessive algal blooms and changes in the phytoplankton community composition towards non-biomineralizing species have been observed in many regions. This has implications for foodwebs and biogeochemical cycles of coastal seas including the release of greenhouse gases. Examples from tropical coasts with high population density and extensive agriculture, however, display deviations from temperate and subtropical regions in this respect. According to instrumental records and observations the present-day biogeochemical and ecological response to environmental change appears to be on the order of decades. A sediment record from the Brazilian continental margin spanning the past 85,000 years, however, depicts that the ecosystem response to changes in climate and hydrology can be on the order of 1000–2000 years. The coastal ocean carbon cycle is very sensitive to Anthropocene changes in land-derived carbon and nutrient fluxes and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. As opposing trends in high latitude regions tropical coastal seas display increasing organic matter inputs and reduced calcification rates which have important implications for calcifying organisms and the carbon source or sink function of the coastal ocean. Particularly coral reefs which are thriving in warm tropical waters are suffering from ocean acidification . Nevertheless, they are not affected uniformly and the sensitivity to ocean acidification may vary largely among coral reefs. Therefore, the prediction of future scenarios requires an improved understanding of present and past responses to environmental change with particular emphasis put on tropical regions. ]"

The genesis of the siliciclastic-carbonate depositional pattern, typical of this East African region, is closely related both to the presence of a quartz-dominate Pleistocene riverine net—flooded during the Holocene sea level rise—and to the coeval development on the shallow shelf of a coral ecosystem producing vast skeletal sediments. The present facies pattern originates from the variable contribution in time and space of three sediment types: skeletal carbonate, quartz and palimpsest debris. The facies analysis allowed to distinguish 10 depositional facies and to differentiate them into three main types of substratum: soft bottom, reefal hard bottom and non-reefal hard bottom. These three types define both the loose facies typical of the channelized coastal belt and several facies of the shallow shelf. In the first, the amounts and textures of the stored sediment are strictly related to three major geomorphic types of substratum: sheltered mangal flat, shallow channel and deep channel. In the second and the third, a wide range of textures is related to coastal flats, benches, islets and emerging rocks. This modern facies pattern is implemented through a series of evolutionary phases: i—during the Last Interglacial Period, since isotope substage 5b, the shallow shelf—above −20 m—is permanently exposed for about 80 ka, with erosion, karstification and cuts of river channels through the shelf; ii—after the Last Glacial Maximum , when the sea level fell to about 110–115 m b.p.s.l. (below present sea level) at 18–17 ka BP, the sea level rose at −20 m for about 9 ka, flooding the shallow shelf area and gradually drowning the riverine net; iii—the maximum flooding of the coastal belt was reached at about 4.5 ka BP, when a gradual moisture reduction caused a decrease of siliciclastic sediment supply; iv—a fairly rapid fall of sea levels since about 4.5 ka BP was probably accompanied by a decline in drought, producing relatively high siliciclastic loose sediment remobilization that carved the morphological steps of the coastal flat, leading to the regression of the coral reef community, and the formation of rhodolith beds. The investigated depositional system is then correlated with the model of a distally steepened ramp with mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentation, suitable for the present setting of the Kenyan coast. ]"

Insights on applications of different satellite products are discussed. Future directions towards advancing satellite water quality research are proposed. , Recent and forthcoming launches of a plethora of ocean color radiometry sensors, coupled with increasingly adopted free and open data policies are expected to boost usage of satellite ocean color data and drive the demand to use these data in a quantitative and routine manner. Here we review factors that introduce uncertainties to various satellite-derived water quality products and recommend approaches to minimize the uncertainty of a specific product. We show that the regression relationships between remote-sensing reflectance and water turbidity (in terms of nephelometric units) established for different regions tend to converge and therefore it is plausible to develop a global satellite water turbidity product derived using a single algorithm. In contrast, solutions to derive suspended particulate matter concentration are much less generalizable; in one case it might be more accurate to estimate this parameter based on satellite-derived particulate backscattering coefficient, whereas in another the nonagal particulate absorption coefficient might be a better proxy. Regarding satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration, known to be subject to large uncertainties in coastal waters, studies summarized here clearly indicate that the accuracy of classical reflectance band-ratio algorithms depends largely on the contribution of phytoplankton to total light absorption coefficient as well as the degree of correlation between phytoplankton and the dominant nonalgal contributions. Our review also indicates that currently available satellite-derived water quality products are restricted to optically significant materials, whereas many users are interested in toxins, nutrients, pollutants, and pathogens. Presently, proxies or indicators for these constituents are inconsistently (and often incorrectly) developed and applied. Progress in this general direction will remain slow unless, (i) optical oceanographers and environmental scientists start collaborating more closely and make optical and environmental measurements in parallel, (ii) more efforts are devoted to identifying optical, ecological, and environmental forerunners of autochthonous water quality issues (e.g., onsite growth of pathogens), and, (iii) environmental processes associated with the source, transport, and transformation of allochthonous issues (e.g., transport of nutrients) are better understood. Accompanying these challenges, the need still exists to conduct fundamental research in satellite ocean color radiometry, including development of more robust atmospheric correction methods as well as inverse models for coastal regions where optical properties of both aerosols and hydrosols are complex. ]"

This review highlights the main advances in luminescence geochronology of interglacial coastal sediments through the analysis of 547 luminescence ages, most of which were published during the last decade. The majority of these reported luminescence investigations have been carried out along passive margin coasts. Since the turn of the century, the discovery of a normalization procedure known as Single Aliquot Regeneration (SAR) has drastically reduced data scatter and improved precision, with the consequence that quartz SAR optically-stimulated luminescence OSL has become the dating protocol of choice for the Last Interglacial (LIG) period. A more complex technique, known as thermally-transferred OSL (TT-OSL), is presumably proposed for dating older interglacials of the Mid-Pleistocene and beyond. Feldspar luminescence is increasingly being applied to dating Pleistocene sea level high stands due to a much higher dose saturation level than quartz OSL. The use of feldspar IRSL (Infrared-stimulated luminescence) is limited by the occurrence of variable, but ubiquitous anomalous fading (AF). Following the advent of AF-correction methods, several Middle Pleistocene sites have been amenable to dating, albeit with significant related uncertainties. Recently, new protocols involving the measurement of post-IR IRSL at elevated temperatures have yielded relatively coherent ages for interglacial sediments up to ca. 300 ka. Quartz OSL/TT-OSL, AF-corrected IRSL, and post-IR IRSL ages are generally correlated with periods of sea level high stands. A few ages are reported from the early and middle part of the Middle Pleistocene, as MIS11, 9 and more commonly MIS7 high stands are documented in strongly uplifting active margin coasts. However, by far the most obvious age peak corresponds to the end of the LIG. The MIS5e shoreline is probably the most studied and luminescence-dated coastal feature of all, as the chronology of the sea level markers is crucial to assess global eustatic sea level variations through the course of the last interglacial. Nevertheless, the observed abundance of young (100–120 ka) luminescence ages for presumed MIS5e sediments may underline methodological issues, and/or reflect the higher preservation potential of late regressive sequences. On the other hand, the occurrence of geographically distant reports of MIS5a high stand might reflect a true eustatic origin for this event. Age analysis supports the impression of general reliability of luminescence for the timing of former sea level high stands. There is a clear need to address issues in dose rate variability, in the phenomenology of fading in feldspar, and in the behaviour of luminescence growth with dose, both in laboratory and natural conditions. These could be addressed and properly evaluated by dating different minerals, as multiple or single grains, with consequent variable internal dose rates. More robust practices in the application of luminescence dating techniques could eventually constrain the age uncertainties to no better than 2–3%. Therefore, the strength of luminescence as a dating tool is more in terms of its extended age range and the ubiquity of datable material. ]"

Unresolved dynamics and remaining problems of field observations and numerical simulations are reviewed on the basis of the approach that modern process-oriented studies should be based on both observations and models. First of all, the basic dynamics of surface and bottom boundary layers as well as intermediate stratified regimes including the interaction of turbulence and internal waves are briefly discussed. Then, an overview is given on just established or recently emerging mechanical, acoustic and optical observational techniques. Microstructure shear probes although developed already in the 1970s have only recently become reliable commercial products. Specifically under surface waves turbulence measurements are difficult due to the necessary decomposition of waves and turbulence. The methods to apply Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) for estimations of Reynolds stresses, turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation rates are under further development. Finally, applications of well-established turbulence resolving particle image velocimetry (PIV) to the dynamics of the bottom boundary layer are presented. As counterpart to the field methods the state-of-the-art in numerical modeling in coastal seas is presented. This includes the application of the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method to shallow water Langmuir Circulation (LC) and to stratified flow over a topographic obstacle. Furthermore, statistical turbulence closure methods as well as empirical turbulence parameterizations and their applicability to coastal ocean turbulence and mixing are discussed. Specific problems related to the combined wave–current bottom boundary layer are discussed. Finally, two coastal modeling sensitivity studies are presented as applications, a two-dimensional study of upwelling and downwelling and a three-dimensional study for a marginal sea scenario (Baltic Sea).

On east-facing coasts south of the Humber estuary and north-facing Norfolk, water levels were higher than in the twentieth century benchmark surge event of 31 January–1 February 1953. Maximum significant wave heights were highest off the North Norfolk coast (peak H s = 3.8 m offshore, 2.9 m inshore) and lowest off the Suffolk coast (H s = 1.5–1.8 m inshore); comparable offshore wave heights in 1953 were 7–8 m and ca. 3 m. The lower wave heights, and their short duration, in 2013 explain both localised breaching, overtopping, and back-barrier flooding associated with gravel ridges and relatively low earthen banks as well as the lack of failure in more highly-engineered coastal defences. On barrier coasts and within estuaries, the signal of maximum runup was highly variable, reflecting the modification of the tide–surge–wave signal by inshore bathymetry and the presence of a range of coastal ecosystems . The landscape impacts of the December 2013 surge included the notching of soft rock cliffs and cliffline retreat; erosion of coastal dunes ; and the augmentation or re-activation of barrier island washover deposits. Whilst surge event-related cliff retreat on the rapidly eroding cliffs of the Suffolk coast lay within the natural variability in inter-annual rates of retreat, the impact of the surge on upper beach/sand dune margins produced a pulse of shoreline translation landwards equivalent to about 10 years of ‘normal’ shoreline retreat. The study of east coast surges over the last 60 years, and the identification of significant phases of landscape change — such as periods of rapid soft rock cliff retreat and the formation of new gravel washovers on barrier islands — points to the importance of high water levels being accompanied by high wave activity. Future developments in early warning systems and evacuation planning require information on the variable impacts of such extreme events. ]"

Salt marshes are generally able to withstand violent storms without collapsing. Importance of indirect long term impact of storms rather than of sole after-storm periods. , This manuscript reviews the progresses made in the understanding of the dynamic interactions between coastal storms and salt marshes, including the dissipation of extreme water levels and wind waves across marsh surfaces, the geomorphic impact of storms on salt marshes, the preservation of hurricanes signals and deposits into the sedimentary records, and the importance of storms for the long term survival of salt marshes to sea level rise . A review of weaknesses, and strengths of coastal defences incorporating the use of salt marshes including natural, and hybrid infrastructures in comparison to standard built solutions is then presented. Salt marshes are effective in dissipating wave energy, and storm surges, especially when the marsh is highly elevated, and continuous. This buffering action reduces for storms lasting more than one day. Storm surge attenuation rates range from 1.7 to 25 cm/km depending on marsh and storms characteristics. In terms of vegetation properties, the more flexible stems tend to flatten during powerful storms, and to dissipate less energy but they are also more resilient to structural damage, and their flattening helps to protect the marsh surface from erosion, while stiff plants tend to break, and could increase the turbulence level and the scour. From a morphological point of view, salt marshes are generally able to withstand violent storms without collapsing, and violent storms are responsible for only a small portion of the long term marsh erosion. Our considerations highlight the necessity to focus on the indirect long term impact that large storms exerts on the whole marsh complex rather than on sole after-storm periods. The morphological consequences of storms, even if not dramatic, might in fact influence the response of the system to normal weather conditions during following inter-storm periods. For instance, storms can cause tidal flats deepening which in turn promotes wave energy propagation, and exerts a long term detrimental effect for marsh boundaries even during calm weather. On the other hand, when a violent storm causes substantial erosion but sediments are redistributed across nearby areas, the long term impact might not be as severe as if sediments were permanently lost from the system, and the salt marsh could easily recover to the initial state. ]"

Geological structure controls the spatial extent of the saltwater wedge. Hydrodynamic properties control the propagation of the saltwater wedge. Saltwater wedge position depends on competition between recharge and tidal amplitude. , Spatial and temporal changes in saltwater wedges in coastal karst aquifers are still poorly understood, largely due to complex mixing processes in these heterogeneous environments, but also due to anthropogenic forcing such as pumping, which commonly affect natural variations in wedges. The purpose of this study was first to characterize the hydrodynamic functioning of a karst aquifer in an oceanic temperate climate with little anthropogenic pressure but strongly influenced by a high tidal range and second, to evaluate the extent and movements of a saltwater wedge influenced by both the tide and the natural recharge of the aquifer. Variations in specific conductivity combined with water chemistry results from six boreholes and two lakes located in the Bell Harbour catchment (western Ireland) enabled us to assess the extent of the intrusion of the saltwater wedge into the aquifer as a function of both karst recharge and tidal movements at high/low and neap/spring tidal cycles. The marked spatial disparity of the saltwater wedge was analysed as a function of both the hydrodynamic and the structural properties of the karst aquifer. Results showed that the extent of the saltwater wedge depended not only on the intrinsic properties of the aquifer but also on the relative influence of the recharge and the tide on groundwater levels, which have opposite effects. Recharge in the Burren area throughout the year is large enough to prevent saltwater intruding more than about one kilometre from the shore. A strong tidal amplitude seems to be the motor of sudden saltwater intrusion observed in the aquifer near the shore while the position of the groundwater level seems to influence the intensity of the salinity increase. Competition between recharge and the tide thus controls the seawater inputs, hence explaining temporal and spatial changes in the saltwater wedge in this coastal karst aquifer. ]"

Initial barrier form significantly influences barrier behaviour; measurement of barrier morphology is essential for any study. Future research should focus on incorporating important geological influences into modelling efforts. Coastal management must acknowledge the qualitative nature of assessments of future change. , Barrier/lagoon systems occupy a significant part of the world's coast. They are diverse in size, morphology, geological and oceanographic setting, and morphodynamic behaviour. Understanding the behaviour of barriers at 10 1 to 10 2 year and 10 1 to 10 2 km scales (mesoscale) is an important scientific and societal goal, not least because of the preponderance of intensive coastal development in a time of global climate change. Such understanding presents significant challenges. Challenges in describing mesoscale system behaviour relate largely to the incomplete evidence base of (i) morphological change in system components, (ii) dynamic and internal forcing factors (drivers) and (iii) geological constraints. These shortcomings curtail the development of baseline datasets against which to test models. Understanding observed changes and thereby predicting future behavioural patterns demands assumptions and simplifications regarding the linkages between initial state, dynamic drivers, system feedbacks and a multiplicity of geological constraints that are often location-specific. The record of mesoscale change is improving with the acquisition of long-term morphological datasets. Advances in technology and chronological control mean that geological investigations can now provide decadal to century-scale temporal resolution of morphological change. In addition, exploratory modelling is improving understanding of the influence of various dynamic and geological factors. Straightforward linking of dynamic forcing and response is seldom able to account for observed mesoscale behaviour. Geological factors exert a significant or even dominant control on barrier behaviour at decadal to century timescales. Whereas these geological controls can be quantified to some extent by detailed investigations of contemporary barrier/lagoon morphology and constituent materials, underlying geology and topography and sediment supply, in all but a few locations, such data are absent. This sets an unavoidable constraint on efforts to quantitatively predict the future behaviour of barrier systems, which are strongly site-specific in terms of their geological setting and morphology. Geological controls exist in a network of interactions that individually and collectively influence mesoscale barrier behaviour. Dominant, first-order controls are: Basement slope; Basement irregularity and erodibility ; External sediment supply; Orientation; and Shoreline lithification (beachrock and aeolianite) An important intermediate level of geological control is exerted by shoreface morphology. Shorefaces are themselves influenced by underlying geological factors, but they are dynamic at longer timescales than barriers. Geological influences are in most cases unquantified and are usually disregarded when conceptualizing and modelling barrier evolution. Consideration of the geological influences is, however, essential in efforts to predict future behaviour at mesoscale (management) timescales. ]"

In the United States, this province covers the Atlantic Coastal Plain and a substantial portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Heavy minerals were first mined from surface and near-surface sands of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in 1916, when Buckman and Pritchard opened a mine on a beach near Mineral City, Florida, to recover ilmenite . Numerous heavy-mineral deposits have since been identified within the surface sands of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains. Although some of the deposits are now being mined, others are no longer active, or have been lost to mining because of cultural developments. Some are likely to be mined in the future. Significant heavy-mineral deposits have been or are being exploited in New Jersey, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Some important heavy-mineral deposits formed in beach ridges at the height of major marine transgressions, e.g., the Trail Ridge and Highland (Maxville) deposits along Trail Ridge, and the Yulee, Cabin Bluff, Altama, Aurora, and Chowan deposits along the Pamlico shoreline . Other deposits developed in beach ridges formed at times of temporary halts or during minor transgressions in periods of general regression, e.g., the Green Cove Springs, Boulougne, Folkston, and Lulaton deposits. Those formed in alluvial environments include Manchester, Lakehurst, and Camden, as well as those of the Virginia and North Carolina Fall Zone. The most significant heavy-mineral deposits of the onshore Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains, as far west as the Louisiana–Texas border, are reviewed. ]"

Sedimentary basins and delta heads, and delta lobes were active since the formation of the Gondwana. Model of inheritance and continuum of Gondwanan structural trends. , The Indian subcontinent comprises accreted cratonic fragments that underwent subsequent rifting–subduction–collision processes along major mobile belts. It is also a storehouse of a prolonged history of crustal evolution involving repeated episodes of magmatism , volcanism , sedimentation, and metamorphism , and the formation of intracratonic and foreland basins . The geologic–geomorphic evolution of the Peninsula is recorded in relic faults/suture zones that confine Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic sedimentary basins and landforms . In addition, escarpments , plateaus, waterfalls , deltas, planation surfaces, and strandlines are either aligned parallel and/or formed over them. Asymmetric relief across the western–eastern parts of the Peninsula, orographic effect on the precipitation pattern and climatic zones provide important constrains on the geologic and geomorphic evolution of the region. Though extensive continental and coastal deposition occurred during Permo-Triassic and Early Cretaceous , only the downwarped grabens of Gondwana basins preserved the sedimentary records. Occurrences of extensive Cenozoic deposits offshore and Neogene–Holocene deltaic deposits along the entire east coast as opposed to the absence of comparable deltaic sequences in the west coast are linked to intense and recurrent episodes of denudation indicating first-order control of basement structures over landscape evolution . Inheritance and continuum of basement structures over climate, and landscape evolution of Peninsular India can also be witnessed by the unique and diverse drainage patterns of major rivers. While most of the major rivers follow a general easterly direction, the landscape morphology of their catchments indicates youthful character and tectonically active nature. The east flowing rivers show an asymmetry between the areal extents of drainage basin size and delta, whereas the west-flowing rivers are short and straight and their catchments are miniscule in comparison with the rivers flowing toward east. The Western Ghats Escarpment forms an orographic barrier and acts as the main divide between these two drainage systems. There is a disparity between the quanta of sediment discharge as well. In addition, the eastern and western parts of India, across the Western Ghats Escarpment, show significant differences in terms of climatic zones (humid to per-humid on the west while it is arid to subhumid on the east). The west coast is characterized by &gt; 3000 mm/year annual rainfall, that often reaches &gt; 5000 mm/year, dominance of SW monsoon winds, occurrence of narrow (&lt; 60 km), rocky, crenulated and coastal cliffs and pocket beaches, and net southerly long shore sediment transport . In contrast, the east coast is characterized by several hundred kilometers wide deltaic low lands built by major rivers. These rivers show trellis to dendritic stream patterns and follow major basement faults that are associated with geologic–historic–recent seismic activity. The sedimentary basins and delta heads, strandlines, and active delta lobes whose western boundary is always limited by basement faults have shown activity since the formation of the Gondwanan supercontinent . The eastern coastal region is also different from the west in terms of active NE monsoon, long shore sediment transport (toward north), and the formation of extensive lagoon-beach barrier systems since Neogene that in turn continue to occur until recent. Here we propose a conceptual tectono-geomorphic model demonstrating the inheritance and continuum of Gondwanan structural trends on the transient landscape of Peninsular India. ]"

Knowledge of the ecology of these systems is important for their preservation. The area investigated in this study is located in the town of Ladispoli, in the province of Rome. In June 1995, the Palo Laziale wood was identified as a Site of Community Importance according to the European Commission Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). This habitat has been drastically reduced due to the expansion of agricultural activities and urbanisation. Both chemical and isotope data provide important information for understanding the processes that determine the variation in chemical composition within a coastal wetland system. The spatial and temporal variation in chemical composition and the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope composition of the individual water bodies within the system were measured over an annual cycle. We also compared geochemical data from 2010 with data collected during April 2002. The results of the geochemical analysis suggest that the waters are brackish (TDS &gt; 1000 mg/l), but these results exclude seawater intrusion as a possible cause of the deterioration of the wetland ecosystem. Based on a comparison of the data from 2010 and 2002, the system appears to have been resilient, successfully buffering the changes without substantial alterations in its functioning. Our investigation shows that geochemical research is necessary to understand the modifications affecting wetland ecosystems and the role of human-induced changes. The monitoring data for the water resource in the Palo Laziale area provided evidence that slight changes have occurred over an eight-year period. ]"

The first observations of the fetch effect go back 70 years and the concept has been widely used in a variety of landscapes. This paper reviews the present state of knowledge of the fetch effect, with particular reference to its application in coastal areas, and compares findings from theoretical, wind tunnel, and fieldwork experiments. While wind tunnel experiments tend to show critical fetch distances of a few metres, studies in natural areas show that measured critical fetch distance can exceed one hundred metres. There is supporting evidence pointing to the role of soil clods/crusts and moisture content in increasing critical fetch distances in agricultural and coastal areas, respectively. In coastal areas tradeoffs imposed by the geometry of the beach over which the wind is blowing and wind direction determine the available fetch distance and thus the sediment transport rate downwind. A major challenge which needs to be addressed is the development of robust equations for predicting both the critical fetch length and the increase in the sediment transport rate with distance on beaches. There is also a need to obtain field data on the combined effect of moisture, angle of wind approach, beach width, and fetch length. Long-term monitoring using remote sensing techniques may provide valuable data to analyze the effect of fetch distances on the nature of transport events that deliver sediment from the beach to the foredune. ]"

Here we review published geologic maps and compare them to paleoshoreline locations obtained through geomorphometric classification and satellite data. We furthermore present the results of an extensive field campaign that measured the mid-Pliocene (~ 3.3–2.9 Ma) shorelines of the Atlantic Coastal Plain using high-accuracy GPS and digital elevation models . We compare our new dataset to positions and elevations extracted from published maps and find that the extracted site information from earlier studies is prone to significant error, both in the location and, more severely, in the elevation of the paleoshoreline. We also investigate, using geophysical modeling, the origin of post-depositional displacement of the shoreline from Georgia to Virginia. In particular, we correct the elevation of our shoreline for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and then compare the corrected elevation to predictions of mantle flow-induced dynamic topography (DT). While a subset of these models does reconcile the general trends in the observed elevation of the mid-Pliocene shoreline, local discrepancies persist. These discrepancies suggests that either (i) the DT and GIA models presented here do not capture the full range of uncertainty in the input parameters; and/or (ii) other influences, such as sediment loading and unloading or local fault-driven tectonics, may have contributed to post-depositional deformation of the mid-Pliocene shoreline that are not captured in the above models. In this context, our field measurements represent an important observational dataset with which to compare future generations of geodynamic models. Improvements in models for DT, GIA and other relevant processes, together with an expanded, geographically distributed set of shoreline records, will ultimately be the key to obtaining more accurate estimates of eustatic sea level not only in the mid-Pliocene but also earlier in the Cenozoic. ]"

Nearly all East Antarctic records show a near-synchronous Early Holocene climate optimum (11.5–9 ka BP), coinciding with the deglaciation of currently ice-free regions and the optimum recorded in Antarctic ice and marine sediment cores. Shallow marine and coastal terrestrial climate anomalies appear to be out of phase after the Early Holocene warm period, and show complex regional patterns, but an overall trend of cooling in the terrestrial records. A Mid to Late Holocene warm period is present in many East Antarctic lake and shallow coastal marine records. Although there are some differences in the regional timing of this warm period, it typically occurs somewhere between 4.7 and 1 ka BP, which overlaps with a similar optimum found in Antarctic Peninsula terrestrial records. The differences in the timing of these sometimes abrupt warm events in different records and regions points to a number of mechanisms that we have yet to identify. Nearly all records show a neoglacial cooling from 2 ka BP onwards. There is no evidence along the East Antarctic coastline for an equivalent to the Northern Hemisphere Medieval Warm Period and there is only weak circumstantial evidence in a few places for a cool event crudely equivalent in time to the Northern Hemisphere's Little Ice Age. There is a need for well-dated, high resolution climate records in coastal East Antarctica and particularly in Terre Adélie, Dronning Maud Land and Enderby Land to fully understand the regional climate anomalies, the disparity between marine and terrestrial records, and to determine the significance of the heterogeneous temperature trends being measured in the Antarctic today. ]"

A suggested list of criteria has been prepared for future researchers to increase the quantity and quality of the data. , Human activities such as seashore reclamation can have profound negative impacts on the macrobenthos of coastal wetlands. Using the Yellow River Delta as a case study, we conducted a thorough search of the literature to create a synthesis about the effects of reclamation processes. We found 31 publications that met our selection criteria, and we summarized their data to systematically quantify the impacts of reclamation on the dominant species, biomass, abundance, and biodiversity indices. We found that the dominant species changed remarkably, from Mollusca in the 1980s to Polychaeta, Crustacea, and Insecta (indicating a transition from a marine to a terrestrial environment) after 2000.

Tsunami hazard assessment requires information on long-term patterns of frequency and magnitude, which are best explained by inverse power-law functions. In areas with a short historical documentation, long-term patterns must therefore be based on geological traces. The Caribbean tsunami hazard is exemplified by &gt; 80 events triggered by earthquakes, volcanic activity, or mass wasting within the region or in the far-field during the last 520 years. Most of these tsunamis had regional or local impacts. Based on two numerical hydrodynamic models of tsunamis spawning at the Muertos Thrust Belt (MTB) and the South Caribbean Deformed Belt (SCBD), which are two scenarios only marginally considered so far, we show that pan-Caribbean tsunamis can also be taken into account. We furthermore review almost 60 sites for possible geological evidence of tsunamis in the Caribbean including fine-grained subsurface deposits and subaerial coarse clasts , and re-evaluate their implications for tsunami hazard assessment against state-of-the-art models of onshore sediment deposition by tsunamis and extreme storms. The records span the mid- to late Holocene , with very few exceptions of Pleistocene age. Only a limited number of reliable palaeotsunami records with consistent and robust age control were identified, hampering inter-island or interregional correlation of deposits of the same event. Distinguishing between storm and tsunami transport of solitary boulders is very difficult in most cases, whereas those clasts arranged as ridges or incorporated into polymodal ridge complexes, which line many windward coasts of the Caribbean, can mainly be attributed to long-term formation during strong storms, overprinting potential tsunami signatures. The quantification of tsunami flooding parameters such as flow depth, inundation distance or flow velocities, by applying inverse and forward numerical models of sediment transport is still very limited and needs to be extended in the future. Likewise, sediment-derived hazard implications still await implementation in spatial planning. As extreme-wave deposits are clearly understudied in the Caribbean, there is great potential for coastal hazard assessment to be developed and improved. Thus, further studies using common standards of high-resolution methods of bedform and stratigraphical documentation and robust chronological models with independent age control, combined with refined inverse and forward models of sediment transport and deposition are required to reconstruct reliable patterns of magnitude and frequency of palaeotsunamis in the Caribbean and to map hazard-prone areas. To date, known palaeotsunami deposits from the Caribbean probably represent only a fraction of actually happened prehistoric tsunamis and, therefore, do not reflect major tsunami inundations of the past adequately. ]"

Because MeHg represents a potent neurotoxin that may magnify in marine foodwebs, it is important to understand the mechanisms and environmental variables that drive or constrain methylation dynamics in these environments. This critical review article explores the mechanisms hypothesized to influence aqueous phase and sediment solid phase MeHg concentrations and depth-specific inorganic Hg (II) (Hg i ) methylation rates (MMR) within estuarine and coastal marine environments, and discusses issues of terminology or methodology that complicate mechanism-oriented interpretation of field and laboratory data. Mechanisms discussed in this review article include: 1) the metabolic activity of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), the microbial group thought to dominate mercury methylation in these environments; 2) the role that Hg i concentration and/or speciation play in defining depth-specific Hg i methylation rates; and 3) the depth-dependent balance between MeHg production and consumption within the sedimentary environment . As discussed in this critical review article, the hypothesis of SRB community control on the Hg i methylation rate in estuarine and coastal marine environments is broadly supported by the literature. Although Hg i speciation, as a function of porewater inorganic sulfide and/or dissolved organic matter concentration and/or pH, may also play a role in observed variations in MMR, the nature and function of the controlling ligand(s) has not yet been adequately defined. Furthermore, although it is generally recognized that the processes responsible for MeHg production and consumption overlap spatially and/or kinetically in the sedimentary environment, and likely dictate the extent to which MeHg accumulates in the aqueous and/or sediment solid phase, this conceptual interpretation requires refinement, and would benefit greatly from the application of kinetic modeling. ]"

The Rauenberg locality (Baden-Württemberg, Germany) is one of the most significant early Oligocene fossil assemblages in Europe, containing both marine and terrestrial elements of fauna and flora. Preservation is often superb and comprises complete and articulated skeletons with soft tissue preservation . The diverse assemblage provides critical insights into the paleoenvironment of the Upper Rhine Valley.

In particular we focus on harmful algal blooms , seaweeds , eelgrass , mangroves , salt marsh plants , foraminiferans, stromatolites, corals, squid , zooplankton, zoobenthos , fish, birds, crocodiles and hippopotamus, but also refer to biota such as pathogens, coralline algae , jellyfish and otters. The role of pioneers or propagules as indicators of an incipient range expansion are discussed, with mangroves, zoobenthos, fishes and birds providing the best examples of actual and imminent distributional changes. The contraction of the warm temperate biogeographic region, arising from the intrusion of cool upwelled waters along the Western Cape shores, and increasingly warm Agulhas Current waters penetrating along the eastern parts of the subcontinent, are highlighted.

It shows that these can be divided into four categories: natural recovery from a natural or anthropogenic change (whether adverse or otherwise); anthropogenic interventions in response to a degraded or anthropogenically changed environment; anthropogenic responses to a single stressor; and habitat enhancement or creation. A conceptual framework for restoration and recovery of marine marginal and semi-enclosed areas is presented after exploring and refining the plethora of terms used in restoration science and management. Examples of management action are given including managed realignment and the restoration of docks, biogenic reefs, saltmarsh, seagrass, beaches and upper estuarine water quality. We emphasise that although recovery techniques are worthwhile if they can be carried out, they rarely (if ever) fully replace lost habitat. Moreover, while they may have some success in marginal or semi-enclosed areas such as coastal bays, estuaries and fringing habitats, they are less relevant to open coastal and marine habitats. Therefore the best option available in the latter can only be to remove the stressor, as the cause of any change, to prevent other stressors from operating and to allow the conditions suitable for natural recovery. This review emphasises that whereas some ecological concepts related to restoration are well understood, for example, the nature of ecosystem structure and functioning, others such as carrying capacity, resilience and ecosystem goods and services are still poorly quantified for the marine and estuarine environments. The linking between these ecological concepts and the management framework is also relatively recent but is required to give a holistic approach to understanding, managing and manipulating these environments. ]"

In this paper, we reviewed the drivers of porewater and groundwater advection in permeable shelf sediments in an attempt to bridge gaps among different disciplines studying similar problems. We identified the following driving forces: (1) terrestrial hydraulic gradients, (2) seasonal changes in the aquifer level on land moving the location of the subterranean estuary, (3) wave setup and tidal pumping, (4) water level differences across permeable barriers, (5) flow- and topography-induced pressure gradients, (6) wave pumping; (7) ripple and other bed form migration, (8) fluid shear, (9) density-driven convection, (10) bioirrigation and bioturbation, (11) gas bubble upwelling, and (12) sediment compaction. While these drivers occur over spatial scales ranging from mm to km, and temporal scales ranging from seconds to years, their ultimate biogeochemical implications are very similar (i.e., they are often a source of new or recycled nutrients to seawater and transform organic carbon into inorganic carbon). Drivers 2–12 result in no net water input into the ocean. Taking all these mechanisms into account, we conservatively estimate that a volume equivalent to that of the entire ocean is filtered by permeable sediments at time scales of about 3000 years. Quantifying the relative contribution of these drivers is essential to understand the contribution of sediments to the global cycles of matter. ]"

The shear (S)-wave velocity of near surface materials (such as soil, rocks and pavement) and its effect on seismic wave propagation are of fundamental interest in many groundwater, engineering and environmental studies. Geologically, the study area comprises of Precambrian basement over which younger rocks commencing with Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary and Quaternary have given rise to varying sequences in different parts. The study has been conducted along the lineaments and these were selected based on the analysis of IRS-1D LISS-IV satellite images and the field geological investigation. The average shear wave velocity, stiffness and the liquefaction potential were evaluated by using the obtained shear wave velocities. Soils are classified into four categories as soft soils, stiff soils, dense soils/soft rock and hard rock based on the obtained shear wave velocities. The factor of safety (FS) against liquefaction is determined and it is found that the sites with low shear wave velocity have FS &lt; 1 and these are possible liquefiable zones. The results of this study are useful to study the earthquake hazard assessment, and also taking the necessary precautions in the vicinity of the faults/lineaments for the construction of engineering projects such as pipelines, dams, bridges, canal alignments, and cross-drainage structures. ]"

This paper presents a synthesis of the empirical evidence from experimental seabed mining and parallel industries to infer the effects of seabed mineral extraction on marine ecosystems , focusing on polymetallic nodules and ferromanganese concretions. We use a problem-structuring framework to evaluate causal relationships between pressures caused by nodule extraction and the associated changes in marine ecosystems. To ensure that the rationale behind impact assessments is clear, we propose that future impact assessments use pressure-specific expert elicitation. We further discuss integrating ecosystem services in the impact assessments and the implications of current methods for environmental risk assessments . ]"

Metallic contamination (Pb, Cu, Hg) was measured in wastewater and seawater of Casablanca coast. Persistent exposure to pollution depleted antioxidants biomarkers leading to oxidative stress in mussels. , The bivalve mollusks are among the aquatic bioindicators that are commonly used in monitoring water pollution studies, thanks to their behavior and metabolism. They are directly affected by the level of pollution in a given site. During this research, the study of the biological response in gills, hepatopancreas and muscles of indigenous mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis were used for monitoring emissary's pollution in four polluted sites in the coastal environment of Casablanca. Seasonal variations of the activity of antioxidant defence enzymes, catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), as well as lipid peroxidation (LP) were measured as biomarkers within a one year period and compared to mussels from an unpolluted sampling site. This study was completed by analysing a series of abiotic factors (temperature, pH and conductivity) and chemicals (heavy metals; Hg, Pb, Cu) into seawater. Our result showed that the availability of metallic contamination and the environmental stress conditions causes relatively an oxidative stress in this species at each station studied. While the pollution's level clearly varies according to the sampling campaign. Furthermore, they revealed a significant increase in GST activities and LP concentrations and significant decrease in CAT activities in mussels collected in sites with industrial contamination. This negative correlation suggested that the organisms at this location are exposed to a relatively higher level of oxidative stress. This first study in the area confirm that variations of antioxidant defence enzymes activities and LP concentrations in mussels could be used as prospective biomarkers of toxicity in environmental monitoring programs. ]"

During this period the chemistry and the biology of the shelf, slope and ocean waters between 40° and 43°N have previously been undersampled.

Depth and exposure have high potential for species distribution modelling. Acknowledging interaction effects and biotic features enhances modelling efforts. , Due to increasing pressure on the marine environment there is a growing need to understand species–environment relationships. To provide background for prioritising among variables (predictors) for use in distribution models, the relevance of predictors for benthic species was reviewed using the coastal Baltic Sea as a case-study area. Significant relationships for three response groups (fish, macroinvertebrates , macrovegetation) and six predictor categories (bottom topography, biotic features, hydrography, wave exposure, substrate and spatiotemporal variability) were extracted from 145 queried peer-reviewed field-studies covering three decades and six subregions. In addition, the occurrence of interaction among predictors was analysed. Hydrography was most often found in significant relationships, had low level of interaction with other predictors, but also had the most non-significant relationships. Depth and wave exposure were important in all subregions and are readily available, increasing their applicability for cross-regional modelling efforts. Otherwise, effort to model species distributions may prove challenging at larger scale as the relevance of predictors differed among both response groups and regions. Fish and hard bottom macrovegetation have the largest modelling potential, as they are structured by a set of predictors that at the same time are accurately mapped. A general importance of biotic features implies that these need to be accounted for in distribution modelling, but the mapping of most biotic features is challenging, which currently lowers the applicability. The presence of interactions suggests that predictive methods allowing for interactive effects are preferable. Detailing these complexities is important for future distribution modelling. ]"

This teleconnection is thought to result from an atmospheric bridge between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, leading to warm (cold) ENSO events being associated with a relaxation (intensification) of the Atlantic trade winds and of the wind-induced coastal upwelling. This ENSO related modulation of the wind-driven coastal upwelling appears to contribute to the connection observed at the basin-scale between ENSO and SST in the north Atlantic. The ability to use this teleconnection to give warnings of large changes in the West African upwelling several months in advance is successfully tested using data from the 1998 and 1999 ENSO events. ]"

Changes in the freshwater discharge are well correlated with hydrographic properties, namely temperature and salinity, at a coastal site near Seward, Alaska. Changes in the salinity should change the vertical stability, which will affect the mixed layer depth and primary production. Changes in the mixed layer depth concurrent with changes in phytoplankton production may provide a link between zooplankton and freshwater discharge. This is supported by periodicities of 0.5, 1 and 1.2 years that have been found in the zooplankton at Ocean Station P. A positive atmosphere–ocean feedback loop is proposed that could maintain accelerated coastal freshwater discharge at periods similar to those seen in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). This could provide a mechanism that links the PDO with coastal freshwater discharge and consequently relates coastal freshwater discharge to salmon production in Alaska, since the latter depends on zooplankton abundance. ]"

The effects of human adjustments are reviewed here in terms of cross-shore zones because humans tend to compartmentalize landforms and habitats through their actions and regulations. Common human modifications in the beach zone include nourishing beaches, constructing shore protection structures and raking to remove litter. Modifications affecting the dune zone include altering the location, size and stability of dunes using sand-trapping fences, vegetation plantings and bulldozers or replacing dunes with shore-parallel structures. Modifications affecting the landward zone include buildings, roads, and parking lots. Landform and habitat resilience requires levels of dynamism and geomorphic complexity not often found in managed systems. Preserving or enhancing dynamism and complexity requires emphasis on innovative designs rooted in geomorphological and aeolian research. Future studies are suggested for: (1) quantifying the effect of small and large scale beach nourishment designs and sediment characteristics on dune initiation, development, and evolution; (2) quantifying the extent to which size and spacing of human structures and landform alterations inhibit sediment transfers alongshore or onshore; (3) identifying the advantages or disadvantages of “niche” dunes formed by structures; (4) providing quantitative data on the effects of raking or driving on the beach; (5) identifying the role of aeolian landforms on private properties; and (6) identifying alternative ways of employing sand fences and vegetation plantings to increase topographic and habitat diversity. ]"

Herein we provide a review, new analysis and synthesis of existing work, much of it previously only available in government reports, and integrate our recent research on the topic. We outline critical knowledge gaps that need to be addressed by the time that construction begins on any future large diversions. The focus of this study is on “river side” issues and the policy considerations that arise from them. The study includes a quantitative examination of the sediment budget of the Lower Mississippi River as a region of potential diversion construction in South Louisiana, due to its critical control on any future management plans that include large diversions. We conclude that development of a coordinated system of diversions and other restoration strategies for land-building will require parceling this sediment budget out between individual projects. However, this is only possible if the input function and its variability is well understood. It is clear that numerical simulations are the only way to adequately predict the combined effects of multiple diversions and other restoration projects, such as dredge-fed pipelines, on the river channel for navigation, flood control and sediment regime. Numerical models also provide the only way to properly examine diversion structures to maximize their sediment capture and minimize any negative impacts. The status of these models and their application to lower Mississippi River channel hydrodynamics and sediment transport is examined herein. ]"

The physical processes that control flow, transport, and the formation and distribution of reactive zones in beach aquifers (e.g., tides, waves, density gradients, precipitation, episodic ocean events, and evaporation) operate across overlapping temporal and spatial scales, and present challenges for measuring and modeling physical flow and biogeochemical processes in coastal groundwater systems. Geologic heterogeneity introduces further complexity by modifying flowpaths, mixing patterns, and rates of biotransformation .

Historical, geological, archeological and instrumental records are examined. We evaluate seismic and aseismic generation mechanisms and 22 tsunamigenic zones. A variety of criteria for tsunami source discrimination are applied. Strong tsunami repeat time is 90 years on average, hazard implications are discussed. , The origin of tsunamis in the Mediterranean region and its connected seas, including the Marmara Sea, the Black Sea and the SW Iberian Margin in the NE Atlantic Ocean, is reviewed within the geological and seismotectonic settings of the region. A variety of historical documentary sources combined with evidence from onshore and offshore geological signatures, geomorphological imprints, observations from selected coastal archeological sites, as well as instrumental records, eyewitnesses accounts and pictorial material, clearly indicate that tsunami sources both seismic and non-seismic (e.g. volcanism , landslides) can be found in all the seas of the region with a variable tsunamigenic potential. Local, regional and basin-wide tsunamis have been documented. An improved map of 22 main tsunamigenic zones and their relative potential for tsunami generation is presented. From west to east, the most important tsunamigenic zones are situated offshore SW Iberia, in the North Algerian margin, in the Tyrrhenian Calabria and Messina Straits, in the western and eastern segments of the Hellenic Arc, in the Corinth Gulf of Central Greece, in the Levantine Sea offshore the Dead Sea Transform Fault and in the eastern side of the Marmara Sea. Important historical examples, including destructive tsunamis associated with large earthquakes, are presented. The mean recurrence of strong tsunamis in the several basins varies greatly but the highest event frequency (1/96 years) is observed in the east Mediterranean basin. For most of the historical events it is still unclear which was the causative seismic source and if the tsunami was caused by co-seismic slip, by earthquake-triggered submarine landslides or by a combination of both mechanisms. In pre-historical times, submarine volcanic eruptions (i.e. caldera collapse, massive pyroclastic flows , volcanogenic landslides) and large submarine landslides caused important tsunamis although little is known about their source mechanisms. We conclude that further investigation of the tsunami generation mechanisms is of primary importance in the Mediterranean region. Inputs from tsunami numerical modeling as well as from empirical discrimination criteria for characterizing tsunami sources have been proved particularly effective for recent, well-documented, aseismic landslide tsunamis (e.g., 1963 Corinth Gulf, 1979 Côte d'Azur, 1999 Izmit Bay, 2002 Stromboli volcano). Since the tsunami generation mechanisms are controlled by a variety of factors, and given that the knowledge of past tsunami activity is the cornerstone for undertaking tsunami risk mitigation action, future interdisciplinary research efforts on past tsunamis are needed. ]"

Seagrass has a spatially heterogeneous effect on shoreline morphodynamics. Seagrass needs to generate a gradient in sediment transport to affect the shoreline. Seagrass can cause downdrift erosion. , Coastal ecosystems , such as seagrass meadows , have been heralded as a nature-based solution for coastal protection. However, the functions of seagrass meadows, including wave attenuation and sediment stabilisation, have typically been measured offshore and do not directly translate to coastal protection at the shoreline . In contrast, the protective effects of conventional submerged structures, such as breakwaters and artificial reefs , on adjacent shorelines have been well described and are predictable. Importantly, these artificial structures often cause erosion in adjacent areas. This study examines how seagrass may affect shoreline morphodynamics by making inferences from existing knowledge of conventional submerged structures. Both conventional submerged structures and seagrass meadows affect wave height and direction, yet this effect on longshore sediment transport has only been considered within the context of coastal defence structures. From the conventional literature on submerged structures, it is known that a constant rate of longshore sediment transport will result in a constant shoreline shape. Therefore, a change in the rate of longshore sediment transport, or gradient, generates changes in the shoreline shape and, hence, the shoreline morphodynamics. We propose that seagrass also has spatially heterogeneous effects on shoreline morphodynamics, with protection occurring in some locations and downstream erosion likely in others. Empirical and modeling research is required to test this hypothesis. In the meantime, this review suggests contexts under which seagrass may affect shoreline morphodynamics and provide shoreline protection. This research bridges the gaps in knowledge across marine ecology , physical oceanography and coastal engineering to overcome some of the challenges of interdisciplinary coastal science. ]"

These very high tidal ranges results in unique patterns of sedimentation within hypertidal estuaries. Such systems are not common but they do occur on a number of continents. This report will discuss six areas that have the highest tides in the world. North America hypertidal systems occur within Cook Inlet in Alaska, USA, Leaf Basin in Ungava Bay, Quebec Province, Canada, and the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Canada. In South America, the Straits of Magellan and associated Atlantic coastal settings exhibit hypertidal conditions. European hypertidal systems include Bristol Channel and Severn estuary in southwest England and the Gulf of St. Malo in Normandy, France. These six areas have the highest tides in the world and spring tidal ranges that regularly exceed 10 m. All the six areas can be divided into intertidal sedimentological zones. Zone 1 is the outermost zone and contains longitudinal bars. Zone 2 exhibits laterally extensive sand flats. Zone 3 includes the innermost extent of tides and estuarine point bars. Annual and neap–spring cycles have been documented in Zone 3 and are probably the most indicative features of hypertidal systems. The North American systems occur in high-latitude cold climates where winter ice can have a minor or major impact on the development of sedimentary facies.

However, very little has been investigated about how SGD affects society and, specifically, human well-being. This study systematically examines the published scientific literature on the social implications of SGD by using an Ecosystem Service (ES) perspective. Coastal services provided by ecosystems dependent on SGD are analyzed and clustered in the four main categories of Ecosystem Services (i.e., Provisioning, Supporting, Regulating and Cultural), which are in turn divided into subcategories defined as outcomes. This allows identifying and discussing both benefits and threats to coastal societies resulting from SGD outcomes. From the 1532 articles initially reviewed, the most frequently mentioned category was the supporting services (835) due to the mainstream trend in scientific literature to focus on the role of SGD as a process influencing coastal biogeochemical cycles. Conversely, cultural ES were mentioned in only 49 cases, which should not necessarily be interpreted as a lack of research or interest in this topic, but that this type of references are often not found in the scientific literature but in the grey literature. A detailed publication review was additionally conducted, identifying 114 case-studies from 96 different locations worldwide that reported cases in which SGD had social implications on the well-being. Our review also shows how the different types of Ecosystem Services can have multiple synergies and trade-offs between them, resulting in unequal impacts among stakeholder groups. Overall, this study identifies research gaps related to Ecosystem Services provided by SGD as well as opportunities for further studies, while developing an analytical framework that relies on the Ecosystem Services approach to guide future research on the social implications of SGD. ]"

It is argued that rural communities are more willing to participate proactively in such initiatives and that their relatively close association with the natural resources in question dictates that such participation is of particular importance. Urban communities, on the other hand, are less closely associated with natural resources and are less likely to take an interest in such initiatives, whilst recreational communities, especially those that are relatively diffuse, are more likely to take a reactive role in objecting to proposed management restrictions. It is concluded that, like many aspects of local coastal management, the approaches taken to community participation should be tailored to local characteristics, and that it is difficult to define an approach that represents ‘best practice’, though general approaches to improving the management formulation process by providing for community input are being developed and more widely applied in the UK. Issues related to the balance between providing for meaningful community participation and achieving strategic management objectives are considered, as are the possible reasons why community participation has a relatively low profile in the UK. ]"

The NPZ model is that of Franks, Wroblewski and Flierl (1986) , with the zooplankton state variable parameterized for macrozooplankton. IBM simulations are done with different scenarios for behavioral responses; the interaction of the organisms with the circulation is evaluated by examining growth/development, reproduction, survival and distribution. Since ocean productivity in coastal upwelling systems is greatest nearshore, zooplankton production is favored by nearshore retention. Model results, using an idealized, intermittently wind-forced, upwelling circulation, indicate that non-migrating copepods are flushed from the nearshore system in offshore zonal surface flow; highest population abundances occur offshore, in a region of relatively low food resources. Conversely, migrating copepods interact with the stratified zonal flow within the upwelling system and are retained nearshore when the amplitude of the DVM is sufficient to place the individuals in near-bottom onshore flow during the day. Environmental features, like deep-extending food resources, and physiological controls, like satiation or body size, that permit copepods to remain deeper, or spend more time away from the surface, favor nearshore retention. Diel vertical migration is one mechanism, which may permit animals to exploit favorable habitats located nearshore in upwelling systems. ]"

Their identification typically depends on direct field observations and is therefore challenging in the marine environment, where the interpretation mostly relies on sparse geophysical data. This review presents, based on 118 published case studies, a summary of morphological evidence that can be used to identify submerged relict coastal features worldwide, using only geophysical data. Four coastal feature categories that can be used as palaeoshoreline indicators were identified: (1) beach ridges of wind and wave origin; (2) shoreface strata; (3) marine terraces ; and (4) coral-reef terraces. In light of this proposed classification, an area of ~200,000 km 2 was investigated along the Rowley Shelf (North West Shelf, Australia), a carbonate-dominated platform, based on the integration of high-resolution bathymetry (i.e., seismic-derived bathymetry, satellite-derived bathymetry, multibeam echosounder bathymetry, spot depth soundings) and 2D reflection seismic lines. Relict features were discriminated from modern bedforms using five criteria: (1) stratigraphic position; (2) emersion features; (3) similarity with modern and published analogues; (4) integration of modern ocean conditions; and (5) evidence of early cementation . In total, over 500 submerged relict coastal features were identified, making this review the most comprehensive catalogue published to date. Relict features are concentrated over specific depths, referred to as modal sea-level depths (MSLDs), which correspond to depths where the relative sea level remained stable over long periods of time. Nine MSLDs are observed at 20, 35, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 105 and 125 m below sea level. Each MSLD is the result of the accumulation of coastal features through multiple glacial/ interglacial cycles. Most of the features may nevertheless be related to the last glacial sea-level fall and were likely formed between Marine Isotopes Stages (MIS) 5 and 2. The analysis of the submerged coastal features indicates that the overall shelf morphology is controlled by the distribution of these features, and that, while in a carbonate province, their formation is related to wind, tide, fluvial and wave processes. The higher concentration of relict fluvial-influenced features at shallower depths and of relict tide-influenced features at greater depths suggest that fluvial runoffs were limited during glacial periods. This, in turn, supports the hypothesis of a prevalent dry climate during glacial periods and in contrast, of a humid climate during interglacial periods. Finally, the study reveals that most modern coral reefs of the Rowley Shelf are growing on top of relict coastal features and that seabed ridges previously interpreted as drowned coral reefs are, in fact, likely to be relict coastal features formed through clastic processes. Results from this study will support the identification of submerged palaeoshorelines on continental shelves around the globe and highlight the influence of associated relict coastal features on shelf morphologies. Additionally, this study provides new insights on processes shaping carbonate provinces. ]"

Si -limitation of diatoms instead ensued during these last anthropogenic perturbations of agricultural effluents and sewage loadings. Consequently, ~ 15% of total world-wide annual asthma trigger responses, i.e. amounting to ~ 45 million adjacent humans during 2004, resulted from brevetoxin and palytoxin poisons in aerosol forms of western boundary current origins.

Regular monitoring of this section to 160 km offshore resumed in July 1997 as part of the GLOBEC Long Term Observational Program; the recent data provide observations in Oregon coastal waters of El Niño 1997–98 and La Niña conditions that followed. The complete seasonal data from the decade 1961–1971 provide a basis for comparison with the recent temperature and salinity sections, steric height profiles, geostrophic velocity, and water mass characteristics. These data, and sporadic observations in intervening years, allow us to compare conditions during several ENSO events with the recent event and to search for evidence of climate change. The PFEL Coastal Upwelling Index, sea level from the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center, the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and outflow from the Columbia River are used to distinguish local and remote causes of variability in physical oceanographic conditions off Oregon. The sequence of El Niño/La Niña/El Niño in 1963–66, during a cool phase of PDO, provides a comparison to El Niño/La Niña of 1997–2000. El Niño in 1982–83 and 1997–98, during a warm phase of PDO, caused the largest oceanographic anomalies in the 40 years. The comparison indicates warming of the coastal ocean off Oregon and suggests a modulation of ENSO effects by PDO. Such modulation would mask evidence for secular climate change in our 40-year oceanographic data series. ]"

Measurements of sea surface temperature (SST), mixed layer depth, and upwelling indices provided concurrent data on physical oceanographic parameters. Both total zooplankton and krill abundance dramatically declined in the summer of 1997 coincident with a rapid increase in SST and mixed layer depth. Changes in euphausiid community composition occurred in concert with the decline in overall abundance. The relative abundance of the southern neritic Nyctiphanes simplex increased from August to November in 1997, the abundance of cold temperate Euphausia pacifica decreased significantly, and that of the northern neritic Thysanoessa spinifera declined dramatically. The sudden appearance of an adult cohort of N. simplex in July 1997 suggests that rapid poleward flow characteristic of coastally trapped Kelvin waves occurred between June and July of 1997. The persistent presence of warm temperate and subtropical taxa in samples collected between August 1997 and October 1998 indicates that this poleward flow continued in 1998. Zooplankton abundance, euphausiid community composition, and physical oceanographic parameters gradually returned to a more typical upwelling-dominated state in the spring and summer of 1998. E. pacifica and T. spinifera abundances gradually increased during the summer and fall of 1998, while N. simplex abundance abruptly declined in the spring of 1998. However, this recovery was confined to a narrow coastal band as a result of the onshore movement of the oceanic waters of the California Current. This was reflected by higher than normal numbers of the oceanic Nematoscelis difficilis within samples collected during the spring and summer of 1998. By the spring and summer of 1999, both zooplankton and euphausiid abundance had increased to the highest levels recorded during the 3-year study. Both E. pacifica and T. spinifera abundance increased relative to 1998 while N. simplex was completely absent in all samples. These changes reflected the cooler, highly productive environmental conditions associated with the 1998/1999 La Niña. ]"

A multidisciplinary study of coastal processes allowed us to identify main types of coast evolution: abrasion, accumulation, and stability. Predominance of abrasion is the main feature of modern dynamics of the Azov shores. Not only the parent rock shores are subjected to erosion, but also accumulative forms are eroded. The eastern coast of the sea retreats most rapidly. The intensity of the abrasion and landslide processes is due to the weak resistance of the rocks composing the coast to the wave forcing. In particular, intense abrasion occurs in those parts of the coast where wave forcing is strong together with the surges caused by onshore winds, while the beaches are narrow or completely absent. At the same time, the percentage of beach-forming fractions in eroded soils is low, and the major part of the abrasion material in the form of suspended matter is transported to the deep parts of the sea. In general, the state and dynamics of the Azov coasts are influenced by abrasion-accumulative processes, sea level fluctuations, changes in the wind-wave regime parameters, and fluctuations in the biogenic beach-forming material volumes. The biogenic factor is the most important in the balance of deposits of accumulation forms (spits and bay-bars). Anthropogenic activity also affects the current state of the shores. The transport of beach-forming alluvial sediments into the sea is reduced because of the regulated river discharge. The natural evolution of onshore processes is disrupted during the development of the coast: agricultural activities, industrial and resort construction, removal of sand and shell material, construction of shore protection facilities. ]"

To do so, we have developed a coupled modeling system composed of linked regional and global circulation models. The regional model, configured with 13–22 km resolution in the CGOA, is forced at the surface by observed heat fluxes and wind stresses, at the continental boundaries by observed runoff, and at the open ocean boundaries by a combination of tracer climatologies and sub-tidal velocity and tidal elevation provided by a global finite element model. In this communication, we describe the coupled system, including its present method of intermodel coupling, describe a series of multi-year model hindcasts, compare hindcast results with Eulerian and Lagrangian field data obtained in the CGOA in fall 1996, and assess the impact of global information (barotropic sub-tidal velocities and tidal elevations) on the regional model under the present coupling strategy. We find that the regional model produces appropriate current systems (Alaskan Stream, Alaska Coastal Current) and scalar fields, but with mesoscale variability (of SSH and velocities) at somewhat reduced strength relative to data, and with temperature gradients somewhat larger than those observed. Barotropic sub-tidal information from the global model penetrates the regional model interior, supplying additional mesoscale variability, and modifying regional velocity and scalar fields in both shallow and deep areas. Tidal information exerts a significant influence on sub-tidal scalar and velocity structure only in specific shallow areas, where the tides (and tidal mixing) are strongest. Pending the exploration of alternate coupling schemes, we infer from these results that on a time scale of months, purely barotropic information from outside the CGOA will have a modest impact on its mean regional circulation, but a potentially stronger impact on the statistics and details of mesoscale eddies. ]"

In the past two decades, seagrass research in Vietnam has advanced in many aspects, including distribution mapping, plant genetics and biophysical characteristics, sustainable use of seagrass beds, restoration and protection of seagrass meadows , establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), and collaborative research with international institutions. In this paper, we presented a state-of-the-art review of recent seagrass research conducted in Vietnam. Despite the recent increase in the number of seagrass studies conducted in Vietnam, these coastal ecosystems continue to be poorly mapped and managed in some areas. Although a number of recent studies highlighted the use of seagrass ecosystems as a coastal bioshield in Vietnam, they have undergone degradation in recent years due to pollution, sedimentation and turbidity , eutrophication and habitat loss. Remote sensing is considered as an effective tool for mapping seagrasses in recent studies, particularly due to the ability to accurately map, model and assess the condition of some hard to access sites. Collaboration among regional authorities, NGOs and research institutions can provide an appropriate basis for understanding these complex systems at a national scale and afford an important scientific reference for supporting management and conservation decisions in Vietnam.

Researchers have shown that these algal blooms, which lead to eutrophication of the local water mass, are limited by the supply of inorganic nitrogen from the various bordering estuaries. We demonstrate using the case of a typical heavily polluted macrotidal estuary, the Scheldt in Belgium and the Netherlands, that the short duration of the algal blooms requires estuarine flux estimation methods with a high temporal resolution. We use the fully transient, multicomponent reactive transport model CONTRASTE to compute inorganic nitrogen fluxes through the mouth of the Scheldt estuary into the North Sea. The model simulations use a detailed dataset of upstream river discharges and solute concentrations along with tidal forcings for a 210 day period between December 1, 1994 and June 30, 1995. Our temporally resolved estimate shows that widely used estuarine flux estimation methods which rely on a steady-state approximation underestimate the inorganic nitrogen loading available to sustain primary production in the North Sea during the period of the algal bloom by 100%. ]"

In the Bahamas, these deposits have been interpreted as the product of extreme storms at the end of the last interglacial (LIG) warm period. In contrast, the extensive chevrons complex exposed in S-Madagascar and on the western coast of Australia have been associated with a tsunami induced by a meteorite impact .

Under the Mediterranean climate, some of these lagoons might dry out during summer due to drought events. We propose the term Mediterranean Temporary Lagoons (MTLs) for these ephemeral water bodies and discuss their definition and characteristics. This term emerged in France among its coastal zone managers, who now commonly use it for conservation purposes. It is used in both natural systems as well as most artificial salt ponds in abandoned saltworks. In Europe, two directives have integrated lagoons as key targets to be preserved. Nonetheless, a certain discrepancy in the different definitions of lagoons has constrained joint actions. Indeed, while institutional definitions were originally derived from the scientific concept, their legislative and managerials meanings have been gradually modified and nowadays often differ from the original concept to create difficulties in the field. In addition, while it has been recommended to consider MTLs as a coastal lagoon habitat in the European Habitat Directive, its interpretation among EU member states is unsettled. Thus, clarifying lagoon habitats' terminology is required to ensure better management, monitoring and planning, and coordinate conservation actions. We discuss the inclusion of MTLs in habitat 1150 by confronting scientific and institutional literature and propose a new framework to better delimitate lagoon habitat around the Mediterranean basin, integrating MTLs. MTLs represent a specific habitat that hosts a pool of stenoecious macrophytes of conservation interest like Althenia filiformis , Riella helicophylla or Tolypella salina . ]"

Understanding the current SWI situation and forming research consensus are of great significance for further studies and coastal water resources management. In this study, we analyzed the SWI-associated literature available from the Science of Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) bibliographic database by using CiteSpace to further excavate existing research achievement. We explored a new method for identifying global geographic distributions of 501 coastal cities where SWI has been reported. It can be found that SWI is more likely to occur in well-recharged major basins (recharge rate 100–300 mm/a) or local shallow aquifers with high population density. According to current reports, about 32% of the coastal metropolitan cities (population &gt; 1 million within 150 km from coastline) have been threatened. There was a 20-fold increase rate in the number of papers related to SWI compared to that in general science and technology. The United States of America, China, Australia were the top 3 contributors in SWI scope, contributed 46.4% of the total number of articles. More than 600 researches were supported by Chinese funds, which made China become the second contributor. But the number of citations per Chinese article was the lowest among the top 10 contributors. By co-citation analysis, we identified top 5% articles, and elaborated the background knowledge by taking Top 10 co-cited articles as example. A series of keywords with high co-occurrence were identified. Their meanings and relations were stated and graphically illustrated. As a keyword, SWI frequently appears in the following five research directions: analysis of the location or morphology of fresh and salt water interface, the prediction of groundwater quality, the geothermal circulation and tectonic activities, the coastal mangrove wetlands protection, and the management of water resources in coastal zones. We critically evaluated the bibliometric results and reviewed future opportunities and challenges for this field. With the development of new technology and the accumulation, the improvement of coastal environment will certainly benefit from the study of SWI. ]"

Delile meadow in an area affected by a harbor. The annual growth, photosynthesis and rhizome starch concentrations of seagrass were measured and related to changes in light availability and dissolved nutrient concentration along a gradient of meadow degradation from areas close to the harbor outwards. Environmental and plant variables were measured in three stations placed along this gradient and compared with a reference station at an undisturbed meadow. The light attenuation coefficient ( k ) increased toward the inner harbor area, mainly due to sediment resuspension. The shoot density and leaf productivity of P. oceanica shoots were much lower in disturbed stations of the inner harbor area than in the outer, less disturbed station and the reference meadow. However, daily leaf carbon gains, calculated from the photosynthetic rates at saturating irradiance ( P max ) and the daily period in which seagrass receives light higher than its saturating irradiance ( H sat ), suggested positive C-balance in all stations. This was partly explained by photo-acclimatization of seagrass to the reduced light availability at the disturbed harbor stations (inner and intermediate), as indicated by the lengthening of H sat and the decrease in saturating irradiance ( I sat ) and respiratory demands. Despite photo-acclimatization, disturbed harbor stations showed less positive C-balance, seen not only in their lower leaf growth and biomass but also in a decrease in rhizome carbohydrate reserves (starch). Our results suggest that light reduction account for the reduced seagrass productivity and abundance. However, meadow decline (in terms of shoot mortality) in the harbor area is well above that predicted from similar light environments of nearby meadows or simulated in shading experiments. Thus, there are other factors than light limitation involved in seagrass mortality, most probably through more complex interactions (e.g. nutrient-epiphytes-grazers, water quality––siltation). ]"

Within the GOM, ocean acidification is spatially variable and numerous physical and biogeochemical processes contribute collectively to carbonate chemistry dynamics. , Ocean acidification (OA) has resulted in global-scale changes in ocean chemistry, which can disturb marine organisms and ecosystems. Despite its extensively populated coastline, many marine-dependent communities, and valuable economies, the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) remains a relatively understudied region with respect to acidification. In general, the warm waters of the GOM are better buffered from acidification compared to higher latitude seas, yet long-term acidification has been documented in several GOM regions. OA within the GOM is recognized as spatially variable, particularly within the coastal zone where numerous physical and biogeochemical processes contribute to carbonate chemistry dynamics. The historical progression of OA within the entire GOM is difficult to assess because only a few dedicated long-term monitoring sites have recently been established, and full-water column observations are limited. However, environmental drivers on smaller scales that affect GOM acidification were found to include freshwater, nutrient, and carbonate discharge from large rivers; ocean warming, circulation and residence times; and episodic extreme weather events. GOM marine ecosystems provide essential services, including coastline protection and carbon dioxide removal, and habitats for many marine species that are economically and ecologically important. However, organismal and ecosystem responses to OA are not well constrained for the GOM due to a lack of studies examining the specific effects of OA on regionally relevant species under contemporary and projected conditions. Tackling the vast number of remaining scientific unknowns in this region can be coordinated through regional capacity networks, such as the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Acidification Network (GCAN), working to achieve a system-wide understanding of Gulf OA and its impacts.

Random-systematic line-transect surveys of marine mammals were conducted monthly from August to November 1996, and from May to November 1997–99. CTDs and zooplankton net tows were conducted opportunistically, and at 10 predetermined locations. Hydroacoustic backscatter was measured continuously while underway to estimate prevalence of zooplankton, with emphasis on euphausiids, a key trophic link between primary production and higher trophic level consumers. The occurrences of several of the California Current’s most common cetaceans varied among years. The assemblage of odontocetes became more diverse during the El Niño with a temporary influx of warm-water species. Densities of cold-temperate Dall’s porpoise, Phocoenoides dalli , were greatest before the onset of El Niño, whereas warm-temperate common dolphins, Delphinus spp., were present only during the warm-water period associated with El Niño. Rorqual densities decreased in August 1997 as euphausiid backscatter was reduced. In 1998, as euphausiid backscatter slowly increased, rorqual densities increased sharply to the greatest observed values. Euphausiid backscatter further increased in 1999, whereas rorqual densities were similar to those observed during 1998. We hypothesize that a dramatic reduction in zooplankton biomass offshore during El Niño 1997–98 led to the concentration of rorquals in the remaining productive coastal upwelling areas, including Monterey Bay. These patterns exemplify short-term responses of cetaceans to large-scale changes in oceanic conditions. ]"

The conditions that favor the formation of the SU in high-gradient settings are highlighted. The formation of the SU controlled by regional uplift and glacio-eustasy is not described by classic models. , The interplay between high-frequency relative sea-level changes, such as those connected to late Quaternary glacio-eustasy, and regional uplift usually produces staircases of marine terraces along coastal areas. These particular settings are characterized by variable topography and gradient of the landscape due to both tectonics and wave erosion, which result in the development of subaerial unconformities during both transgressive and forced regressive stages of the high-frequency relative sea-level curve. In particular, the increased topographic gradient due to tectonic uplift results in a coastal profile steeper than the transgressive shoreline trajectory and the consequent formation of a retreating coastal cliff fronted by a transgressive wave ravinement surface, whereas subaerial exposure occurs landwards. In contrast, the relatively low-gradient wave ravinement surface formed during transgression seaward of the coastal cliff affords the deposition of a highstand shallow-marine prograding wedge characterized by a relatively low-gradient top, gentler than the forced regressive shoreline trajectory, resulting in the formation of a new subaerial unconformity at the top of highstand and forced regressive deposits during relative sea-level fall. The overall uplifting conditions favor the persistent development of the already formed transgressive and forced regressive subaerial unconformities also during the highstand and lowstand stages of the high-frequency relative sea-level curve, excepting for the accumulation of continental deposits just seaward of the uplifted paleo-coastal cliffs. The repetition of such a motif for several high-frequency relative sea-level changes will result in the formation of a long-term, higher rank subaerial unconformity expanding seaward and recording the uplift of the coastal area. The way in which the subaerial unconformity develops in contexts dominated by regional uplift and superimposed glacio-eustatic sea-level changes is not described by classic sequence stratigraphic models and this needs to be taken into account in sequence stratigraphic analysis. ]"

These shoals now control the pattern of shoreline erosion and provide a template for possible stepwise evolution of the coast under any future sea-level rise.

Here the behavior of the barrier is conditioned by the antecedent morphology of both the beach face and stream outlet bedforms. Finally, the rock platform coast of Co. Antrim presents a far more resistant shoreline to incident marine processes, yet even here there is strong evidence of present process control over so-called ‘raised’ platforms and embayments. It is concluded that coastal sediment supply and dynamics, together with coastal morphology and its interaction with waves, present a far more complex variety of sea-level indicators than is normally acknowledged. ]"

This paper presents a review of the geomorphology of karst landforms including caves, sinkholes, etc. in southern Africa. It further presents the environmental threats and challenges faced by these karst landscapes, their genesis and controlling factors, as well as their possible mitigation and remedial measures. The karst landscapes in the region are most abundant in the interior of the sub-continent, whereas coastal karst is sparsely distributed, and is mainly found in the Eastern and Western Cape, and Kwa-Zulu Natal provinces of South Africa, as well as parts of Namibia. The karst of the interior is largely limited to the Proterozoic dolomitic limestone, while coastal karst is formed in the Tertiary coastal limestone and Quaternary calcareous sandstones . The human impacts threatening karst in southern Africa include mining and mineral extraction, construction and development, agricultural activities, climate change, and changes in the local hydrogeology . Anthropogenic impacts have particularly affected the karst landscape of the Gauteng and northern Free State Provinces of South Africa due to groundwater extraction associated with mining. Changes in land use and water management, consequential to development pressures and a variety of climate change scenarios, are the most significant threats currently facing southern African karst terrain. It is argued that sustainable engineering technologies, informed by sound geomorphological research, are necessary to ensure that future development, property, and life on karst terrain are safe from avoidable environmental problems. ]"

Iberian and Celtic continental margins—effects of coastal upwelling? ],"[ Megafauna biomass and feeding guilds were studied on the NW Iberian upwelling Continental Margin in order to determine the presence of enriched zones pointing to enhanced particle input. We compare these findings with similar data obtained from a transect across the Celtic Continental Margin that represents a regime without coastal upwelling. Additionally sediment concentrations of phytopigments (chlorophyll-a, phaeophorbides) representing recent inputs of algal production and of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) are used as proxies for microbial biomass, to assess if there was a relation between these parameters and the megafauna distribution. The sediment on the upper slope (&lt;1600 m) of the Iberian Margin was found to be inhabited by filter-feeding megafauna (26–73% of total invertebrate density, and 1–35% of biomass), and contained relatively low levels of phytopigments (3–6 ng/cm 3 chlorophyll-a) and nucleic acids (12–16 μg −1 DNA, 1.5–3.5 μg −1 RNA). In contrast, on the upper slope of the Celtic Margin the dominant component of the megafauna were deposit-feeders (57–92% of total invertebrate density, and 23–90% of biomass) and the sediments contained higher concentrations of phytopigments and nucleic acid. These observations, supplemented by video records revealing the presence of current ripples on the Iberian upper slope, show that these upper slope regions are non-depositional, high energy environments. Conditions at the lower slope and the abyssal plain on the Iberian transect were more quiescent with large deposit-feeding holothurians dominating the megafauna (72–94% of invertebrate biomass), and with relatively high sediment concentrations of phytopigments (7–9 ng/cm 3 chlorophyll-a, 157–170 ng/cm 3 phaeophorbides) and nucleic acids (21–38 μg −1 DNA, 2.4–5.5 μg −1 RNA). On the basis of our data we argue that the benthic food for the deepest stations on the Iberian transect does not consist of shelf derived organic matter. More likely, fast sinking offshore blooms, possibly associated with filaments of upwelling water, form the major contribution to the annual food supply of the deep living megafauna. ]"

Coastal uplifts and liquefaction affect the coasts and marine biota. Impacts range from mass mortality to rapid colonization by opportunistic species. Recovery times to a pre-disturbance state generally ranged between two to three years. Meiofaunal communities are less impacted by large-scale disturbance. , Marine communities are dynamic and spatially heterogeneous. Earthquakes and tsunamis modulate the structure of marine communities at short and long-term scales. The objective of this review was to evaluate how such disturbances impact the morphodynamics of coastal areas and the dynamics and structure of marine benthic communities from soft and hard bottoms from intertidal, subtidal and deep-sea habitats. The results reveal that earthquakes and tsunamis caused mortality of algae and bivalves by dissection after coastal uplift. Changes on the vertical distribution of nematodes and coral fragmentation were also recorded. Recovery of the marine communities to pre-disturbance state occurred by migration and recolonization of impacted habitats. The meiofaunal organisms recovered quickly, while some communities recovered after three years. Information pre-disturbance is often lacking or covers a short temporal extent. It is important to establish long-term monitoring programs in areas where the likelihood of impact of disturbance of such magnitude is high to understand how marine communities are shaped at geological scales. ]"

Satellite altimetry is suitable for contemporary sea level observations at global and regional scales. Integration of multiple systems is essential for detailed understating of global, regional and local mean sea level change. Densification of tide gauges and co-located GNSS networks and improvement in precision of satellite altimetry is required. Spatial data science techniques such as data engineering and trend estimation are pertinent to sea level studies. , Significant developments have been made in the observation systems and techniques of estimating sea level towards meeting the standard accuracy requirement of Global Climate Observation Systems (GCOS). This study undertakes a systematic review of the current advances in estimating sea level change in the context of the 4th industrial revolution. Trends in the use of main observation systems such as tide gauges, satellite altimetry , and ancillary systems such as GNSS and Autonomous Surface Vehicles were explored. Crucially, we examined the contribution of dedicated waveform retracking strategies, advanced corrections and radar technology such as Ka-band altimetry of SARAL/Altika and SAR mode innovations to the progress in coastal altimetry. Further, we show the role of emerging spatial data science concepts and processing workflows in sea level study. Findings suggest that in-situ sea level observation through tide gauges remains the best approach for long-term coastal sea level study despite its limitations while satellite altimetry is suitable for contemporary global and regional scales. Detailed understating of global, regional and local mean sea level change will require an augmentation of tide gauge, satellite altimetry and other ancillary remote sensing and in situ systems. Densification of tide gauges and co-located GNSS networks at sparsely covered regions and improvement in precision of satellite altimetry data for coastal use are also essential for a fully integrated sea level observation system. From the analysis of over 30 trend models that span exploratory, parametric, non-parametric, stochastic and advanced classes in the literature, we conclude that the best model is the one with good statistical foundation and similar assumption with the sea level pattern. ]"

We review how researchers are experimenting with new techniques; grappling with quantifying the effects of multiple processes on resultant landforms; and exploring how well rock coast systems relate to wider geomorphological and earth science debates. Recent research, including those in this special issue, aptly demonstrate the scientific benefits that can be accrued by studying rock coasts at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, by considering the effect of the wide range of processes that operate on them, and by the application of new measurement techniques and approaches. Despite these advances, there is ample scope for future research, which could profit from increasing collaboration with other coastal geomorphologists and allied earth science disciplines in order to identify and quantify linkages between rock coasts and other coastal systems. It is also important that new research considers how rock coasts will respond to extreme events and to risks associated with changing climate, and to how rock coast geomorphology might contribute, beyond coastal science, to wider debates in theoretical geomorphology. ]"

To meet this demand, over pumping of groundwater is practised in majority of the PICs, which eventually causes saltwater intrusion (SWI) in coastal aquifers. The geographical location of PICs makes them more vulnerable to natural means of SWI. However, anthropogenic activities also cause groundwater contamination in PICs.

Most CME services tools can only indirectly help build monetary awareness. The monetary value measurement of CME services for MPAs is best based on the biophysical production of services in MPAs. , Coastal marine resource over-exploitation has led to the loss of marine biodiversity and environmental degradation. This has serious consequences to Coastal and Marine Ecosystems (CME) and ecosystem services. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can have positive influences on adjacent fisheries and habitat recovery, which can help resolve these issues. However, quantifying the monetary value of an MPA's potential ecosystem service delivery is notoriously difficult. In this study, we review available tools for evaluating the monetary value of CME services for MPAs. We show that only four out of the 12 most frequently used CME tools incorporate monetary value assessments for MPAs, the rest of the tools can help build monetary awareness but only indirectly. We argue that the monetary value measurement of CME services for MPAs should be based on the biophysical production of services in MPAs rather than from subjective human perspectives (e.g., Willingness to Pay surveys). This requires transdisciplinary knowledge connecting ecology and economy, to produce an ecology-based monetary value measurement. We suggest that developing this novel method could help to better understand the valuation of CME services for MPAs and make a positive influence on marine conservation. ]"

Suitable site selection, value addition and creating market demand are the keys for growth of seaweed industry in Bangladesh. , Seaweeds production can play a significant role in catalyzing sustainable aquaculture activity in many developing countries. Bangladesh has approximately 8500 km 2 (&lt;5 m depth) exploitable coastal area and is home to 335 different types of natural populations of seaweeds, some of which are cultivated on a limited scale due to environmental, technological and socio-economic constraints.

Tidal flat wetlands and radial sand ridge are the special sediment deposits in coastal area, which are the ideal places to study “land-sea interaction”. The 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios in our research samples show that the Pu in most samples is from global fallout, only the Pu in a few samples near Yangtze River Estuary and channel of radial sand ridge is affected by the close-in Pu fallout from Pacific Proving Grounds (PPG), and the contribution of Pu from PPG is 41.5–50%. In composition, since the study samples are mainly sand, the 239+240 Pu activities in our samples are lower than those in river sediments of China. The transport of Pu is a very important scientific issue, and researches have shown that Pu is “transported” into the coastal areas and seas from the land- based “source”.

Design of natural flood defense systems should leverage responses to expected change, e.g., sea-level rise, to ensure sustained effectiveness. , Coastal managers worldwide increasingly recognize the importance of conservation and restoration of natural coastal ecosystems . This ensures coastal resilience and provision of essential ecosystem services, such as wave attenuation reducing coastal flooding and erosion. In the continuum from unvegetated tidal flats to salt marshes and mangroves , fundamental physical controls as well as biotic interactions, and feedbacks among them, determine morphology and vegetation distribution. Although these processes are well described in established literature, this information is rarely applied to understanding the role of these ecosystems as coastal defense. The focus is often on specific elements of the complex system, such as vegetation structure and cover, rather than on their complex natural dynamics. This review examines whether and how the dynamic nature of tidal flat - wetlands systems contributes to, or detracts from, their role in coastal defense. It discusses how the characteristics of the system adjust to external forcing and how these adjustments affect ecosystem services. It also considers how human interventions can take advantage of natural processes to enhance or accelerate achievement of natural coastal defense. ]"

It documents the necessity to respect coastal statesʼ cartographic competences in accordance with international law of the sea , but at the same time, it focuses on the need for fruitful cooperation between states with opposite or adjacent coasts. Reminding the main international conventions to protect the freedom of navigation, to regulate maritime spaces and to safeguard the human life at sea, the paper delves into the technical specifications for nautical charting issued by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).

Impacts of individual desalination plants will combine to cause regional impact. Desalination will adversely impact biodiversity, fisheries, and coastal communities. Desalination will magnify the impact of climate change on the Gulf. Minimising impacts requires behavioural, regulatory, and technological development. , The development of desalination has been essential to the rapid economic development of the countries bordering the Arabian Gulf. The current production capacity of sea water desalination plants drawing water from Gulf is over 20 million m 3 day −1 , which may rise to 80 million m 3 day −1 by 2050. Whilst supporting aspects of sustainable development related to water and sanitation, desalination impacts the marine environment through impingement and entrainment of organisms in intakes, and through thermal, brine and chemical discharges. This may compromise other objectives for sustainable development related to sustainable use of the oceans. Under business as usual scenarios, by 2050, the impact of individual desalination plants will combine causing a regional scale impact. Without mitigating actions to avoid the business as usual scenario, by 2050, desalination in combination with climate change, will elevate coastal water temperatures across more than 50% of the Gulf by at least 3 °C, and a volume of water equivalent to more than a third of the total volume of water between 0 and 10 m deep will pass through desalination plants each year. This will adversely impact the coastal ecosystem of the Gulf, with impacts on biodiversity, fisheries and coastal communities and may cause potential loss of species and habitats from the Gulf. Given the significant implications of these preliminary findings, and in light of the precautionary approach to management, it is recommended that mitigating options addressing behavioural, regulatory and technological change are rapidly evaluated and implemented to avoid the development of desalination in the region along a business as usual pathway, and multidisciplinary research studies should be conducted to reduce uncertainty in predictions of future impacts. ]"

Multiple distributary channels supplied large quantities of sand to the shore, producing beach accretion with extensive black-sand deposits found on the beaches and in continental shelf sands. However, erosion increased as discharges of the river began to decrease in the late 19th century as a result of climate change and construction of dams. The shift from beach accretion to erosion induced a concentration of heavy minerals on stretches of the receding shore, as light minerals were selectively displaced to accretional areas. In this review the physical processes are examined by which waves and currents sort and concentrate the heavy mineral grains according to their densities, sizes and shapes during transport of the beach sand between eroding and accreting shores. As such, the suite of heavy minerals found in delta coastal sands are used as natural tracers of sand movement related to large-scale shoreline change. Results, obtained from several studies undertaken along the length of the Nile Littoral Cell from Alexandria (Egypt) to the northern coast of the northern Israeli and Lebanese margin, are synthesised. These studies illustrate the importance of heavy minerals in identifying sediment point sources, tracing sand transport paths, grain sorting processes, energy levels of transporting agents and sediment provenance (both modern and relict). This contribution also evaluates the potential of applying heavy minerals to discriminate between accreting and eroding beaches and to distinguish a variety of fluvio-marine environments such as river, lagoons, coastal dunes , accretion ridges and continental shelf. ]"

A model of coastal evolution for this area has been constructed. It appears that distinct phases of accretion have occurred during the Holocene as well as a change in the type of sediment transported into this area. Originally of silty clay then sand and finally of gravel, a distinct coarsening-upwards in the sedimentary sequence is apparent. A loss of sediment since the 18th century has resulted in the erosion of Eastbourne's beaches. This current episode of erosion may have important implications for land use. The study of Iron Age forest clearance in the Combe Haven valley of East Sussex exemplifies the inter-relationship of sedimentation between river and coastal systems. At the heart of this relationship is the hypothesis that forest clearance resulted in a substantial release of colluvial material, and a concurrent increase in river discharge. Biostratigraphic evidence, supported by radiocarbon dating, suggests that the development of the floodplain in the Combe Haven valley may be directly linked to forest clearance, and that the estuary of this river was modified by the increase in discharge due to reduced evapotranspiration and increased run off, causing a marine incursion into the lower course of the Combe Haven valley. The results from the two areas discussed suggest cyclic erosion phases associated with a change from one sediment type to another. ]"

Aerosols are the main inputs of exogenous material to this system. The dominant aerosols deposited in the region are from sea spray, soil and salar playa deflation, volcanic emissions, along with secondary aerosols. The whole Atacama region receives particulate matter (minerals, salts, organic compounds, and microorganisms of variable content) from the Pacific Ocean, the coastal desert, and the Andes Cordillera and Altiplano.

Three years of in situ measured wind data at Damietta, Egypt, are used to identify the appropriate wind source for the Southeastern Mediterranean Sea from the available ERA-5 and CFSR wind data. The developed SWAN wind-wave model results are calibrated with six-month directional buoy measurements taken at Idku station along the Egyptian coast. Four different sets of exponential wind-wave growth and Whitecapping dissipation coefficients were examined. Grid resolution and time step are tested to obtain the optimal model settings. The results show that ERA5 wind source is more suitable in Southeastern Mediterranean compared to CFSR wind dataset. The degree of agreement between ERA5 wind data and Damietta observations ranges from 0.87 to 0.9. Komen formula in exponential wind wave growth and Janssen in Whitecapping dissipation with Cds = 2.75, are recommended for Southeastern Mediterranean with grid resolution of 0.05° and a 30-minute temporal resolution.

These studies have documented a variety of characteristic sedimentary and erosional features that can be ascribed to known events. Nevertheless, the question arises whether these structures are just ephemeral or have a potential to be preserved in the geological record . This review describes the changes that have affected muddy to sandy siliciclastic tsunami deposits in Peru. Each of these was surveyed in the first months after the tsunami: Chimbote (1996), Camaná (2001) and Pisco-Paracas (2007). Here, we describe the changes we observed during re-surveys in 2007 and 2008. It has long been recognized that onshore tsunami deposits may suffer from surficial processes, tectonic movements and anthropogenic alteration. Earthquake-induced uplift or subsidence may subject a tsunami deposit to erosion or burial, respectively. Quick burial in rapidly subsiding coastal areas may enhance preservation. Deposits of the last or most landward-reaching wave may be preferentially preserved if they escape erosion by subsequent tsunami waves ; however, inland areas are also vulnerable to subaerial reworking, including by wind and by humans. The Peruvian examples reviewed here show that the preservation of arid-coast tsunami deposits depends on interactions that are more complex that hitherto perceived. These involve sediment type, grain size, depositional setting, co-seismic movement, bioturbation , winds, and anthropogenic modification. In one example, all traces of the tsunami have been removed or reworked by flash floods and ocean waves. In another example, clasts on a coastal plain from tsunami-backwash began to be rounded and abraded by eolian sands immediately after the event. Eolian processes also smoothed and filled tsunami scours. By contrast, muddy tsunami deposits in certain areas escaped erosion by wind, probably because of their greater cohesion. In still another example, 0.5 m of co-seismic uplift was not enough to prevent ocean waves from removing a tsunami sand sheet that had mantled a coastal marsh. The buried record of tsunami deposits on modern coasts may therefore not fully represent the vulnerability of these regions to tsunamigenic hazards. ]"

The size of the fault plane (approximately equal to the tsunami source area) was approximately 10 × 100 and several tens of kilometers in length. The slip distance of the reverse-type faults was less than 20 m. The sedimentary characteristics and depositional processes of tsunami deposits were obtained from deposits in various environments, such as coastal lowlands, marine terraces , coastal lagoons , and inland ponds. Certain unique approaches used to identify tsunami deposits were reviewed, such as gravel layers that intercalate inorganic soils, and a Holocene marine terrace, dinoflagellate cysts , and foraminiferal linings, which are potentially derived from the sea, and chemical features (e.g., the Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ ratio) as indicators of seawater inflow into a coastal lagoon. The spatial distribution and recurrence of earthquakes and tsunamis in the EMJS were found based on previous paleo-tsunami studies. The difference between tsunami deposits caused by offshore active faults and those by megathrust earthquakes only manifests itself in the horizontal and vertical directions, but not in the sedimentary environments and structures. The data thus inferred can be used for the estimation of offshore active fault models and validation of previous tsunami disaster reconstructions in the future. ]"

SeqAPASS bioinformatics can identify bioindicator taxa particularly sensitive to TBT. TBT is a possible human health stressor, endocrine disruptor and obesogen. , Tributyltin (TBT) was widely used as a highly efficient biocide in antifouling paints for ship and boat hulls. Eventually, TBT containing paints became globally banned when TBT was found to cause widespread contamination and non-target adverse effects in sensitive species, with induced pseudohermaphroditism in female neogastropods (imposex) being the best-known example. In this review, we address the history and the status of knowledge regarding TBT pollution and marine TBT hotspots, with a special emphasis on the Norwegian coastline. The review also presents a brief update on knowledge of TBT toxicity in various marine species and humans, highlighting the current understanding of toxicity mechanisms relevant for causing endocrine disruption in marine species. Despite observations of reduced TBT sediment concentrations in many marine sediments over the recent decades, contaminant hotspots are still prevalent worldwide. Consequently, efforts to monitor TBT levels and assessment of potential effects in sentinel species being potentially susceptible to TBT in these locations are still highly warranted. ]"

Recent studies of the winds along the entire coast from 25°N to 50°N indicate that there are significant along-shore variations in the strength of coastal upwelling, which are reflected in the observed temperature distribution. Active upwelling appears to be restricted to a narrow coastal band (about 10–25 km wide) along the entire coast, but the region influenced by coastal upwelling may be much wider. Intensive observations of the upwelling zone during summer off Oregon show the presence of a southward coastal jet at the surface, a mean vertical shear, a poleward undercurrent along the bottom, and persistently sloping isopycnals over the continental shelf; most of the upwelling there occurs during relatively short periods (several days long) of upwelling-favorable winds. During the upwelling season off Oregon, the offshore Ekman transport is carried by the surface Ekman layer, and the onshore return flow occurs through a quasi-geostrophic interior. It is not known whether the structure and dynamics observed off Oregon are typical of the upwelling zone along the entire coast, though some of the same features have been observed off Baja California. Current and future research will eventually show whether the Oregon results are also applicable in the region of persistently strong upwelling-favorable winds off northern California, and in the region of complex bathymetry off central and southern California. ]"

Many of these (termed ‘microbialites’) calcified as they grew but such lithified mats are rare along modern coasts for reasons such as unsuitable water chemistry, destructive metazoan influences and competition with other reef-builders such as corals or macroalgae . Nonetheless, extant microbialites occur in unique coastal ecosystems such as the Exuma Cays , Bahamas or Lake Clifton and Hamelin Pool, Australia, where limitations such as calcium carbonate availability or destructive bioturbation are diminished. Along the coast of South Africa, extensive distributions of living microbialites (including layered stromatolites) have been discovered and described since the early 2000s. Unlike the Bahamian and Australian ecosystems, the South African microbialites form exclusively in the supratidal coastal zone at the convergence of emergent groundwater seepage . Similar systems were documented subsequently in southwestern Australia, Northern Ireland and the Scottish Hebrides, as recently as 2018, revealing that supratidal microbialites have a global distribution. This review uses the best-studied formations to contextualise formative drivers and processes of these supratidal ecosystems and highlight their geological, ecological and societal relevance. Dynamic interchanges between salinity states both exclude many destructive metazoans and competitors and provides optimal nutrient conditions for benthic microbial and microalgal growth. The outflowing groundwater seeps are alkaline and rich in calcium carbonate , which reflects local catchment geological processes . These habitats support a diverse microbial community dominated by Cyanobacteria as well as some metazoan species previously unknown to science, or unknown for the region. Several taxa (from invertebrates to fish) utilise this environment as refugia . Supratidal microbialites are important coastal features because of the organisms they support and the ecological processes that they facilitate, such as habitat connectivity. Culturally and socially, the value of these habitats is increasingly being appreciated, for example as traditional freshwater supply points or as an unrealised geotourism opportunity. This review also frames new information about threats, opportunities for future research and conservation trajectories for these unique geobiological habitats. ]"

Constraints from mineralogy, chemistry and sediment petrography ]","[ Highlights The first study of aeolian mineral deposits covering the full range of mineral commodities. The study addresses Quaternary and pre-Quaternary landforms used as ore guides. Geoscientific data to distinguish aeolian from coastal marine and fluvial environments . It addresses aeolian deposits as to their geomorphological-geodynamic maturity. It addresses aeolian deposits as a function of the climate zones. It constrains the physical–chemical regime of aeolian deposits by marker minerals. , Quaternary aeolian landforms (AL) can convert into aeolian mineral deposits of economic grade through concentration of metals (Ti, Fe, Zr, Sn, REE, Au, PGE), industrial minerals (silica) and gems (diamonds), purification (winnowing) of trash minerals (feldspar, mica) and the provision of accommodation space for uranium and base metals. Therefore, during the study of aeolian deposits (AD), emphasis is placed on the mineral assemblage, chemical composition and numerical data obtained from sedimentology to constrain the potential of accumulating mineral commodities. The physical–chemical regime of AL and AD is characterized by alkaline to neutral fluids and oxidizing conditions during the early stages of deposition. An acidic fluid regime evolves from it during late-stage supergene alteration when reducing conditions are created in fossil dunes and the likelihood of sulfide accumulation gets improved. The climate zones have a strong impact on the sorting of the AD causing different types of vegetation and degrees of wetness, more pronounced in the inland than coastal AL. This is also valid for grain sphericity, the chemical (Ti/Fe ratio) and mineralogical composition (carbonate/ silicate ratio). Chemical residues (e.g. carbocretes, sulcretes) in the fine-grained and clay minerals in coarser-grained fraction are more widespread in arid/semiarid and dry continental climate zones which are the aeolian active ones. Neighboring ones such as the wet-and-dry or humid-mid-latitude climate zones are typical of fossil inland AL and dominated by fluvial environments. With the aid of the trend analyses and composite x-y plots using HM, chemical markers, and sedimentological parameters the aeolian facies can be distinguished from fluvial and coastal environments. The source of the AD is related to the geodynamic setting and the tripartite subdivision into pre-mature, mature and supermature crustal section forms the basis for the classification of AL and AD. HM and chemical markers allow for a attribution of AD to mantle (Cu, Ni, Cr) and crustal (Zr) lithologies. In conclusion, mapping AL and investigating AD using the afore-mentioned parameters can be used as an ore guide and help delineate aeolian mineral deposits. The ore-forming aeolian processes may be subdivided into (1) concentration (light and heavy mineral placers), (2) purification (heavy mineral placers), (3) provision of accommodation space (uranium and base metal deposits). ]"

In many parts of the world, these events have usually occurred in a distant time in the past. As a result, there is low risk perception and a lack of collective memories, making tsunami risk communication both challenging and complex. Furthermore, immense challenges lie ahead as population and risk exposure continue to increase in coastal areas. Through the last decades, tsunamis have caught coastal populations off-guard, providing evidence of lack of preparedness. Recent tsunamis, such as the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004, 2011 Tohoku and 2018 Palu, have shaped the way tsunami risk is perceived and acted upon. Based on lessons learned from a selection of past tsunami events, this paper aims to review the existing body of knowledge and the current challenges in tsunami risk communication, and to identify the gaps in the tsunami risk management methodologies. The important lessons provided by the past events call for strengthening community resilience and improvement in risk-informed actions and policy measures. This paper shows that research efforts related to tsunami risk communication remain fragmented. The analysis of tsunami risk together with a thorough understanding of risk communication gaps and challenges is indispensable towards developing and deploying comprehensive disaster risk reduction measures. Moving from a broad and interdisciplinary perspective, the paper suggests that probabilistic hazard and risk assessments could potentially contribute towards better science communication and improved planning and implementation of risk mitigation measures . ]"

Laws and planning protocols exist but they lack clarity and coherence. Community-based initiatives should be advanced cautiously. , The mangroves of the Sundaic biogeography region in Southeast Asia are ecologically diverse and highly productive. The location of mangroves close to densely populated coastlines, on the other hand, puts them in a perilous situation as socio-economic growth has intensified in the past decades. Thus, research to support conservation of remnant mangroves is urgently required. Critical information is, however, spread across numerous disciplines. Here, we use a range of sources to gain multidisciplinary inputs from as much literature as possible to summarize emerging trends for driving future research to support conservation. This narrative review begins by pointing out the unique values of the biophysical and ecosystem services of Sundaic mangroves. Subsequently, the human beneficiaries of the mangroves are explored, including indigenous sea-people who are rarely mentioned in the literature. To put mangrove degradation and loss into context, past and emerging anthropogenic pressures are evaluated to identify the threats. Key findings include the presence of persistent threats from the agriculture and aquaculture sectors. These are to be expected, but alarmingly, coal-fired power plants and inland hydrological shifts induced by dams also pose major concerns. Although community-based management is often hailed as part of the solution, studies argue that the approach should be attempted cautiously. The latest body of knowledge revealed herein is vital to inform coastal environment management and further drives the direction of research in the Sundaic and other systems globally in which similar socio-economic pressures are experienced. ]"

SSSCHs are: shelf-edge progradational coastal systems; continental shelf, shoal-water coastal systems; coast-disconnected. Local process-regime changes control the amount and type of sediment delivered to canyons from the different SSSCHs. Sea-level variations are the main drivers of SSSCHs’ evolution; their effects influence different systems at different times. The geology and physiography of the margins are also important in setting the character and the timing of SSSCHs. High-frequency perturbations, such as climate changes at a variety of temporal scales, have a large impact on SSSCHs. The results emphasize that process-based approaches are chief practices in the study of continental margin stratigraphy. SSSCHs are a principal archive of environmental changes, and of perturbation signals in a source-to-sink perspective. , Systems Supplying Sediment to Canyon or Slope Channel Heads (SSSCHs) initiate sediment transfer from the shallow water areas to the deep sea. SSSCHs are very sensitive to sea-level variations, to perturbations in sediment production and redistribution and to variations in accommodation in the shelf. Through the analysis of bathymetric and subbottom data, I review the variability in time and space of SSSCHs in the eastern Sardinian and northeastern Sicilian margins of the Tyrrhenian Sea. I distinguish three main types of SSSCHs: type I corresponds to shelf-edge deep-water coastal systems; type II corresponds to continental shelf , shoal-water coastal systems; type III is coast-disconnected. Further subdivisions involve the degree of confinement and the process-regime at the shelf-edge for Type I SSSCHs, and the distance from the canyon head and the process-regime for type II SSSCHs. Coast-disconnected type III SSSCHs consist of shelf-wide depositional belts, both un-channalised and channalised, as well as of landslide complexes. Each of the different SSSCHs has its distinct process-regime, which regulates its capability of sediment transfer to the canyons or channels and eventually to the deep-sea. SSSCHs of type IA and IB develop coastal bodies at the shelf-edge, which store part of the sediment budget . Type IC SSSCHs exhibit a direct connection between a river and a canyon, leading to shelf-edge sediment bypass; direct hyperpycnal discharge and landslides result in the largest efficiency in transferring sediment to the deep sea. The efficiency of type II SSSCHs depends mainly on their distance from the canyon head and on the ability of hyperpycnal flows, both from plunging river-floods and from wave resuspension , and storm waves, in transporting sediment offshore. Type IIC SSSCHs, consisting of tide-dominated shorelines , play a minor role in the study area due to the microtidal regime of the Mediterranean Sea. Type IIIA SSSCHs are also rare, since they correspond to shelf-wide depositional belts, that in the study area only seldom are able to reach the canyon heads. Type IIIB SSSCHs, corresponding to landslide complexes, also have a restricted frequency but can contribute a large amount of sediment to the deep-sea. Sea-level variations have the largest influence on SSSCH evolution along the two margins of the study area. Type I prevails during the falling-stage and the lowstansd of sea level. They are however, also active during the present sea-level highstand in the tectonically active Sicilian margin. Type II SSSCHs dominate the TST but their activation is diachronous, being dependent also on inherited margin physiography. The present review highlights the large spectrum of processes that contribute to sediment supply to canyon or slope channels heads. As a result, the complexity of the initial part of the marine tract of the source to sink system that transports sediment from the shallow-to the deep-sea is uncovered. While stressing the role of the previous evolution of a margin, of tectonic activity, and of climate variations , the present review acknowledges the importance of sea-level variations as a control on SSSCH development. It however shows that the complexity of the sedimentary processes that rules the transfer of sediment to the deep-sea results in times of activity during a cycle of sea-level variations, and consequent depositional histories, which do not conform with those predicted by the sequence stratigraphic models. ]"

I: Northwestern Shelf ],"[ This article describes the hydrography of the Northwestern Shelf (NWS), of the Black Sea emphasizing the changes induced by water management in the Dniejer and Dniester river basins. The existing literature and previously unpublished data have been reviewed and synthesized to describe water property fields and transport mechanisms of the NWS and the Dnieper and Dniester estuaries before the early 1960s, or the so-called precontrol period, when the effect of artificial river flow control upon the coastal waters was insignificant. After the hydroenergy complexes and water withdrawal and disposal systems on rivers became fully operational in the early 1970s (the so-called postcontrol period), the annual river discharge from the Dnieper and Dniester had noticeably decreased and seasonal river flow patterns had been artificially modified. Instead of a powerful and short early spring flood, typical for the natural conditions in the Dnieper river, the hydrographs in the postcontrol period exhibit two smaller peaks of river discharge of much longer period. One of them (winter-early spring) is caused by intense hydroenergy generation and weir discharges through the cascade of storage reservoirs. Another is associated with spring flood, modified by intense water consumption and storage in this period. High average river discharge in late May—early June strengthened the summer pycnocline which inhibits vertical mixing in the estuaries and coastal waters. Owing to a slow summer circulation, the rate of natural purification of the entire coastal system has been reduced. This coupled with the increased nutrient, organic and pollutant transport, decreased the dissolved-oxygen concentration and led to anoxic events and mass mortalities of marine organisms in the previously productive regions. These effects have primarily plagued the benthic communities along the entire western coast of the NWS since 1973. Winter convective overturn in the Black Sea reaches its maximum depth at the southern boundary of the NWS. Thus, the NWS waters descend beneath the seasonal and main thermoclines in the open sea and are spread by the prevailing currents across the entire sea in the cold intermediate layer (CIL). By this dynamic mechanism the projected man-made modifications in the riverine-estuarine systems of the NWS will affect and change the large-scale thermohaline structure and marine life of the Black Sea. ]"

WSRS changed the natural seasonal hydrological rhythm through the artificial flood and the associated sediment delivery. Both sediment source and grain-size composition differs greatly between the two phases of WSRS. WSRS alters the nutrients delivery to the sea, and significantly impacts the coastal biogeochemical process and ecosystem. , The water-sediment regulation scheme (WSRS), beginning in 2002, is an unprecedented engineering effort to manage the Yellow River with the aims to mitigate the siltation both in the lower river channel and within the Xiaolangdi Reservoir utilizing the dam-regulated flood water. Ten years after its initial implementation, multi-disciplinary indicators allow us to offer a comprehensive review of this human intervention on a river-coastal system. The WSRS generally achieved its objective, including bed erosion in the lower reaches with increasing capacity for flood discharge and the mitigation of reservoir siltation. However, the WSRS presented unexpected disturbances on the delta and coastal system. Increasing grain size of suspended sediment and decreasing suspended sediment concentration at the river mouth resulted in a regime shift of sediment transport patterns that enhanced the disequilibrium of the delta. The WSRS induced an impulse delivery of nutrients and pollutants within a short period (~ 20 days), which together with the altered hydrological cycle , impacted the estuarine and coastal ecosystem . We expect that the sediment yield from the loess region in the future will decrease due to soil-conservation practices, and the lower channel erosion will also decrease as the riverbed armors with coarser sediment. These, in combination with uncertain water discharge concomitant with climate change, increasing water demands and delta subsidence , will put the delta and coastal ocean at high environmental risks. In the context of global change, this work depicts a scenario of human impacts in the river basin that were transferred along the hydrological pathway to the coastal system and remotely transformed the different components of coastal environment. The synthesis review of the WSRS indicates that an integrated management of the river-coast continuum is crucially important for the sustainability of the entire river-delta system. The lessons learned from the WSRS in the Yellow River provide insights to the integrated management of large rivers worldwide. ]"

Because these steady disaster events would have deep implications on our knowledge of the history of Rome, we reviewed the pluridisciplinary data available at the Tiber River mouth. Considering sedimentological, geomorphological, micropalaeontological, geochemical, chronological and historical evidence, there is currently no conclusive palaeoenvironmental evidence to suggest past tsunami inundations near Ostia . River mouths are not the best context in which to identify tsunami deposits . High fluvial and coastal mobility generated by regular floods and storms hardly record single High-Energy Events (HEE) from floods, storms, or tsunamis. Sediments are regularly reworked at the river mouth both in the river channel and on the close shoreface. Mixed fluvial and marine influences and the seasonal formation of a salt wedge at the mouth of the Tiber create specific estuarine assemblages for micro- and macrofauna . The layer called High-Energy Event 1 (HEE-1) on the palaeo-shoreface close to the river mouth and HEE-4/5 in the point bars of the Tiber channel are most probably layers reworked several times by fluvio-coastal events (storms and/or floods). HEE-3 sealing the Republican harbour of Ostia is clearly related to flood deposits. Complementary analyses would be necessary to definitively identify the origins of the HEE-2 and HEE-7 in the harbour, and HEE-6 in the palaeochannel or floodplain. Based on the data available, we show how other processes than tsunami inundations could be just as accountable for these coarse-grained sediment layers (storm deposit, flood deposit, or riverbank deposit). This review puts into question the use of pluridisciplinary proxies to identify palaeotsunami deposits. In addition, we demonstrate how high Pb concentrations constitute a robust proxy to definitively refute the presence of palaeotsunami deposits. As such, this study will be beneficial to a large community of specialists in coastal research. ]"

Salt marshes in China face natural and anthropogenic threats. China has taken even tougher measures to conserve and restore salt marshes. Legal basis for wetland protection, more effective enforcement and public participation are needed. , Coastal salt marsh, one of the blue carbon ecosystems that can adapt and mitigate climate change influence, is drawing global attention due to its high carbon sequestration capability. In China, however, coastal salt marsh has suffered great losses. Nation-wide analysis of salt marsh trends and management is critical to ecosystem protection and restoration. Thus, by analyzing previous coastal salt marsh studies, we found that the extent of coastal salt marsh varied greatly among the Liao River Delta , the Yellow River Delta, the middle coast of Jiangsu Province, Chongming Dongtan and Jiuduansha in Shanghai, with a 59% overall loss of salt marsh extent from the 1980s to the 2010s. The rate of salt marsh loss slowed down after the year 2000. Coastal land-claim (reclamation) is the most dominant driver of salt marsh loss. Climate change and coastal erosion , invasive species , and vegetation dynamics driven by competition and succession have also led to various effects on salt marsh extent and the ecological services they provide. Sea level rise , reclamation pressure and environmental pollution are the main factors, as negative drivers, together with conservation and restoration policies, as positive ones, affecting future trends in salt marshes. China has implemented several measures to protect and restore salt marshes, such as setting up protected areas, drawing marine ecological redline, and making strict regulations on reclamation. However, stronger legal protection for wetlands , more effective enforcement, and participation by local communities can further enhance salt marsh restoration, conservation and management. ]"

Downstream riverbed erosion is a dominant source of POC to the coastal margin. Dam regulation has substantially transformed the POC delivery during the WSRS. , The Yellow River has changed into a highly dam-controlled system over the recent decades. Based on gauging records of water-sediment discharge and particulate organic carbon (POC) datasets, this paper investigates the dam impacts on spatio-temporal variability of hydrology and POC transport. With a large part of suspended sediment and POC normally preserved within the Xiaolangdi (XLD) reservoir, erosion of riverbed downstream the reservoir has now become a primary source of sediment and POC to coastal ocean (172 Mt/yr for sediment and 0.56 Mt/yr for POC, respectively). Sediment accumulation and POC burial within the XLD reservoir are 246 Mt/yr and 0.60 Mt/yr, respectively, globally accounting for ∼10% and ∼1% of the retentions in reservoirs. Downstream the XLD reservoir, the averaged Δ 14 C values of POC was −451 ± 25‰, corresponding to a 14 C age of 4763 ± 366 yr BP, indicating that the POC in the lower reaches of the Yellow River was ∼2400 yr younger than that in the Loess Plateau region where most of the sediment and POC are sourced. Petrogenic POC fluxes upstream and downstream the XLD dam were 0.12 Mt/yr and 0.06 Mt/yr, respectively, clearly indicative of large-scale trapping of petrogenic POC by the XLD dam. At present, the XLD dam regulation intercepts this petrogenic POC from the Loess Plateau and enhances the downstream input of biospheric POC ( Fm = 0.85) to the coast. In contrast to the sediment and POC delivery of the rivers worldwide that are primarily dominated by tectonic, climatic and geographic settings, human activities, especially the dam regulation in the Yellow River, have significantly altered river hydrologic regime and overwhelmed the sediment and POC delivery within the river-coast continuum, which has profound impacts on carbon cycling in the coastal margin. ]"

The DTC is often the correction with the largest errors over inland water regions. GPD and MPA are successful algorithms for retrieving the WTC over coastal zones. Both DTC and WTC require appropriate handling of their vertical variation. Over regions of sharp terrain, both DTC and WTC should be provided at high rate. , Satellite radar altimetry is nowadays a powerful and attractive Earth Observation technique of major importance in several applications such as the study of mean sea level change (a crucial climate change indicator), the observation of continental ice sheets' melting or the management of highly sensitive coastal zones and continental water resources. This paper aims at presenting an overview of the effects of the troposphere in satellite radar altimetry range observations, i.e. the tropospheric path delays (PD), and the corresponding corrections required to account for these effects, including those due to neutral gases, the DTC (dry tropospheric correction) and those related with water vapour and cloud liquid water content, the WTC (wet tropospheric correction). Starting with a summary of satellite altimeter missions since 1991 and corresponding relevant characteristics for DTC and WTC estimation, the tropospheric PD are discussed in the more general context of the atmospheric corrections. Then, for each of the tropospheric PD, the following topics are inspected and discussed: relevant background theory required to estimate each of the PD; methods used in the PD retrievals either from observations or from atmospheric models; specific problems encountered in the retrieval of each PD in coastal and inland water regions; errors still present in some altimeter products and proposed approaches to mitigate them. Most relevant conclusions are highlighted, including the future challenges and trends in DTC and WTC estimation. ]"

The detailed study of the sedimentary architecture and stacking pattern permitted separation of the pile into five depositional units bounded by erosional surfaces and characterised by separate facies associations (genetic sequences = units in this paper). At the base of the series, aeolian deposits (Unit 1) mark the development of a possible coastal desert during the late Miocene aridification. The major Pliocene sea-level rise (Transgressive Systems Tract) led to the drowning of the continental platform into a discrete shoreface–foreshore sequence (Unit 2), followed by an expanded deltaic sequence (Unit 3) that represents the main outcrop of the area. The sedimentary fabric of this prograding wedge during the Highstand Systems Tract reveals laterally stacked pluri-hectometic mouth bars built by the abrupt switching of a bird-foot delta during the Pliocene highstand. The clinoforms are deeply incised by submarine gullies filled both by periodic river-driven turbidite and tidal currents (Unit 4) during the coeval growing of the delta. The topset of the prograding wedge and associated gullies infill is truncated by an overall erosional unconformity that marks the widespread development of an extensive braid-delta system (Unit 5) during the lower Pleistocene sea-level drop (Lowstand Systems Tract). The last 6 m of the Braid-delta unit is overprinted by a ferallitic profile, forming the surface of the plateau and indicating long-term subaerial exposure and weathering processes consistent with the maximum warming of the middle to late Pleistocene interglacial periods. The successive abrupt shifts of the depositional systems through the sedimentary pile indicate a high-amplitude sea level amplified by major coastal uplifts and the reorganisation of the fluvial network. In this context, the palaeo-Cuanza prograding wedge signals the westward tilting and 60 m total uplift of the coastal plain during the Pliocene. A new uplift pulse by differential tilt and slope increase is deduced from the widespread development of the braid-delta complex during the early Pleistocene. The last tectonic event corresponds to the 80- to 100-m uplift and ferallitic paedogenesis during the middle to late Pleistocene interglacial stages. ]"

Most classifications of deltas have focused on subaerial plan morphology as a simplistic function of river, tide, and wave energy. New work, however, is revealing the importance of subaqueous deposits, and in particular shore-parallel sediment redistribution, in the shaping of delta planform. Delta asymmetry has emerged as an important characteristic reflective of patterns of alongshore sediment dispersal. Asymmetry has been described from onshore and offshore environments from several different types of modern deltas, but aspects of asymmetry have not been fully documented and the degree to which these patterns are recorded in deltaic strata is not yet known. This study is a comprehensive literature review of sediment distributions in modern deltas focusing on studies with high resolution geomorphic, geophysical, and geochronological datasets. We reviewed 27 deltas using over 100 papers primarily from the past 15–20 years. Morphological, facies, and stratigraphic aspects were analyzed across the entire spectrum of deposits from the delta apex to the most distal muds of the prodelta. We define quantifiable indices of asymmetry describing upcurrent vs. downcurrent distribution of sediment volume, sediment area, sediment caliber, and distributary channels. Most deltas are asymmetrical to some degree with respect to one or more of these parameters. Many deltas are increasingly skewed toward the downcurrent side from proximal to distal sub-environments (i.e. delta plain, delta front, prodelta). Some deltas are skewed toward the upcurrent side in one sub-environment and toward the downcurrent side in another sub-environment. Sand is preferentially deposited on the downcurrent side of most deltas, but distributary channels tend to develop toward the upcurrent side. The highest sand:mud ratios are often on the upcurrent side in the lower delta plain, but in the delta front these ratios are highest on the downcurrent side. These complex patterns of asymmetry reflect different combinations of controls including discharge partitioning, lobe abandonment and localized transgression, plume deflection by coastal currents, dominance of longshore current direction, variable subsidence, and other factors. These processes may result in upcurrent–downcurrent variations in clinoform geometry, rates of progradation, and stratal lapping relationships. Asymmetry has multiple aspects, manifestations, and controls – even within a single delta – but the long-term preservation potential of these patterns likely varies, depending on depositional setting and shoreline trajectory. Studies of ancient deltas will be better-informed by recognizing the wide variety of controls on sediment distribution and avoiding the tendency toward a single model of delta asymmetry. ]"

The prognosis for people near coastlines and waterways is particularly dire without decisive actions that capitalize on shared strengths such as ecosystems. One clear opportunity is the regenerative services and co-benefits of natural infrastructure that reduce the impacts of environmental disasters as magnified by climatic change. Certainly, nature-based solutions are increasingly being viewed as critical actions to reduce societal risk. However, to advance the use of natural infrastructure through eco-engineering, there is a need to clarify the science regarding risk reduction effectiveness, develop agreeable principles, standards, and designs, and grow a demonstration site network responsive to circumstances faced by communities around the globe. In addition, there is a need to consider the legal, policy, and regulatory obstacles and opportunities for natural infrastructure within local to national contexts (i.e., science-based building codes, architectural design criteria, incentive policies, etc.). Ultimately, the integration of science, designs, and policy coupled with installation within several global resource management processes (IWRM, ICZM , etc.) will help establish eco-engineering standards. Supportive coastal, river, and urban examples from around the world are used to illustrate the current state of knowledge, model this integration of science, design, and policy, serve as initial “benchmark site”, and finally help define guiding principles for the emerging field of eco-engineering. ]"

The authors suggest that further studies be carried out under anaerobic conditions. , Sensitive biomes, such as coastal ecosystems , have become increasingly susceptible to environmental impacts caused by oil logistics and storing, which, although more efficient nowadays, still cause spills. Thus, bioremediation techniques attract attention owing to their low impact on the environment. Among petroleum-based compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known for their potential impact and persistence in the environment. Therefore, PAH bioremediation is notably a technique capable of reducing these polluting compounds in the environment. However, there is a lack of understanding of microbial growth process conditions, leading to a less efficient choice of bioremediation methods. This article provides a review of the bioremediation processes in mangroves contaminated with oils and PAHs and an overview of some physicochemical and biological factors. Special attention was given to the lack of approach regarding experiments that have been conducted in situ and that considered the predominance of the anaerobic condition of mangroves. ]"

Lack of temporal monitoring data on seagrass trends. The inclusion of cumulative impacts to management frameworks is a priority. , Management is failing to adequately protect coastal ecosystems . Here we reviewed the policies, legislation, plans and management frameworks intended to protect seagrass meadows in 20 case-studies with the aim of identifying critical gaps in seagrass protection. The case-studies were chosen to represent a range of regions known to have high cumulative impacts or outstanding seagrass management. We asked five ‘key questions’ in our review to identify gaps in seagrass protection: 1) are seagrass habitats identified as an ecosystem of environmental significance, 2) what are their main threats, 3) does management consider cumulative impacts and 4) multiple pressures, and 5) are these habitats recovering? Seagrass protection was enacted inconsistently, through a range of legislative, policy and planning processes that only sought to mitigate some of the known pressures. Although the importance of preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services were acknowledged in over 80% of the case-studies, actionable plans to specifically address known pressures were lacking. Poor integration across jurisdictional realms and sectoral management approaches prevented the holistic strategy needed to address multiple pressures. We suggest a priority for enhancing protection of seagrass ecosystems is improving legislation, policies and planning frameworks to consider multiple pressures and cumulative impacts from marine and land-based activities. Management of seagrass ecosystems is likely to be indicative of trends in coastal management more generally, highlighting the urgent need to address multiple pressures and cumulative impacts in legislation and policies. ]"

Here, a database-driven quantitative statistical analysis of 87 late-Quaternary incised-valley fills (IVFs) has been undertaken to assess the general validity and predictive value of classical facies models for IVFs, and to investigate the relative importance of possible controls on their stratigraphic organization. Based on datasets from the published literature stored in a sedimentological database, the geometry and proportion of systems tracts, and of architectural elements of different hierarchies within IVFs are quantified. These variables were analysed to assess how they vary in relation to parameters that represent potential controlling factors: relative sea-level stage, continental-margin type, drainage-basin area, valley geometry, basin physiography and shoreline hydrodynamics. The stratigraphic organization of the studied coastal-plain IVFs is generally consistent with that represented in facies models, the primary control being the rate and magnitude of relative sea-level change. However, results from this study demonstrate significant variability in the stratigraphic architectures of IVFs, which is not accounted for by existing models. Variations in the facies architecture of coastal-plain and cross-shelf valley fills can be attributed to controls other than sea level, and expressed in relationships with continental-margin type, basin physiography, catchment area , river-system size and shoreline hydrodynamics. The following primary findings arise from this research. (i) Compared to their counterparts on passive margins, coastal-plain IVFs hosted on active margins contain, on average, a higher proportion of fluvial deposits and a lower proportion of central-basin estuarine deposits; estuarine deposits tend however to be thicker. This suggests a control on IVF stratigraphic architecture exerted by distinct characteristics of the tectonic setting of the host continental margins, notably basin physiography, rates and mode of sediment supply, and nature of sediment load. (ii) The thickness and proportion of lowstand systems tract are positively correlated with coastal-plain IVF dimensions, likely reflecting the role of drainage-basin area in dictating the scale of the fluvial systems that carved and infilled the valleys. (iii) Positive correlations are observed between the thickness of fluvial deposits, bayhead-delta deposits and central-basin estuarine deposits, versus coastal-plain IVF dimensions and valley catchment area. This suggests a control exerted by the river-system scale on sediment-supply rates and on the accommodation determined by valley size. (iv) Positive correlations between the thickness and proportion of barrier-complex deposits within cross-shelf IVFs versus mean shelf gradient indicate that the geometry of the shelf might control the establishment and preservation of barrier-island environments in incised valleys located on the shelf. (v) Correlations between the width of coastal-plain IVFs and present-day mean tidal range at the shoreline indicate that tidal dynamics may contribute to the widening of the incised valleys. Positive correlation is observed between the proportion of tide-dominated elements in highstand IVF deposits and IVF width, suggesting possible effects of interplays between hydrodynamic conditions and the geometry of incised valleys on their infills . This study highlights the complexity of the internal fills of incised valleys, which must be considered when attempting the application of facies models of IVFs to rock-record interpretations or as predictive tools in subsurface studies. ]"

Results show that the ONSET SST data are suitable for numerical model evaluation, and provide relevant information in addition to satellite and reanalysis data at seasonal cycle. The minor and major coastal upwellings are present in all the products. The inter-annual SST variability is more pronounced in the western part of the region (Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana) than in the eastern part (Benin and Nigeria). The pattern differences between the west and the east of the region highlight a large spatial variability of the SST in the NGoG. Indeed, the signal of the minor upwelling season is visible only in the west of the basin, namely between Cape Palmas and Cape Three Points. We also observe a well-established thermal gradient between the western and eastern parts of the basin. This gradient is increasing from west to east during the major upwelling season, and decreasing from east to west during the rest of the year. The coastal ONSET data allow to evidence higher SST anomalies than those deduced from satellite and reanalysis products. Although the cold or warm events observed in 2008, 2010 and 2012 are well detected by all products, only the ONSET data set reveal the strong negative SST anomaly observed in 2009 along the coast of Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. ]"

Nebkhas are very widespread in dry and coastal environments. They have considerable importance because they can be ‘islands of fertility’ and have major hydrological and biological effects. They can, if eroded, be major sources of dust emission. Examples of coastal nebkhas are known from both temperate areas and from lower latitude drylands, as along the Caspian shoreline in Iran, Kuwait, northern Peru, Namibia, Western Sahara, the Makran, southwest Madagascar, and Mauritania. Dryland nebkhas have been described from numerous areas, with concentrations of studies in Kuwait, the southwest USA, northwest China, and Iran. Within an area with suitable climatic conditions, nebkhas do not occur everywhere. Certain conditions need to be met for their development and these are illustrated with examples from the Tarim and Qaidam basins of China, the Lut of Iran, northwest Argentina, and the Namib. For this, Google Earth was employed. The heights of these features range from a matter of centimeters to as much as 20 m. There is a considerable quantity of data on the plants that are associated with the development of nebkhas. They have to have certain qualities for this role: ability to withstand drought, tolerate salt, thrive on sand burial, have wide shallow rooting systems to obtain water from fog and occasional rain events, extract moisture from groundwater, withstand sand abrasion, and develop adventitious roots . Although nebkhas are normally thought of as a type of sand dune, and most nebkhas are indeed composed of sand-sized material, largely consisting of quartz, there are many nebkhas which contain appreciable amounts of silt and clay, as well as salts such as gypsum . Although some nebkhas are ephemeral features, various dating techniques have shown that they can be decades, centuries and even millennia old. ]"

We performed geochronological, sedimentological, micromorphological and mineralogical investigations on the deposits forming the different paleo-surfaces between Civitavecchia and Anzio towns, in order to provide chronostratigraphical, paleogeographical and paleoenvironmental constraints. Using the newly achieved dataset we correlate these paleo-surfaces with the coastal terraces formed during past sea-level highstands , as recognized by previous studies, and we refine their correlation with the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) timescale.

Vitamin B 12 B 12 auxotrophy is widespread in the marine microbial community not being linked to any species lineage. Knowledge about the role of this organic compound on the control of the structure, composition and growth of natural marine microbial assemblages is scarce, but recent studies carried out in shelf waters off NW Iberian Peninsula have demonstrated that growth of phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria can be affected by the availability of this vitamin. Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been set up as an analytical tool for the first direct determination of vitamin B 12 B 12 present in these coastal waters enabling the separation of two different B 12 B 12 analogs: hydroxocobalamin (HyB 12 ) and cyanocobalamin (CyB 12 ). In this study, samples were collected from shelf (coastal station) and shelf-break waters of the NW Iberian Peninsula in February, April and August 2016 in order to encompass both the spatial and temporal variability of vitamin B 12 B 12 concentrations in seawater . Concentrations of dissolved vitamin B 12 B 12 varied from 0.15 pM, at the shelf-break station, to 2.7 pM at the coastal station, HyB 12 being the most abundant congener.

Mussels were the most common bivalve across experiments which reflect their high abundance and broad distribution in the field. Although fibres are the dominant shape of MPs in coastal systems, most studies focus on spherules and beads, and MP concentrations are often orders of magnitude higher than environmental levels.

However, there are limits to the information that fish can provide on connectivity. Mangrove-bird communities have the potential to connect coastal habitats in different ways and at different scales than fish, so incorporation of these links into our models of coastal ecosystem mosaics affords the opportunity to greatly increase the breadth of our understanding. We review the habitat and foraging requirements of mangrove-bird functional groups to understand how bird use of mangroves facilitates biological connectivity in coastal ecosystem mosaics, and how that connectivity adds to the diversity and complexity of ecological processes in mangrove ecosystems. Avian biological connectivity is primarily characterized by foraging behavior and habitat/resource requirements. Therefore, the consequence of bird links for coastal ecosystem functioning largely depends on patterns of habitat use and foraging, and potentially influences nutrient cycling, top–down control and genetic information linkage. Habitats that experience concentrated bird guano deposition have high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, placing particular importance on the consequences of avian nutrient translocation and subsidization for coastal ecosystem functioning. High mobility allows mangrove-bird communities to link mangrove forests to other mangrove, terrestrial and marine-pelagic systems. Therefore, the spatial scale of coastal connectivity facilitated by birds is substantially more extensive than fish-facilitated connectivity. In particular, migratory birds link habitats at regional, continental and inter-continental scales as they travel among seasonally available feeding areas from breeding grounds to non-breeding grounds; scales at which there are few fish equivalents. Knowledge of the nature and patterns of fish connectivity have contributed to shifting the initial, historical perception of mangrove-ecosystem functioning from that of a simple system based on nutrient and energy retention, to a view that includes fish-facilitated energy export. In a similar way, understanding the nature and implications of mangrove connectivity through bird movements and migrations affords new possibilities for revising our view of the extent of functional links between mangroves and other ecosystems. ]"

Although the present status of shorelines is strongly influenced by the direct and indirect impacts of human activities, especially over the past century, the palaeoenvironmental dimension of shorelines shows the primacy of “naturally” forced processes in shoreline development. There are several examples of naturally changing sedimentary and sea-level conditions that have determined patterns of human settlement and development. Changes in sedimentation induced by tectonics have sometimes led to the demise of such settlements, as in the case of the ancient port fortress of Pelusium on the Nile delta coast of Egypt. Indirect human influence on coastal sediment occurs through changes in forest cover and land use. Documented examples of direct human engineering on shore processes that have left a palaeoenvironmental imprint are few. These examples show, however, how human intervention has influenced past shoreline development, notably in ancient port settings in the Mediterranean. More recent examples involve empoldering of coastal wetlands in Europe during the Middle Ages. ]"

However, this information gets blurred by post-depositional processes. Here, we document post-depositional alteration processes that affected an onshore tsunami deposit from its deposition in February 2010 until 2014. Post-depositional changes proceeded in three stages. First, the thickness was reduced by 20% within the first months because of erosion by runoff. Second, vegetation returned and bioturbation destroyed the sedimentary structures and obliterated the basal contact. The thickness was reduced further to 20–40% of its initial thickness. The mean grain size decreased as silt and mud from the enclosing soil horizons were mixed into the deposit. Finally, as post-seismic subsidence together with damming by a coastal dune transformed the coastal plain into a wetland, aqueous microbial magnetite reduction set in and dissolved up to 57% of the magnetite . Inverse models are used to reconstruct onshore tsunami flow parameters in order to quantify the intensity of ancient events. Thickness, grain size and bulk density are input parameters to any model. Thus, post-depositional processes affect the reliability of the modeled flow parameters. Of the three documented processes, the post-depositional alteration of the grain size has the highest influence, followed by the reduction of the thickness. The change of the bulk density hardly had any effect. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the calculated flow velocity decreased by 60% from 4.2 m/s for the pristine sediments to 2.5 m/s for the altered deposits. Consequently, inverse models will significantly underestimate tsunami intensity because of the alteration of the deposits. ]"

This article reviews prawn and shrimp farming in coastal Bangladesh that have been linked to a “green economy”. As part of agricultural development in coastal Bangladesh, prawn and shrimp farming were initiated in the 1970s. Over the last three decades, prawn and shrimp culture have undergone a revolutionary development in coastal Bangladesh. Pawn and shrimp farming have brought about widespread social and economic benefits. However, a wide range of environmental issues including climate change have recently been identified to threaten the sustainability of coastal aquaculture. In order to achieve a green economy, environmental challenges must be addressed in translating its benefits effectively to the millions of coastal poor. Considering the extreme vulnerability to the effects of climate change , an integrated green economy system needs to be introduced to cope with the challenges. Effective planning in respect to coastal zone management would also be given particular attention. ]"

Vertical patterns of MPs were summarized in freshwater system, coastal waters and pelagic zone . Harmonized sampling methods were urgently needed and transport mechanisms were discussed. , There have been numerous studies that have investigated floating microplastics (MPs) in surface water, yet little data are currently available regarding the vertical distribution in the water column. This lack constrains our ability to comprehensively assess the ecological effects of MPs and develop further policy controls. In this study, we reviewed current progress of sampling methodologies, the distribution patterns, and the physiochemical properties of MPs throughout the water column. Three sampling protocols were identified in this study: bulk, net and submersible pump/in-situ sampling. In different regions, the vertical patterns of MPs in the water column varied with depth, which is possibly related to the morphological characteristics, polymeric densities, and biofouling of the MPs. The results of this review revealed that fibrous and fragmented MPs comprised over 90% of the total MPs by quantity, of which fibrous MPs constituted the majority (43%–100%). In addition, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, and polypropylene have been widely identified in previous studies. To minimize the impact caused by various sampling protocols, the use of a volume gradient trail experiment and a unified mesh size of 60–100 μm for the initial concentration are recommended according to the results of this review. Given the limited knowledge regarding the vertical transport of MPs in the water column, harmonized sampling methods should first be developed. The mechanisms of this process can be separately considered for different water bodies, such as freshwater systems, coastal waters, and pelagic zones. The presence of these anthropogenic pollutants in the water column poses a threat to the largest but most vulnerable habitats of life on earth, and hence they merit further investigation. ]"

Diverse responses are planned and/or implemented in the Western Indian Ocean small islands. Most responses are governmental, linked to policies and regulatory measures. Increasing interest in ecological restoration and community-based responses. Response effectiveness depends on context, funding, time, knowledge and governance. , Tropical small islands are particularly vulnerable to environmental impacts. In the small islands of the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), multiple stressors of environmental and socio-economic change interact and intensify at reduced spatial scales . Actors and institutions need to respond to these changes through responses – reactive or proactive actions planned or implemented by individuals, groups or organisations; aimed at responding to changing contexts and scenarios, by reducing, preventing and/or reverting the risks and impacts of environmental change. Through a mixed-method systematic review of academic literature from 2010 to 2020 using the Web of Science literature database, we document the types of responses, actors involved and elements of effective responses. We analysed 329 studies focusing on nine WIO small island states and territories (SISTs) – Zanzibar, Mafia, Seychelles, Comoros, Mayotte, La Réunion, Mauritius, Maldives and Lakshadweep. Using quantitative content analysis, we organised information into categories ranging from institutional (economic instruments, laws, policies and community based), social (educational and informational), infrastructural (engineered and technological) and ecological restoration-based responses. The articles varied in their geographical distribution , focus and depth with regard to the responses studied. Diverse responses are documented, that often overlap across categories and may be combined and pursued simultaneously. For example, responses range from coastal protection structures, land reclamation , land elevation and artificial islands to mangrove restoration, awareness raising programs, coastal zone regulations and climate induced migration and relocation policies. Responses were predominantly institutional (85% of 329 articles, n = 281) – mainly driven by governments. The most common social responses (53%, n = 183) were linked to environmental education programs and knowledge sharing platforms. Although the responses indicated an increasing interest in ecological restoration (27%, n = 91) and community-based initiatives (36%, n = 120), they were largely underrepresented in research. Cataloguing the different responses may help incorporate the diversity into well-informed decisions, offer alternative ways of thinking and highlight specific areas and response types that should be the focus of future research and practice. The elements influencing the effectiveness of responses were identified through thematic synthesis – relevance to the local social-ecological context, resources available (time and funding), knowledge (access, diversity, integration, transfer, innovative and anticipatory), governance of responses (coordinated, transparent, adaptive, equitable, participatory and polycentric) and iterative monitoring. These elements of effectiveness tend to be synergistic and no single element is effective in isolation. When these elements are not considered, the response intervention could be maladaptive or counterproductive. Poorly designed responses result in perverse social and ecological outcomes, further increasing the exposure and vulnerability to the environmental stressors and decreasing public confidence and support. This review documents current literature, points to knowledge gaps and highlights the potential for islands to learn from each other and to further apply these lessons to non-island settings, critically considering the local context. ]"

Features of elemental composition of urban soils were established. Urban soils are polluted by elements of their deep soil horizons. Specific behavior of rare-earth elements in technogenesis soils were revealed. , In anthropogenic soils of Sochi (the Black Sea coast, humid subtropical zone of Russia), the acid-alkali properties are transformed in comparison with natural soils (Haplic Acrisols (Clayic)). The pH-water index shifted from 5.8 to 7.5 (average values for the genetic horizons of soils), alkali saturation increased 1.3 times in the upper horizon (from 72.9 to 97.7%) and 1.5 times (from 64.8 to 97.3 %) in the middle clay argic horizon. Assessment of chemical elements contents (61 elements analyzed) in the soils of different landscapes of Sochi in comparison with their concentrations in natural soils revealed the following. Pollutants, the contents of which must be controlled when monitoring urban soils, are: Cu, Ni, Cd and, additionally, on low relief elements: Cs, Ga, Be, Rb, V, Li, as well as 9 rare-earth elements (REE): Dy, Tb, Sm, Ho, Eu, Gd, Sc, Y, Er. The total pollution index (total above-background content of chemical elements) for urban soils is not large. According to the most typical urban relief elements, in the watershed – slope – sea coastline system, the index is distributed as follows – permissible pollution on the slope, moderately hazardous pollution on the flat surface adjacent to the slope, and dangerous pollution in the coastal zone on the territory of sanatoriums. Sochi coastal sanatorium zone requires detailed monitoring in order to identify areas with extremely dangerous contamination of the soil that needs to be recultivated. ]"

Net pen aquaculture often overlaps with lobster habitat and fisheries. Some finfish aquaculture stressors impact juveniles more than adult lobsters. Local oceanography, farm production, chemical use, and proximity to key habitat define impacts. Existing assessment tools and ecosystem-based management could help avoid negative interactions. , Globally, lobsters are one of the most economically valuable wild species caught in capture fisheries. Catches are dominated by American lobster ( Homarus americanus) landed entirely in Atlantic Canada and northeastern United States. In Atlantic Canada, lobster fishing and marine finfish aquaculture take place in the same coastal waters creating the potential for negative environmental, as well as social, interactions. We review the state of knowledge of environmental interactions between American lobster, their habitat and fishery, and marine finfish aquaculture. We first provide a brief overview of key biological, behavioural, and ecological processes and environmental stressors of American lobster at different life-history stages followed by an overview of the pathways of effects of marine finfish aquaculture on coastal ecosystems in general and on American lobster. Our review found that certain finfish aquaculture-lobster interactions have received considerable study (e.g., chemical use), whereas knowledge of other interactions are either limited (e.g., net pens, waste discharges) or lacking (e.g., disease, noise, lights, and odours). An ecosystem-based approach to aquaculture has been proposed for managing these interactions but implementing this approach has proven to be a challenge in part because of complex multi-sector, multi-stakeholder and multi-agency governance issues. While governance solutions await development, practical measures based on the results of scientific research identified in this review, such as better use of existing oceanographic and bathymetric data, habitat and human impact assessment tools, and toxicity information offer regulators ample information and management tools, at least at the farm- and bay-scale, to avoid negative finfish aquaculture-lobster interactions in Atlantic Canada. Bridging the governance gap will likely require new community-based management models that more effectively identify, generate, and integrate local community and fisher knowledge and concerns. ]"

Understanding the impact of these processes on shoreline–shelf morphodynamics and stratigraphic preservation remains challenging. Numerical modelling integrated with traditional facies analysis provides an increasingly viable approach, with the potential to quantify, and thereby improve understanding of, the impact of these complex coastal sedimentary processes. An integrated approach is presented here that focuses on palaeotidal modelling to investigate the controls on ancient tides and their influence on sedimentary deposition and preservation – one of the three cornerstones of the ternary process classification scheme of shoreline-shelf systems. Numerical tidal modelling methodology is reviewed and illustrated in three palaeotidal model case studies of different scales and focus. The results are synthesised in the context of shoreline–shelf processes, including a critique and modification of the process-based classification scheme. The emphasis on tidal processes reflects their global importance throughout Earth’s history. Ancient palaeotidal models are able to highlight and quantify the following four controls on tidal processes: (1) the physiography (shape and depth) of oceans (1000s km scale) determines the degree of tidal resonance; (2) the physiography of ocean connections to partly enclosed water bodies (100–1000s km scale) determines the regional-scale flux of tidal energy (inflow versus outflow); (3) the physiography of continental shelves influences shelf tidal resonance potential; and (4) tides in relatively local-scale embayments (typically 1–10s km scale) are influenced by the balance of tidal amplification due to funnelling, shoaling and resonance effects versus frictional damping. In deep time, palaeogeographic and palaeobathymetric uncertainty can be accounted for in palaeotidal models by performing sensitivity analyses to different scenarios, across this range of spatial scales. These tidal process controls are incorporated into an updated predictive decision tree for determining shoreline–shelf process regime in terms of the relative interaction of wave, fluvial and tidal processes. The predictive decision tree considers the effects of basin physiography, shelf width and shoreline morphology on wave, fluvial and tidal processes separately. Uncertainty and ambiguity in applying the widely used three-tier process classification scheme are reduced by using the decision tree in conjunction with a proposed two-tier classification of process regime that is limited to primary and secondary processes. This two-tier classification scheme is illustrated in the three case studies, showing how integration of numerical modelling with facies analysis of the preserved stratigraphic record improves confidence in prediction of tide-influenced shoreline-shelf process regimes. Wider application of this approach will further improve process-based classifications and predictions of modern and ancient shoreline–shelf systems. ]"

Desalination activities are one of the major marine pollution drivers regionally and internationally. Arabian Gulf countries represent a hotspot of desalination activities as they are responsible for nearly 50% of the global desalination capacity. Building desalination plants, up-taking seawater , and discharging untreated brine back into the sea adversely affects the biodiversity of the marine ecosystems . The present review attempted to reveal the potential negative effects of desalination plants on the Gulf's marine environments.

The limited knowledge generated to date in this topic has been primarily focused on those areas attaining a high population density, and rarely deals with long-term (&gt;50 years) dynamics. Here we present the first Holocene palaeoecological study carried in the Orinoco Delta, in NE Venezuela. The record presented here contains sediments from the last 6200 years and is located in a river-shore swamp dominated by the palm Mauritia flexuosa . Current human occupation is almost restricted to small settlements of the Warao indigenous culture, closely related to the use of M. flexuosa and other palm species present in the zone. The results show the occurrence of three well-distinguished palynological zones: (i) from 6200 to 5200 cal yr BP, characterised by mixed rainforest and other taxa related to salinity (coastal-like), low (negative) values of magnetic susceptibility and magnetic grain size, absence of transported clays, and the highest macrocharcoal particles abundance; (ii) from 5200 to 2950 cal yr BP, marked by a replacement of the mangrove-like vegetation by a more inland mixed-swamp forest community with low levels of charcoal, and (iii) from 2950 cal yr BP to present-day, characterised by the establishment of the current vegetation community, dominated by M. flexuosa , and an increasing trend in the charcoal curve since the last 700 years. A combination of regional (climatic changes) and local (sediment ontogeny) has been proposed as the key drivers influencing the vegetation succession recorded. The stabilisation of the sea-level that occurred during the mid-Holocene would have favoured the transgression of the coastal line, with the migration of the coastal-like vegetation seawards. Synchronous to this event, a trend towards drier conditions has been reported in the close Cariaco record, that could have also influenced the vegetation replacement. Between 3800 and 2800 years ago, the increased ENSO variability registered in Cariaco may have played a key role in the expansion of the Mauritia palm community. It is suggested that in our location, the potential inhabiting human populations were differently influenced by these environmental changes. First, the disappearance of the coastal resources could have favoured land abandonment, whereas the increase in the abundance of the palm might be influential for the arrival of other inland cultures that were previously used to manage Mauritia . This sequence shows the importance of the ecosystem services for the location inhabitants, highlighting the abandonment of the mid-Holocene culture coeval with the disappearance of its ecosystem. These results also provide information about the sensitivity and resilience in facing external stressors of both humans and vegetation, and will be valuable tools for managing the future of this ecosystem. ]"

New data on coastal erosion and riverine sediment load into the subaqueous delta were proposed. A sediment budget for the subaqueous delta of the modern Red River was constructed. The surficial sediment coarsening in the northern part of the delta front is occurring. , A mass balance for sediment in the subaqueous delta of the modern Red River has been constructed to identify major sources, sinks, and the magnitude of sediment available for export to the adjacent coastal zone. The Red River is the largest sediment source in the subaqueous delta, and its input amounts to 63.957 ± 6.935 Mt/yr (Mt = = 10 6 tonnes) with about 91.39% contribution of the total sediment inputs. Contributions from the atmosphere (0.004 ± 0.001 Mt/yr), the coastal erosion (1.124 ± 0.112 Mt/yr), the anthropogenic input (4.550 ± 0.339 Mt/yr), the primary production (0.114 ± 0.039 Mt/yr) and the seabed erosion (0.232 ± 0.044 Mt/yr) account for only 8.61% of the total input. About 47.72% of total sediment inputs has been deposited in the subaqueous delta. The remaining 52.28%, primarily from the dissolved load (54%) of the Red River, is believed to have been transported southward by the dominant southward flow along the coastline. These results confirm earlier evidence indicating that most of particulate matter from the Red River is deposited close to the river mouth. Comparing accumulation rates over different timescales suggests that the inverse relationship between long- and short-term accumulation rates is the result of the changing balance of sedimentation and erosion processes. Under present conditions we believe that the surficial sediment coarsening in the northern part of the delta front is the result of a combination of the decreasing sediment load of the Red River basin and the dominant southward flow along the coastline This makes contribution to the subaqueous delta change from sedimentation to erosion status. These findings contribute to our understanding of sediment movement within the subaqueous delta, and may also provide a baseline for the evaluation and comparison of future anthropogenic or natural change in the subaqueous delta of the Red River. ]"

Any negative impacts of climate change (CC) on inlet environment are therefore very likely to result in significant socio-economic impacts. CC driven variations in mean water level (i.e. SLR), wave conditions and riverflow are likely to affect the stability of, particularly, the thousands of Small Tidal Inlets (STIs, or bar-built/barrier estuary systems) around the world. The combination of their predominant occurrence in developing countries, socio-economic relevance and low community resilience, general lack of data, and high sensitivity to seasonal forcing makes STIs potentially very vulnerable to CC impacts . This article summarises potential CC impacts on the stability of STIs and discusses means by which these CC impacts maybe quantified using existing modelling tools. As presently available process based models cannot be confidently applied with concurrent time varying water level, wave and riverflow forcing over typical CC impact assessment time scales (~ 100 years), a ‘snap-shot’ simulation (~ 1 year duration) approach using process based coastal area morphodyamic models is proposed for qualitative assessments of CC impacts on STIs. As the modelling approach will by necessity depend on the level of data availability, two different ‘snap-shot’ modelling frameworks for ‘data rich’ and ‘data poor’ environments are presented. Process based multi-scale coastal area morphodynamic models and scale aggregated (or reduced complexity) morphodynamic models are identified as modelling approaches that may be pursued in the future to obtain more reliable assessments of CC impacts on STI stability. ]"

As such, it is critically important to numerically simulate TC activity (and other phenomenon) on local scales in order to properly assess climate change impacts on natural hazards in the region. In addition, projecting future changes of many TC-related hazards and/or their potential economic impacts can be challenging due to their low occurrence frequencies in any one particular area.

Since then, reforestation, river bed quarrying, land reclamations, dams constructions triggered severe erosion. Hard structures were soon built, somewhere transforming a sandy coast in a rocky one, with impact on tourism activity. Beach fill grew in the late XX cent., but some negative results and sand shortage are pushing for old strategies. As long as shore protection structures grow, beach erosion expands. , Beach erosion started to severely affect the Italian coast in the mid XIX century, mostly at river mouths where settlements were almost absent. When the problem reached developed areas a National law was enacted (1907) favoring defense of coastal settlements, which was mostly addressed through seawalls and revetments . In this way many coastal towns lost their beaches, which today could have a tourist and social function. In the following years, when the beach became an economic resource, groins and detached breakwaters were implemented, frequently triggering down drift erosion, therefore justifying more coastal rock structures. In some localities more than 200 groins or detached breakwaters (or both) are present in a few kilometers of coast. Coastal resilience, previously reduced by longshore urbanization, was definitely zeroed. Beach nourishment started to be carried out consistently in the ‘70s with quarried materials or sediment dredged in harbors or river mouths (for a total of approximately 10 M m 3 ). In the ‘90s marine aggregates commenced to be used in protected and in a few unprotected beach nourishment projects. Approximately 21 M m 3 have been emplaced since then. Difficulties in finding quarried material due to restrictions in opening new quarries for environmental reasons, as well as finding suitable continental shelf sediments, together with the economic crisis, caused a reduction of beach nourishment schemes in recent years. Unsatisfactory results of some projects, where sand was quickly lost or the project did not have the stakeholders' acceptance, are additional reasons for the reduction in beach nourishment projects. Designers are now much more confident with hard defenses, possibly with submerged breakwaters or groins, although many projects retrace the path of the '60s, proving that not all has been learned from past mistakes. This paper could serve as a warning for countries currently entering the process of coastal development. ]"

Soviet studies in the 1960–1970's showed that a well-defined sill north of the Bosphorus does not prevent the overflow of dense Mediterranean water onto the shelf even during unfavorable conditions (high surface elevation in the Black Sea and strong northerly winds). The stream makes a sharp westward turn after exiting from the strait and then starts its track downward to the shelf slope. Intensive dispersion of the Mediterranean water occurs at a distance of 25–50 km from the strait. Recent laboratory and mathematical models have been reviewed to describe the behavior of the density and current interfaces in the strait and the role of temporary blockage of the dense flow upon the Mediterranean effluent. Two hypothetic physical mechanisms for sill overflow are discussed. One is associated with bifurcation of the coastal flows, approaching the strait orifice, and formation of a diversion zone in the upper layer which facilitates the flow over the sill. Another hypothesis suggests that the sill exercises frictionless rotational hydraulic control in the short, 4 km continuation of the strait channel. Persistent northeasterly or southerly winds can substantially affect the intensity of the Mediterranean effluent by modifying the average flow fields and density structures in the strait. TS -analysis of far-field property distribution shows that the Mediterranean water contributes to the laminated structure of the Black Sea water column. Under average conditions, the Mediterranean waters follow the mainstream of the Black Sea current system along the Turkish coast, reaching the deepest strata in the southeastern corner of the sea. Ongoing Soviet diversions of fresh water from the northern slope of the Black Sea and projected damming of the major estuaries and the Azov Sea will intensify the Mediterranean effluent and, at the same time, will increase the vertical mixing due to more effective convective overturn. These phenomena will lead to partial or complete disappearance of the H 2 S layer and general warming of the water column. ]"

We studied daily variations in productivity at a nearshore station (25m depth) off Dichato, Chile (36°30′S) during January 1986 to understand how wind-driven variability in the hydrography is translated into pulses of primary and secondary production of the plankton. During the study period, we observed three complete cycles of upwelling favourable/unfavourable winds. Water column destratification, as indicated by the surface-to-bottom gradient of sigma-t, lagged the wind by about one day. During active upwelling, cold water (&lt;11.5°C) of high nitrate and low oxygen concentration (20–25μM and 1–2ml 1 −1 respectively) was found near the surface. During subsequent relaxation of upwelling, the water column became stratified as temperature, oxygen and chlorophyll increased. The size and taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton varied from one event to the next. Over the course of the study, from 15–100% of the chlorophyll could pass a 20μm mesh screen. Chain-forming diatoms, microflagellates, and the autotrophic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum dominated the first, second and third events, respectively. In rank order of abundance, Paracalanus parvus, Centropages brachiatus, Oithona spp., Acartia tonsa, Oncaea spp., Calanoides patagoniensis and Calanus chilensis dominated the copepod community. Changes in abundance of most species did not closely follow the upwelling cycle. Possibly, vertical movements or other behavioural responses caused zooplankton distributions to be uncorrelated with movements of the surface Ekman layer. Fecundity of several of the important copepod species was measured using the egg ratio and bottle incubation techniques. Compared to values reported in the literature, egg production was usually suboptimal, despite high nutritional quality of the phytoplankton, as indicated by protein/carbohydrate ratios. Food availability, due to either small phytoplankton size or spatial and temporal uncoupling of phyto- and zooplankton populations, was probably most important in limiting copepod production. Event-scale advection, both zonal and alongshore, can be important in uncoupling primary and secondary production and probably determines the degree to which upwelling-generated pulses of phytoplankton production are utilized by herbivorous plankton in the nearshore zone. ]"

Geological and geomorphological landscape studies are critical to archaeology. Coastal regions provide a wide range of resources to the populations that inhabit them. Coastal landscapes are increasingly the focus of scholarly discussions from the earliest exploitation of littoral resources and early hominin cognition, to the inundation of the earliest permanently settled fishing villages and eventually, formative centres of urbanisation. In the Mediterranean, these would become hubs of maritime transportation that gave rise to the roots of modern seaborne trade. As such, this article represents an original review of both the geo-scientific and archaeological data that specifically relate to sea-level changes and resulting impacts on both physical and cultural landscapes from the Palaeolithic until the emergence of the Classical periods. Our review highlights that the interdisciplinary links between coastal archaeology, geomorphology and sea-level changes are important to explain environmental impacts on coastal human societies and human migration. We review geological indicators of sea level and outline how archaeological features are commonly used as proxies for measuring past sea levels, both gradual changes and catastrophic events. We argue that coastal archaeologists should, as a part of their analyses, incorporate important sea-level concepts, such as indicative meaning. The interpretation of the indicative meaning of Roman fishtanks, for example, plays a critical role in reconstructions of late Holocene Mediterranean sea levels. We identify avenues for future work, which include the consideration of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) in addition to coastal tectonics to explain vertical movements of coastlines, more research on Palaeolithic island colonisation , broadening of Palaeolithic studies to include materials from the entire coastal landscape and not just coastal resources, a focus on rescue of archaeological sites under threat by coastal change, and expansion of underwater archaeological explorations in combination with submarine geomorphology. This article presents a collaborative synthesis of data, some of which have been collected and analysed by the authors, as the MEDFLOOD (MEDiterranean sea-level change and projection for future FLOODing) community, and highlights key sites, data, concepts and ongoing debates. ]"

The western coast was eroded and the eastern part was accreted during 1974 to 2018. Channel and coastal geomorphology have undergone evident adjustments. Human activities have had substantial adverse impacts on the geomorphology. The delta is in sedimentary equilibrium state that may be disturbed in near future. , Intensive studies have been conducted globally in the past decades to understand the evolution of several large deltas. However, despite being one of the largest tropical deltas, the Irrawaddy (Ayeyarwady) Delta has received relatively little attention from the research community. To reduce this knowledge gap, this study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the delta's evolution and identify its influencing factors using remote sensing images from 1974 to 2018, published literature and available datasets on the river, and human impacts in its drainage basin. Our results show that 1) Based on the topographic and geomorphological features , the funnel-shaped Irrawaddy Delta can be divided into two parts: the upper fluvial plain and the lower low-lying coastal plain; 2) The past 44-year shoreline changes show that overall accretion of the delta shoreline was at a rate of 10.4 m/year, and approximately 42% of the shoreline was subjected to erosion from 1974 to 2018. In the western coast, 60% of shoreline was under erosion with an average shoreline change rate of 0.1 m/year. In the east part, 81% of the shoreline was accreted with an average accretion rate of 24 m/year; 3) River channel geomorphological analysis indicates that three distributaries of the Irrawaddy, Bogale, and Toe have developed most active sandbars, which coincides with the amount of water they discharged (&gt;50%). This implies that these three distributaries might be the currently most active channels in the delta; 4) The Irrawaddy mainstream in the Central Dry Zone (the original high sediment yield area) has become less braided and some tributaries have become increasingly straightened, which are highly likely related to reductions in sediment supply and peak flow induced by dam construction ; 5) The large geomorphological adjustments at the two bifurcation points means that the diversions and fractions of water and sediment into the distributaries have likely already changed due to anthropogenic impacts. Our comprehensive analysis suggests that increasing human activities have caused reductions in coarse sediment supply entering the coastal delta plain, further inducing the erosion of the major channels in the lowermost delta and the western delta coast, and the adjustments of fluvial and coastal geomorphology; meanwhile, deforestation and terrestrial mining have provided extra fine sediment, which is mainly transported by the monsoon-driven current to the eastern coast to in part maintain its rapid accretion. Given the situation of rapidly increasing population and climate change, the current natural equilibrium state of the delta setting will most likely be disturbed in the near future. Therefore, our work calls for more intensive monitoring- and modeling-based study in order to better understand the controlling factors influencing the delta evolution in the future. ]"

Threshold metrics can enhance coastal management and decision making, even under uncertainty with future climate change. , The impacts from climate change are increasing the possibility of vulnerable coastal species and habitats crossing critical thresholds that could spur rapid and possibly irreversible changes. For species of high conservation concern, improved knowledge of quantitative thresholds could greatly improve management. To meet this need, we synthesized information pertaining to biological responses as tipping points to sea level rise (SLR) and coastal storms for 45 fish, wildlife, and plant species along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and Caribbean through a literature review and expert elicitation. Although these species were selected based on their ecological, economic, and cultural importance, just over half (56%, n = 25) have quantitative threshold data currently available that can be used to assess the effects of SLR and storms during some aspect of their life history. Birds, reptiles, and plants represent the best studied coastal species. Thirteen of the species (29%) are projected to lose at least 50% of their population or habitat (e.g., foraging, nesting, spawning, or resting habitat) in some areas with a 0.5 m or greater rise in sea levels by 2100. Two species (a bird and reptile) may gain habitat from projected SLR and be resilient to future impacts. Numeric thresholds were not available for the remaining 20 species we searched for. Coastal fishes, mammals, and amphibians were among the groups representing a major information gap in this field of research. In addition, quantitative threshold responses to coastal storms were scarce for all taxa. While vulnerability assessments and qualitative research related to the impacts of SLR and storms on coastal species and habitats are increasing, work that incorporates quantitative thresholds as response and impact metrics remains limited. Additional monitoring, modeling, and research that provides multiple quantitative thresholds across species' life stages and/or latitudinal gradients is ideal to support robust coastal management and decision-making across spatio-temporal scales in the face of climate change. ]"

Topography and climate play a significant role in diverse variations of As levels. The correlation between As and surface environment should be further determined. , Geogenic arsenic (As) in groundwater has a negative impact on public health. Recent studies have introduced the mechanisms of temporal variation in arsenic concentrations in groundwater. Short-term drastic variations in groundwater arsenic are usually associated with anthropogenic activities, such as contamination and groundwater extraction. Periodic variations in groundwater arsenic are mainly caused by seasonal precipitation/evaporation changes, periodic irrigation/pumping and periodic anthropogenic input. Hydrogeochemical processes of these temporal variations in groundwater arsenic involve the dilution/concentration of As, oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite, competitive adsorption between As and other ions including HCO 3 − and PO 4 3− , reductive dissolution of As–Fe/Mn (oxyhydr)oxide, oxidative elimination of aqueous As(III), advection between the aquifers, and the release of As from clay layers. Compared with natural factors, the temporal changes in groundwater As are more susceptible to anthropogenic behaviors; however, topography and climate still play a significant role in diverse patterns of groundwater arsenic concentrations variations. In this study, decreasing groundwater arsenic concentrations in the rainy season and increasing groundwater arsenic concentrations in the dry season were more likely to occur in oxidative aquifers in mountainous areas with fractured bedrock; in coastal areas; or in arid/semiarid inland basins with less anthropogenic interference, such as mines, ponds, farmland, etc. An inverse trend was more likely to occur in reductive aquifers in humid plain/delta areas containing paddy fields and ponds at the surface. More investigations must be conducted to determine the heterogeneity of groundwater arsenic variations at different scales and correlations with the surface environment, including crop cultivation, climate change, land use, and other factors, by using long-term monitoring data. ]"

Taiwan Warm Current has inshore and offshore branches over the East China Sea shelf. Coastally trapped waves greatly regulate the Yellow Sea Warm Current. , In recent years, advances have been made toward understanding the oceanic circulation dynamics in the Taiwan and Tsushima straits, as well as over the central shelf of East China Sea (ECS) and southern Yellow Sea. ECS shelf circulation between the 50 m and 100 m isobaths is attributed to the confluences of the northeastward Taiwan Strait Current (TSC) and Kuroshio intrusion over the shelf to the northeast of Taiwan. Although the relative importance and interaction of these two currents have not been well documented, the driving mechanisms underlying the northeastward TSC have been extensively studied in recent decades. The first set of long-term (2009–2011) observations showed that a stronger/weaker TSC (~2.37 Sv/~0.64 Sv) appears in summer/winter. However, the dynamics underlying the northeastward TSC against the northeasterly winds in winter are still debatable. The destination of the ECS shelf current in the formation of the Tsushima Warm Current is better understood. The volume transport of this current is ~2.67 Sv. The northeastward-flowing Taiwan Warm Current has two branches over the 50 m and 100 m isobaths. The northwestward Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) characterizes the shelf circulations in the Yellow Sea Trough in winter, and the propagation of coastally trapped waves greatly regulates the flow pattern of the YSWC. The Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass alters the shelf circulations in the southern Yellow Sea in summer. ]"

Nitrogen removal is dominated by Anammox rather than denitrification during La Niña. Primary production is nutrient and temperature-limited during El Niño and La Niña respectively. Mesoscale eddy activity induces the removal of coastal nutrients offshore. Coastal upwelling centers are enhanced sources of nitrous oxide gas during La Niña. , The response of the ocean biogeochemistry to intense El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the Northern Humboldt Current System (NHCS) is assessed with an eddy-resolving coupled physical-biogeochemical model. El Niño (EN) 1997–1998 and La Niña (LN) 1999–2000 are well reproduced, inducing large spatial and temporal variability of biogeochemical properties at three coastal upwelling centers along the Peruvian coast (Chimbote 9.4°S, Callao 12.1°S, and Pisco 14°S). During EN, the upper limit of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) experiences an offshore displacement of, approximately, 60 km and a deepening of, approximately, 150 m when compared to neutral-ENSO conditions, thus ventilating the upper 100 m of the water column. In contrast, during LN, the OMZ tongue outcrops over the continental shelf deoxygenating the water column at all locations. During LN, at the southernmost location, enhanced Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) induces a leaking of the coastal nutrient inventory by horizontally advecting nitrogen from the nearshore region into the oligotrophic ocean. This leads to a reduction of biological production in the coastal zone. During EN, nitrification is an order of magnitude larger than denitrification in supplying the nitrite coastal pool. During LN peak, nitrification is reduced by 80%, while denitrification becomes equally important, evidencing a coupling between these two oxygen-dependent processes. The nitrogen removal due to suboxic activity is mostly controlled by the Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation (Anammox) in the southern domain during neutral-ENSO conditions. Our results show that during EN, denitrification contributes with 60% of the total nitrogen removal. In contrast, Anammox contributes with 70% during LN. The outgassing of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), an intermediate product of denitrification, is reduced and enhanced during EN and LN, respectively, and it is strongly modulated by the spatiotemporal variability of oxygen in the environment. ]"

Preliminary analysis of the reasons for the large scale of green tides in 2021 Providing suggestions for further research on green tide prevention , As global ecological disasters, green tide outbreaks have been observed in the Southern Yellow Sea (SYS) of China since 2007, resulting in considerable economic losses and environmental damage to the coastal cities of Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces. Therefore, prevention of green tides is crucial. Previous studies have revealed that a relatively small green tide outbreak scale in the SYS was observed in 2018 and 2020, with the green tides covering areas of 193 km 2 and 192 km 2 and durations of 91 days and 64 days, respectively. Killing green macroalgae attached to cultivation ropes in Neopyropia aquaculture areas, which has been considered a primary source of the blooms, early removal of Neopyropia aquaculture rafts, and green tide prevention in the SYS are the key reasons for the decrease in green tides in 2018 and 2020. Furthermore, to address the challenges associated with the current green tide source prevention measures, we proposed a comprehensive control method that combines ecological farming, early green tide prevention, and resource utilization. Potential secondary pollution caused by the chemicals used to control Ulva prolifera can be minimized. Conversely, Neopyropia yezoensis quality may be enhanced through continuous improvement of its culturing process, which in turn, could reduce the green tide blooming scale. ]"

On March 31, 2017, China issued the first regulation on the management of coastline protection and utilization. The focus of the regulation is the retention rate control system of natural coastline. The regulation requires ecological construction be conducted on the newly-formed coastline. An institutional system of the protection and utilization of China's coastline is established. , The coastline serves as a space carrier of marine economic development in coastal areas, and is an important platform for protecting marine environments and maintaining ecological balance. The integral components of a natural coastline have important ecological functions. In addition to the excessive economic development in China's coastal areas since the 1990s, other problems have occurred such as: a sharp decrease in natural coast due to the artificialization of mainland coastline, inefficient utilization of coastline resources by unplanned projects, weak legal enforcement by an imperfect management system, and impaired coastal functional value. By analyzing problems arising from the protection and utilization of China's coastline in the past 30 years, this paper reviews the relevant policies and regulations in China's marine administration. These issues are approached from the perspectives of an ecosystem, refined management of marine resources, scientific planning and natural coastline protection. The results indicate an improvement in the ecological environment through the introduction of multiple management systems. For instance, the natural coastline of China is currently decreasing at a rate slower than in 2008, and has a stable retention rate. Additionally, the over-exploitation of coastline has been curbed with a scientific and rational allocation of coastline resources; ecological problems such as coastal erosion , beach and coastal wetland degradation have been improved. The introduction of relevant policies, including, “Regulations on the Management of Coastline Protection and Utilization” fundamentally changed the passive decentralized management model. An initial institutional system that is in line with the protection and utilization status of China's coastline has been formed. Simultaneously, all levels of China's marine management departments are exploring and improving the coastline management system. Ultimately, this will provide valuable experience and practice in the protection and utilization of coastline for coastal countries across the world. ]"

Anthropogenic activities and particle size of sediments are the main factors affecting HMs distribution. HM pollution in some bays of Fujian province is worse than in other regions. Inter-annual changes of HMs in some bays have not been obvious in recent years. Molluscs have high levels of HMs. , Due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, heavy metal (HM) pollution in coastal areas of the East China Sea (ECS) has attracted extensive attention. This article attempts to review recent studies on the temporal and spatial distributions, ecological risks, and possible sources of HMs in typical bays and estuaries of ECS. The levels of HMs are closely related to local economic development and local characteristics. The anthropogenic activities and the particle size of sediments are important factors affecting the distribution of HMs. During the late 1970s to the 1990s, HMs levels in the Yangtze Estuary (YRE) sediments showed an upward tendency due to the increased emissions. However, HMs levels in the early 2000s were lower than that in the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. Cd caused serious pollution and brought potential ecological risks in the Yangtze Estuary, Hangzhou Bay (HZB), Sanmen Bay (SMB), and Quanzhou Bay (QZB). In Fujian province of China, the Quanzhou Bay was heavily polluted by HMs and high contents of HMs were found in biota.

Uploading the high-quality images of the manuscript figures. , Ocean Water Quality (OWQ) monitoring provides insights into the quality of water in marine and near-shore environments. OWQ measurements can contain the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of oceanic waters, where low OWQ values indicate an unhealthy ecosystem. Many parameters of water can be estimated from Remote Sensing (RS) data. Thus, RS offers significant opportunities for monitoring water quality in estuaries , coastal waterways, and the ocean. This paper reviews various RS systems and techniques for OWQ monitoring. It first introduces the common OWQ parameters, followed by the definition of the parameters and techniques of OWQ monitoring with RS techniques. In this study, the following OWQ parameters were reviewed: chlorophyll-a, colored dissolved organic matter, turbidity or total suspended matter/solid, dissolved organic carbon , Secchi disk depth, suspended sediment concentration, and sea surface temperature . This study presents a systematic analysis of the capabilities and types of spaceborne systems (e.g., optical and thermal sensors, passive microwave radiometers , active microwave scatterometers , and altimeters) which are commonly applied to OWQ assessment . The paper also provides a summary of the opportunities and limitations of RS data for spatial and temporal estimation of OWQ. Overall, it was observed that chlorophyll-a and colored dissolved organic matter are the dominant parameters applied to OWQ monitoring. It was also concluded that the data from optical and passive microwave sensors could effectively be applied to estimate OWQ parameters. From a methodological perspective, semi-empirical algorithms generally outperform the other empirical, analytical, and semi-analytical methods for OWQ monitoring. ]"

In this review, we propose a new and complementary hypothesis describing the biophysical processes intervening in the recruitment of temperate fish larvae into estuaries . This new hypothesis, the Sense Acuity And Behavioral (SAAB) hypothesis, recognizes that recruitment is unlikely if the larvae drift passively with the water currents , and that successful recruitment requires the sense acuity of temperate fish larvae and their behavioral response to the estuarine cues present in coastal areas. We propose that temperate fish larvae use a hierarchy of sensory cues (odor, sound, visual and geomagnetic cues) to detect estuarine nursery areas and to aid during navigation towards these areas. The sensorial acuity increases along ontogeny , which coincides with increased swimming capabilities. The swimming strategies of post-flexion larvae differ from offshore areas to the tidal zone. In offshore areas, innate behavior might lead larvae towards the coast guided by a sun compass or by the earth's geomagnetic field . In areas under limited influence of estuarine plumes (either in energetic nearshore areas or offshore), post-flexion larvae display a searching swimming behavior for estuarine disconnected patches (infotaxis strategy). After finding an estuarine plume, larvae may swim along the increasing cue concentration to ingress into the estuary. Here, larvae exhibit a rheotaxis behavior and avoid displacement by longshore currents by keeping bearing during navigation. When larvae reach the vicinity of an estuary, merging diel rhythms with feeding and predator avoidance strategies with tidally induced movements is essential to increase their chances of estuarine ingress. A fish larva recruitment model developed for the Ria Formosa lagoon supports the general framework of the SAAB hypothesis. In this model, the ingress of virtual Sparidae temperate larvae into this nursery area increases from 1.5% to 32.1% when directional swimming guided by estuarine cues is included as a forcing parameter. ]"

No consensus has been reached on the definition of the HWM worldwide. The position of the HWM is influenced by a number of factors. Advantages and disadvantages exist in different HWM definitions. The corresponding capture methods vary among different HWM definitions. , The High Water Mark (HWM) is an important cadastral boundary that separates land and water. It is also used as a baseline to facilitate coastal hazard management from which land and infrastructure development is offset to ensure the protection of property from storm surge and sea level rise . The determination of the HWM has a long history. Its definition, the mean and even the corresponding determination methods have changed through time. In addition, the location of the HWM is difficult to define accurately due to the ambulatory nature of water and coastal morphology variations. To better understand the HWM determination, this paper reviews the development of the definition of HWM, including ordinary high water mark (OHWM), mean high water mark (MHWM), mean high water spring (MHWS) and mean higher high water (MHHW), and the existing HWM indicators, such as vegetation line and beach morphological features. Two common methods of HWM determination, field survey and remote sensing , are discussed in this paper. This is followed by the investigation of the possible factors that influence the variation of the HWM position. Furthermore, an overview of the ambulatory nature of both water and coastal morphology, which contributes to the difficulties in HWM determination, is provided. Finally, the limitations of previous determination methods and future direction in HWM determination studies are also discussed. This study concludes that it is necessary to develop a robust analytical system to identify, evaluate and integrate various factors into the process of determining the HWM. ]"

Coastal environments are differentiated from freshwater settings due to water salinity and the effects of tides and waves that have important implications for the measurement approach and generated results. The framework in which seepage meters have been used in marine settings has evolved in parallel to the understanding of submarine groundwater discharge. This review of seepage meter research shows: an uneven distribution of studies in the world with some densely-studied regions and an absolute lack of data in other regions; a dominance of studies where only seepage meters were used compared to studies that combined seepage meter measurements with values determined with radioactive tracers or hydraulic calculations; and a variety of publication outlets with different focuses (hydrology, oceanography or multidisciplinary). The historical overview of the research conducted with seepage meters shows the wide range of seepage meter applications – from simply measuring fluxes at local scales to larger studies that extrapolate local results to estimate fluxes of water, nutrients, and other solutes at regional and global scales. A variety of automated seepage meters have been developed and used to better characterize short-term groundwater-seawater exchange, including the effects of waves and tides. We present recommendations and considerations to guide seepage meter deployment in marine settings, as seepage meters are still the only method that quantifies directly the interaction between groundwater and surface water. ]"

In doing so, this study reviews historical practices of disaster management in rivers and coasts as well as reconstruction process after the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE). It reveals how ecosystem approaches are integrated in river and coast works and highlights some of the relevant policies, technical guidance and guidelines and good practices on the ground. This study also documents how Eco-DRR policy evolved and implemented after the GEJE and addresses some of the challenges in its implementation. In order to draw additional insights, the reconstruction processes of Hurricane Sandy in the United States (US) was also reviewed as GEJE and Sandy shares some common features. Experience from Sandy suggests the importance of the participatory planning process rather than technical guidance or guidelines. Although it is too early to judge whether either reconstruction process was better or not, nor difficult to generalize the conclusion from only two samples, these two experiences suggest only technical guidance and guidelines is not sufficient to mainstream Eco-DRR/CCA in the reconstruction from large scale, rare and infrequent disasters. It is also suggested that the critical role of participatory planning process with cross-sector, cross-professional and interactive design approach may lead more innovative solutions. ]"

PCBs and PAHs concentration are continuously increasing. These POPs are highly toxic to the aquatic environment. Stern regulations and control are vital to curbing the POPs problem. Effluent treatment can control the POPs concentration within limits. , Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are increasing in waterways due to human activities and their concentration above a certain level is highly toxic with acute damage. In this manuscript, we have compiled the data of these POPs in Chinese freshwater channels, lakes, and corresponding coastal areas from the studies performed in the last twelve years. All the water channels were contaminated with Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), Organo-chlorine pesticides (OCPs), and Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Although most of these water channels maintain the GB5749–2006 guideline for POPs, Liaohe River, Huaihe River, Yangpu Bay, Taihu Lake, Liuzhou surface water, Pearl River Estuary, and Jinzhou Bay have toxicity levels and the maximum concentration of these POPs is above the defined safe limits. Pharmacokinetic data for thirty-eight POPs by SwissADME showed that they were highly penetrable through the skin (Log Kp -6.02 to 0.15) and orally absorbable (bioavailability score 0.55). Therefore, these waterways have acute damaging potential. This indicates that using these water channels for municipal supplies might lead to massive health hazards. Therefore, careful mapping and treatment are necessary before the utilization of water from these water reservoirs. ]"

Through the application of this concept, many Earth scientists have assessed the roles of focal species in modulating landscape formation and dynamics. No species, however, lives or evolves in isolation; moreover, few species exist without any engineering effects on their ambient environment. Based on these basic premises, it appears unlikely that any landform on Earth (except, for example, hyperarid desert dunes , recent lava flows , and glacial grooves) exclusively represents the engineering impact of a single species. Thus, surface topography, to some degree, can generally be a combined expression of ≥ two species that mutually interact with each other through their own engineering activities. The purpose of the present research was to review, refine, and expand upon the original ecosystem engineering concept to make it more inclusive and comprehensive. Accordingly, a new concept has been proposed here, the windows of combined ecosystem engineering (WoCEE), to indicate the range within which the relative importance of engineering effects for ≥ two species changes along a gradient, as defined by various abiotic and biotic factors. In support of this novel idea, real-world examples are presented, including ecological succession in terrestrial and coastal dune ecosystems, crab–plant interactions on tidal wetlands, pocket gopher–plant relationships in the grasslands, and biological invasions by exotic mollusks and macrophytes . Notably, there are likely various other examples in nature, provided the spatiotemporal scales at which multiple species play their bioengineering roles correspond to those at which landforms are shaped. This framework represents an important step forward in the realization of true ecosystem engineering and will potentially serve as a unifying theme of biogeomorphology. ]"

Lower shorefaces are diverse, and range from bedrock-controlled, through sediment-starved to sediment-rich, siliciclastic, carbonate, low to high wave-energy, microtidal to macrotidal, and are variably affected by storm and wind-driven flows. The lower shoreface can be a repository for deposits of terrestrial origin , and a zone of active carbonate production. It can therefore be an important source of sediment for beaches, dunes , estuaries , and tidal basins. There has been progress in the ability to predict suspended sediment transport under non-breaking and shoaling waves across the lower shoreface. However, high-resolution measurement of sediment transport over unknown seabed configurations with unpredictable bed-level changes under hydrodynamic conditions that are unknown at the outset, and especially involving bedload transport, is still faced with significant challenges. Non-linear interactions between processes contributing to sediment transport render calculations and modelling of transport directions and magnitudes uncertain, and the spatial and temporal scales of transport are much larger than those of the upper shoreface. On the other hand, transport rates and morphological change may be much smaller on the lower shoreface compared to the upper shoreface. Another challenge is the upscaling of short-term measurements to explain the long-term morphological evolution of the lower shoreface. This limited understanding implies that current paradigms of lower shoreface dynamics based on morphological equilibrium and disequilibrium relative to the ocean-forcing conditions may be too simplistic, though possibly appropriate over long timescales (decades to millennia), and modelling work and prediction of change no more than exploratory. Over such long timescales, boundary conditions (sea level, wave climate) are likely to change. Making way forward on these issues is important for understanding the connectivity between the lower shoreface and beach recovery after major storm erosion, and for estimating coastal sediment budgets , short- to long-term coastal change and response to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. At geological timescales, the lower shoreface is a central element in tracking shoreline changes . Progress is needed in measuring sediment transport and upscaling to timescales compatible with lower shoreface change. It is also important to take advantage of on-going rapid progress in seabed and shallow stratigraphic mapping, bed-level changes, including remote-sensing approaches, for a better understanding of lower shoreface morphodynamics and sediment connectivity with the coast. This includes the now routine identification of large subaqueous bedforms , possibly ubiquitous features on the world's continental shelves, their mobility over time, and their potential link with the shoreline . The common relationship between fine sand, dissipative beaches and large aeolian dunes also poses the question of how fine sand is abundantly supplied from the lower shoreface, given the common perception that it is readily swept offshore on beaches. These multi-theme challenges need to be addressed in order to advance our understanding of the lower shoreface and its connectivity with the upper shoreface and beach. ]"

Fish, bird, and invertebrates mostly recover within five years. Systems can still exhibit variation from reference habitats up to 130 years post breach. Breaching of embankments often restores conditions that are more natural and increases estuary similarity to reference systems. , Breaching of coastal causeways and dikes (embankments) is a common method used to restore estuaries and marshes to a more natural state. Here, we reviewed literature pertaining to embankment breaches to assess the effectiveness of this restoration method and to provide practical advice for future breaches. While all methods of embankment breaching can be successful, active measures appear to be more successful than allowing breaches to occur naturally. Restoring tidal flow sooner, and to a greater degree, will speed recovery of impacted systems. Overall, recovery is often quick, with hydrology changing immediately. Sedimentation and erosion patterns also change soon after breaching, but it can take up to 15 years for sediment elevation to stabilize, and 60–100 years for equilibrium conditions to develop. Marsh plant communities recover rapidly, with most systems almost fully recovering within 5–20 years. Fish, bird, and invertebrate communities also mostly recover within five years. Unfortunately, recovery is often not complete. Even with large investments of time and money, systems can still exhibit variation from reference habitats in their biotic and abiotic conditions up to 130 years post breach. In some cases, this may be due to embankment remnants still impacting the system. Conversely, the systems may have changed too much, and/or global climate change may have altered successional pathways to such a degree that recovery to pre-disturbance conditions is unlikely. Regardless, breaching of coastal embankments often restores conditions that are more natural and increases estuary similarity to reference systems. As such, breaching is a useful prescription for coastal restoration, one that can deliver a considerable return on investment . ]"

It was observed that H. beccarii has a pan India distribution on both the east and the west coast of India. It is abundant in the intertidal silty-muddy region on the west coast and sandy and muddy habitats on the east coast. H. beccarii was found to be associated with mangroves or smaller seagrass species within a depth limit of 1.7m. Low salinity and high nitrate levels were observed at the H. beccarii meadows of the west coast due to their association with mangroves. The nutrient levels in H. beccarii meadows were comparatively lower than in the other seagrass meadows of India. Most of the research on H. beccarii has focussed on its morphometrics (22%), reproductive (22%), and bioactive compounds (18%) ecology along the coast of India. Reproductive traits such as flowering and fruiting vary according to the seasons of each coast due to the influence of monsoon and its associated changes in temperature, salinity, and nutrient influx. H. beccarii is a source of various bioactive compounds, which needs further investigation. Habitat disturbance, anthropogenic pollution, and coastal development are the three major causes for the decline of H. beccarii ecosystems in India. A significant loss of the seagrass was observed from the west coast of India due to increased coastal development activities. There is an acute need to quantify H. beccarii population trends, the impact of climate and anthropogenic stressors, economic values of ecosystem services, and the role of ecological connectivity for the better conservation and management of H. beccarii seascapes across India. There is a need for increased research and monitoring of seagrass meadows and the integration of research outcomes while framing policies in order to prevent further loss of this vulnerable seagrass. ]"

Negril's hotels need to exercise corporate environmental responsibility to ensure sustainable tourism. Capacity building and community participation are measures of success for protected area management and sustainable tourism. , In Negril, beach erosion is a major environmental concern, caused by similar anthropogenic stressors impacting populated coastal areas worldwide. This review recapitulates the environmental circumstances leading to beach erosion in Negril through the lens of global and regional trends, arguing in favor of the ecosystem approach for long term mitigation. Evidence points to depleted coastal ecosystems and services, calling for the restoration of the neglected Negril Environmental Protected Area (NEPA) which contains the entire tidal flow of the beach barrier system.

Assessing the degree of vulnerability and the nature and extent of probable impacts of climate change on coastal wetlands is necessary to develop adaptation strategies. Here we review and synthesize existing scientific information to examine climate change impacts on physical and biotic processes of hypersaline salt marshes in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico. In this region, negative estuaries provide nursery and refuge for migratory species and sustain important fisheries. We found marshes in the Northern Gulf may be susceptible to the effects increased CO 2 , sea-level rise, storm frequency and intensity, changes in ambient temperature, and ocean physical changes, including elevated sea temperature, and acidification . The responses of coastal marshes to these climate change effects will likely be interactive and hard to predict; climatic interannual variability (i.e. El Niño-Southern Oscillation) will play an important role in determining the strength and directionality of the impacts. Given the uncertainty of climate change effects, it will be important to continue ongoing monitoring programs and implement new ones that help separate natural variability from the effects of climate change. Management actions and adaptation plans will be needed that consider uncertainty, are flexible, and encourage ongoing learning.

The subduction is followed by the oblique collision between the Luzon arc and the subducting Eurasian plate from 6.5 Ma. The North Luzon Trough forearc strata and the Luzon arc are then obducted northwestward as the Coastal Range, eastern Taiwan, in the last 1 Ma. The collision propagates southward and is presently active in the region offshore SE Taiwan. Integrating seismic surveys offshore and a detailed forearc stratigraphy study onshore the Coastal Range, this paper overviews the characteristics of forearc deformation, dynamic sequence stratigraphy , temporal-spatial variations of forearc sedimentation and stratigraphic correlation onshore and offshore forearc sequences in response to the oblique convergent tectonics north of 20°N. Combining onshore and offshore forearc geology together allows us to reconstruct a structural evolution of the North Luzon Trough forearc basin from subduction through collision to obduction , and to discuss the mechanism and processes responsible for developments of the modern-forming forearc Lichi Mélange during the active Taiwan orogeny . Seismic surveys offshore show that forearc deformation in the subduction zone is primarily caused by increase of rear prism slope and west-vergent thrusting of forearc strata along the prism top since the early forearc sedimentation. East-vergent backthrusting occurs during the late forearc sedimentation and propagates arcward when the volcanic arc collides with the accretionary prism in the collision zone . Bivergent thrusting leads to a development of the forearc Huatung Ridge popup as a bathymetric high which further controls the sedimentation of the younger forearc sequence in the collision zone . In response to the syn -sedimentation deformation, forearc depocenter shifts progressively eastward. Forearc stratigraphy thus changes from two mega-sequences bounded by an unconformity in the subduction zone to three mega-sequences juxtaposed from west to east unconformably in the collision zone. As a consequence, the forearc deformation and stratigraphy in the oblique collision zone off SE Taiwan show a characteristic temporal-spatial pattern that the lowest mega-sequence with the most intensive deformation occurs restrictedly in the west, whiles the middle and the upper mega-sequences with mild deformation crop out in the center and the eastern part of the forearc basin , respectively. Detailed biostratigraphy study using planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannoplanktons indicates that the forearc strata onshore the Coastal Range are also composed of three sequences (lower unit S-1: 6.5–5.8 Ma; middle unit S-2: 5.8–3.0 Ma; and upper unit S-3: &lt;3.0–1 Ma). They were previously mapped as lithostratigraphy units of the Lichi Mélange (6.5–3.0 Ma) in the west and the coherent flysch sequences of the Fanshuliao Formation (5.8–3.0 Ma) and the Paliwan Formation (&lt;3.0–1 Ma) in the east. However, the young coherent forearc sequences in the east thrust westward ubiquitously over the old and highly deformed Lichi Mélange in the west along the listric east-dipping Tuluanshan fault during the obduction . Detailed biostratigraphy study reveals that the lower sequence unit S-1 exposes restrictedly in the Lichi Mélange west of the Tuluanshan fault, whereas the middle sequence unit S-2 are either mapped as part of the Lichi Mélange or the coherent Fanshuliao Formation in both sides of the Tuluanshan fault, respectively. The upper sequence unit S-3 exposes exclusively east of middle sequence unit S-2 in the eastern Coastal Range. Stratigraphy and sedimentology study also reveals a temporal-spatial sedimentation variation of the upper sequence unit S-3 owing to deformation of the sequence units S-1 and S-2 together as a Pliocene Forearc Ridge at ~3 Ma, a scenario analog to development of the modern Huatung Ridge at ~1 Ma in active collision zone offshore. Temporal-spatial pattern of forearc sequences onshore the Coastal Range suggests that these three sequence units are juxtaposed from west to east and are bounded by two unconformities analog to what occur today in the collision zone offshore SE Taiwan. The characteristic deformation and an eastward-youngling trend of strata distribution onshore the Coastal Range all indicate Syn-sedimentation deformation during the oblique collision in 6.5–1 Ma. Furthermore, along the N-S orogenic strike, events of the forearc sedimentation and bivergent thrusting occur earlier onshore the obduction zone in the north than the modern collision zone offshore in the south. Across the orogenic strike forearc strata get older and deformation gets intensive from east to west onshore the Coastal Range, a scenario analog to what observed in the oblique convergent region offshore SE Taiwan. A structure reconstruction reveals that the North Luzon Trough forearc strata have experienced multiple stages of thrust deformation from subduction through collision to obduction. These deformations account for the mechanism and processes to develop the modern-forming highly sheared SSZ-bearing forearc Lichi Mélange tectonically in the western Coastal Range during the last 1 Ma. ]"

The Caribbean coast is constantly subject to trade winds and episodically to hurricanes and tsunami-triggered waves. The Atlantic coasts of Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina suffer the action of storm surges coming from the south (southeasterlies). At the same time, the South American coast is particularly exposed to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-triggered effects. These effects are different in different regions. In Colombia the seasonal increase of the mean sea level alters the dynamics of barrier islands. In Peru, ENSOs are responsible for sudden inputs of sediments to the coast; similar processes impact the estuarine complexes of Lagoa dos Patos (southern Brazil) or Paraná-Rio de la Plata floods (Argentina–Uruguay). In northern Brazil, on the other hand, dry conditions induce the migration of dunes landward. In several countries of South America, population is concentrated at or near the coast, and therefore some natural coastal processes increase their impacts.

It has been used to create new habitat either as a broad-scale biodiversity gain, or as a measure specifically to offset losses to commercial developments. This has focussed attention on only one part of the role realignment plays in coastal management rather than its broader significance in restoring accommodation space and the policy significance of this attribute. This paper draws attention to the relationship between coastal erosion and the role accommodation space plays in husbandry of sediment supplies. Inadequate accommodation space leads to loss of sediment that cannot be readily replaced. Loss of sediment has long-term implications for coastal evolution and the degree to which coastal evolution maintains an economically sustainable coastal environment. This paper argues that attention must shift away from nature conservation outcomes as the primary policy driver for managed realignment in the UK and in Europe. Instead, there are sound engineering and social reasons for greater emphasis on realignment but to make this happen there has to be a reduction in the emphasis on wildlife and a much greater focus on engineering and water management. Relatively small policy adjustments are needed but a much more profound change in presentation is needed so that decision-makers and stakeholders pay more attention to the engineering need for realignment. ]"

Historically, such artificial reefs formed an important component of the socio-economic development of coastal fisheries. In comparison, modern artificial reefs have taken on a variety of forms. The most widely recognized are purpose-build modular artificial reefs designed for the enhancement of fisheries yield, diving, and various other benefits. However, far more common within the Gulf are the large-scale unplanned artificial reefs that have been formed as a result of human activities in the marine system, such as large-scale coastal breakwaters, seawalls, jetties, pipelines, and oil and gas infrastructure. Although there is limited information on the role of these constructions in structuring Gulf marine communities, increasing evidence suggests that abundant and diverse communities of reef fish, coral and other benthos can develop on these structures, with important ecological implications in urbanized coastal areas in the Gulf. However, due to a variety of unintended consequences of artificial reef development such structures may also pose challenges to coastal marine management. We review the current published literature on artificial reefs in the Gulf in order to improve our understanding of the role that these structures play in Gulf coastal ecosystems, and to further develop regional management of artificial reefs. We explore the various types of artificial reef that exist in the Gulf and examine the benefits and challenges that these structures represent for coastal ecology and economics.

A fundamental problem in shore process studies is that of integrating scale differences, notably within the perspective of large-scale coastal behavior. Furthermore, processes operating on the shore are characterized by temporal continuity, but with variations in intensity and frequency that may be periodic, as for tides; completely aperiodic, as in the case of storms and tsunamis; or possibly involving some form of cyclic behavior, as for El Nino/La Nina-type events.

This systematic review and evidence synthesis examined deliberate, researcher-initiated, efforts to integrate local and scientific knowledge within the context of DRR and EWS, exploring the motivations for knowledge integration, the processes of knowledge integration and the outcomes of these processes. Twenty empirical studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. The results indicate that the motivations for knowledge integration derived from real life challenges, that is, that top down DRR measures had not been adopted by local communities and that the knowledge of local or scientific communities in isolation was unable to manage disaster risk. Furthermore, knowledge integration was seen to empower communities and produce DRR interventions that were responsive to local needs and sensitivities. The processes of knowledge integration were participatory and interactive, and a range of outcomes were generated within the context of participatory projects. Nevertheless, neither the processes nor the outcomes of knowledge integration had been formally evaluated. Participatory processes of knowledge integration and evaluation of processes and outcomes need to be considered carefully during the design of the research, allowing for necessary time and the inclusion of appropriate expertise. ]"

Consequently, the knowledge on marine flooding has progressed significantly for the last years and this review, focused on storm-induced marine submersions, responds to the need for a synthesis. Three main components are presented in the review: (1) a state-of-the-art on marine submersions from the viewpoint of several scientific disciplines; (2) a selection of examples demonstrating the added value of interdisciplinary approaches to improve our knowledge of marine submersions; (3) a selection of examples showing how the management of future crises or the planning efforts to adapt to marine submersions can be supported by new results or techniques from the research community. From a disciplinary perspective, recent progress was achieved with respect to physical processes, numerical modeling, the knowledge of past marine floods and vulnerability assessment. At a global scale, the most vulnerable coastal areas to marine flooding with high population density are deltas and estuaries . Recent and well-documented floods allow analyzing the vulnerability parameters of different coastal zones. While storm surges can nowadays be reproduced accurately, the modeling of coastal flooding is more challenging, particularly when barrier breaches and wave overtopping have to be accounted for. The chronology of past marine floods can be reconstructed combining historical archives and sediment records. Sediment records of past marine floods localized in back barrier depressions are more adequate to reconstruct past flooding chronology. For the two last centuries, quantitative and descriptive historical data can be used to characterize past marine floods. Beyond providing a chronology of events, sediment records combined with geochronology , statistical analysis and climatology , can be used to reconstruct millennial-scale climate variability and enable a better understanding of the possible regional and local long-term trends in storm activity. Sediment records can also reveal forgotten flooding of exceptional intensity, much more intense than those of the last few decades. Sedimentological and historical archives, combined with high-resolution topographic data or numerical hindcast of storms can provide quantitative information and explanations for marine flooding processes. From these approaches, extreme past sea levels height can be determined and are very useful to complete time series provided by the instrumental measurements on shorter time scales. In particular, historical data can improve the determination of the return periods associated with extreme water levels, which are often inaccurate when computed based on instrumental data, due to the presence of gaps and too short time-series. Long-term numerical hindcast of tides and surges can also be used to provide the required time series for statistical analysis. Worst-case scenarios, used to define coastal management plans and strategies, can be obtained from realistic atmospheric settings with different tidal ranges and by shifting the trajectory of storms. Management of future crises and planning efforts to adapt to marine submersions are optimized by predictions of water levels from hydrodynamic models. Such predictions combined with in situ measurements and analysis of human stakes can be used to define a vulnerability index. Then, the efficiency of adaptation measures can be evaluated with respect to the number of lives that could be potentially saved. Numerical experiments also showed that the realignment of coastal defenses could result in water level reduction up to 1 m in the case where large marshes are flooded. Such managed realignment of coastal defenses may constitute a promising adaptation to storm-induced flooding and future sea level rise . From a legal perspective, only a few texts pay specific attention to the risk of marine flooding whether nationally or globally. Recent catastrophic events and their unintended consequences in terms of death and damages have triggered political decisions, like in USA after hurricane Katrina, and in France after catastrophic floods that occurred in 2010. ]"

During glacial period deep-cut landscape prevailed in the plain due to sea level lowering and concomitant headward incision. Sea level rise after LGM raised Yangtze water level which filled up the incised valleys and depressions to form lakes. Influence of sea level change on land surface at orbital timescales could be felt &gt;1400 km upstream from the coast. , The Yangtze Plain (floodplains in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River) is a region with numerous lakes, including the three largest freshwater lakes in China, i.e. Poyang Lake (PYL), Dongting Lake (DTL), and Taihu Lake (THL). The formation mechanism of these lakes offers insights into the ongoing debate concerning the interaction between tectonic activity, climate, sea-level, human impact , and Earth-surface processes. Previous studies have usually focused on individual lakes, so there remains no over-arching and consistent framework for lake formation in the region as a whole. Here we review published sedimentary and chronological records on the above three lakes and propose that sea-level change has determined their formation. During the last glacial maximum (LGM; ca 30–20 ka), with a sea-level &gt;120 m lower than present, a landscape of incised valleys and interfluves prevailed over the entire Yangtze Plain, including the DTL area, which is &gt;1400 km upstream from the modern river mouth, and there was no large lake on the plain. The lakes emerged in the Holocene , although more precise ages await further investigations. The glacial sea-level lowstand , with concomitant headward incision, was responsible for the extensive deeply incised landscape of the LGM, whereas the Holocene high sea-level, with resultant infilling of the incised valleys, accounted for the formation of lakes. This sea-level forcing hypothesis suggests a more far-reaching influence of sea-level change on the Yangtze Plain, and a closer relationship between Earth-surface processes and glacial–interglacial cycles (global climate) than is commonly believed. According to our newly hypothesized climate-controlled geomorphological (CCG) model, it is very likely that similar lake-forming processes could have occurred multiple times during earlier glacial–interglacial cycles, and that this pattern might also have occurred in many other river systems in the eastern coastal areas of China, as well as in other similar river plains worldwide, thus having an important role in shaping modern coastal-plain landscapes. Further work is required to test this CCG model. ]"

Baseline data on marine debris pollution is fundamental to coastal ecosystem health. Natural and synthetic polymers dominated the types of marine debris along the Malaysian beaches, at more than 84%. Plastic packaging is the main type of plastic debris accumulated on the beach. Marine debris was also recorded in isolated and non-habitable islands in Malaysia. , The launch of Roadmap towards Zero Single-use Plastics in 2018 demands baseline data on the management of marine debris in Malaysia. In 2021, Malaysia is placed 28th top plastic polluter in the world with plastic consumption at 56 kg/capita/year, therefore data on mismanaged plastic is imperative. This paper reviews the abundance and distribution of marine debris in selected Malaysian beaches over the last decade (2010–2020) and discusses issue on its management. Plastic debris on beaches in Malaysia, was reported to range from 64 items/m 2 , to as high as 1930 items/m 2 , contributing 30–45% of total waste collected. Plastics film was the most dominant, mainly originated from packaging materials. Therefore, appropriate action including improved marine waste management system is crucial to tackle the problem, together with effective governance mechanisms. Various suggestions were proposed based on the statistical-environmental data to reduce the occurrence of marine debris in the country. ]"

Sediment DOM shows more aromatic and more reduced characteristics than overlying DOM. DOC from inland sediment DOM is generally higher than coastal areas. Mixed sources are dominant for inland sediment DOM but not for coastal sediment DOM. , Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sediments, termed here sediment DOM, plays a variety of important roles in global biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients as well as in the fate and transport of xenobiotics . Here we reviewed sediment DOM, including pore waters and water extractable organic matter from inland and coastal sediments , based on recent literature (from 1996 to 2014). Sampling, pre-treatment, and characterization methods for sediment DOM were summarized. The characteristics of sediment DOM have been compared along an inland to coastal ecosystems gradient and also with the overlying DOM in water column to distinguish the unique nature of it. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from inland sediment DOM was generally higher than coastal areas, while no notable differences were found for their aromaticity and apparent molecular weight. Fluorescence index (FI) revealed that mixed sources are dominant for inland sediment DOM, but marine end-member prevails for coastal sediment DOM. Many reports showed that sediments operate as a net source of DOC and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) to the water column. Sediment DOM has shown more enrichment of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds in the elemental signature than the overlying DOM. Fluorescent fingerprint investigated by excitation-emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) further demonstrated the characteristics of sediment DOM lacking in the photo-oxidized and the intermediate components, which are typically present in the overlying surface water. In addition, the biogeochemical changes in sediment DOM and the subsequent environmental implications were discussed with the focus on the binding and the complexation properties with pollutants. ]"

Because restoration efforts can alter shoreline or beach morphology , revisiting source inputs is often necessary. Microbial source tracking (MST) using source-specific molecular markers, genomic community analyses, and physical modeling was used to identify contamination sources along three Lake Michigan beaches of the Laurentian Great Lakes with historically high fecal indicator bacteria (FIB, E. coli ) concentrations. Genetic markers for human (Bacteroides HF183) and mixed gull species ( Catellicoccus marimammalium ) fecal sources were tested from water and sediment. Gene sequencing (16S rRNA) was used to identify similarities in bacterial communities in nearshore water , river inputs, sand, sediment, and groundwater. Synoptic surveys of water exchange were conducted to determine nearshore-offshore interactions of FIB. In addition to these MST studies, best management practices to mitigate FIB, including gull deterrence, slope grading, wetland establishment, and shoreline plantings, were reviewed for their effectiveness at reducing FIB concentrations over time. Using multiple tools for MST helped identify primary and secondary sources of FIB (gulls, stormwater inputs) and the physical processes that exacerbate FIB concentrations (onshore currents, limited circulation). Management actions were successful in the short-term at reducing FIB, but scope of success was temporally limited, with FIB concentrations often rebounding. Results highlight the usefulness of MST to inform best management practices and the need for a sustained adaptive approach that adjusts for changes in the coastal system. ]"

In Peru, fresh SGD is used for drinking, on Tahiti for bathing, in Greece for irrigation, in Bali for blessing, and already Alexander von Humboldt noted the danger for smaller vessels from a submarine spring off Cuba, but at which Manatees gathered and were hunted by fishermen. These are just a few of the presented examples, which document the complex value fresh submarine groundwater discharge has for coastal communities. Because global change will strongly affect this water resource we should assess and understand that value, before the phenomenon will disappear at many locations due to terrestrial groundwater extraction or sea level increase. ]"

Monitoring carbonate chemistry parameters over spatial and temporal scales is challenging, especially with limited resources. A lack of monitoring data can lead to a limited understanding of real-world conditions. Without such data, robust experimental and model design is challenging, and the identification and understanding of episodic acidification events is nearly impossible. We present considerations for resource managers, academia, and industry professionals who are currently developing acidification monitoring programs in the Mid-Atlantic region. We highlight the following considerations for deliberation: 1) leverage existing infrastructure to include multiple carbonate chemistry parameters as well as other water quality measurements, 2) direct monitoring efforts in subsurface waters rather than limiting monitoring to surface waters, 3) identify the best available sensor technology for long-term, in-situ monitoring, 4) monitor across a salinity gradient to account for the complexity of estuarine, coastal, and ocean environments, and identify potential areas of enhanced vulnerability, 5) increase sampling frequency to capture variability, 6) consider other drivers (e.g., freshwater discharge, nutrients, physiochemical parameters) that may affect acidification, and 7) conduct or continue monitoring in specific ecological and general regions that may have enhanced vulnerability. Through the incorporation of these considerations, individual monitoring programs can more efficiently and effectively leverage resources and build partnerships for a more comprehensive data collection in the region. While these considerations focus on the Mid-Atlantic region), similar strategies can be used to leverage resources in other locations. ]"

A critical appraisal on definitions, methodology and communication ]","[ Mangroves , saltmarsh plants and seagrasses grow in coastal areas near the land–ocean interface. Marine scientists normally identify the substratum in which these plants grow as sediments. For half a century, sediments supporting emergent vegetation have been described by pedologists and some ecologists as soils. However, more recently, some pedologists began to suggest that subtidal marine substrata should be “subaqueous soils.” This followed a change in the definition of soil in the 2 nd (1999) edition of Soil Taxonomy by the US Department of Agriculture. These developments have caused concerns among many coastal marine scientists, and have led to the emergence of serious and important questions which we address in this paper. We conclude that the terms “ sediment ” and “ soil ” to describe the substrata in coastal environments vegetated by mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass beds are not mutually exclusive. Coastal marine substrata will still be denoted sediments by most marine scientists. Pedologists should recognize and affirm the appropriateness of this historical convention, while they at the same time for specific purposes can use the term “soil” when justifiable according to the definition. Furthermore, research methodology must be appropriate to the environments under study and recognize the uniqueness of these water saturated and largely anoxic environments. This is critical to avoid flawed and incomparable results and to facilitate better communication among scientists working in the coastal zone. A mutual awareness and appreciation among involved communities will help to avoid confusion and improve the understanding among the marine and soil researchers studying these systems. We hope that these ideas can be adopted by the marine and terrestrial scientific communities and look forward to further cooperation through a continued positive dialogue. ]"

A brief review of two 'equilibrium profile' models (i.e., the Bruun and RDA models) is provided as a conceptual foundation before considering a range of complicating factors that are important to determining how sandy coasts may evolve in the future under rates of relative water level rise (RWLR) similar to recent increases in sea level. Key processes controlling beach-dune interaction are reviewed, especially the rates of morphodynamic action relative to the inundation potential driven by water level increases, leading to the conclusion that transgression distances due to RWLR are small in comparison to characteristic shoreline excursions driven by storm events and subsequent reconstruction phases. Much of the available evidence suggests that the beach and foredune (together with the nearshore profile) will migrate landward intact, keeping pace with relatively slow rates of RWLR similar in magnitude to those predicted by current sea-level scenarios. However, the documented response of shorelines in the Great Lakes to several episodes of relatively rapid rates of RWLR over a period of about a decade indicates that landward migration of the foredune through aeolian processes may be too slow to keep pace with this magnitude of shoreline transgression, and therefore the foredune will be over-run by the translating beach and nearshore profile. ]"

Monitoring ESs is therefore important for tracking subsequent decline or recovery. The development of new Earth Observation (EO) technologies and approaches involved in observing and analyzing data collected from remote sensing (RS) satellite/aircraft would make for a useful application: monitoring and mapping spatial distribution of ESs that seagrasses provide to marine ecosystems and human well-being. Unfortunately, current approaches greatly rely on spatial proxy measures to map distribution of ESs. Many of biophysical parameters are currently detectable by EO instruments, with relevance to ESs. This paper review the capabilities of advanced RS techniques for informing species diversity, growth traits, health condition, ecological processes, and water quality variables linking ESs and describe how these EO products can contribute to ES assessments. Incorporation of both the direct (seagrass extent) and indirect (water related ESs) estimates derived from EO data can now provide more direct estimates of seagrass ecosystem properties (seagrass habitat quality and biodiversity) influencing ESs than the spatial proxies presently in use and they can support in developing more mechanistic models in GIS framework and spatially explicit maps of ESs. The increasing range of EO system and data sets suitable for measuring ES indicators has potential to supporting integrated coastal land use planning. Because each ES indicator and service responds to the environment, there is no ‘one approach fits all’ solution. Selecting EO products, with required resolution to be analyzed will guide to improving mapping efforts. This work also shed lights to sensitize discussion about need of holistic methodologies, challenges, and to motivate an enhanced use of EO-based technology and data. The need for a multidisciplinary project team of ecologists, sociologists, biologists and RS experts has been suggested for proper identification of ES indicators and advanced analysis of EO data. By doing so, we anticipate rapid progress in satellite based ES assessment and characterization of ESs and, in turn, supporting conservation and management of coastal ecosystem. ]"

In the last 20 years, research by tsunami geologists in northeast Japan has focused on extending the record of tsunamis beyond the range of historical documents in the region, which span too little time to reveal much of the earthquake history over the last millennia. Along the coast of Hokkaido, recurrent sandy deposits are evidence of historical and prehistoric large tsunamis. At Kiritappu marsh, for example, at least 15 identified tsunami deposits occurred between 200 and 6,000 years ago. The spatial distribution of the most recent prehistoric tsunami deposit, that of the so-called 17th-century earthquake and tsunami, exceeds historical and recent tsunami inundations in eastern Hokkaido. Numerical simulations of this event require a multi-segment fault model with variable slip (Mw &gt; 8.8) encompassing both the Tokachi-oki and Nemuro-oki regions to reproduce the observed deposit distribution in eastern Hokkaido. The recurrence interval of such multi-segment earthquakes along the southern Kuril Trench is estimated to be 100–800 years based on tephrochronological and radiocarbon evidence. Tsunami deposits are also associated with historical earthquakes in 1843 and 1894 in eastern Hokkaido and with the 1640 Komagatake eruption in western Hokkaido. The 17th-century earthquake probably triggered postseismic coastal deformation. Diatom-based transfer functions suggest rapid subsidence before the event and gradual uplift afterward, and historical volcanic ash layers indicate that gradual postseismic uplift occurred over decades. A simple dislocation model can explain such gradual uplift as an aseismic fault extension after the 17th-century event. In the Tohoku region, a tsunami deposit associated with the 869 Jogan earthquake has been identified, and the inundation area of this event has been constrained based on the lateral extent of the tsunami deposit and its stratigraphic position beneath the historical To-a tephra (915 CE). Land-level changes at Odaka, Fukushima prefecture, associated with the Jogan event have been estimated based on changes of fossil diatom assemblages below and above the tsunami deposit. Numerical simulations based on geological evidence and observations of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami deposit suggest that the Jogan event was a plate-boundary rupture at least 200 km long along the Japan Trench (Mw &gt; 8.3–8.6). The 1454 Kyotoku tsunami is also considered to have been generated by a rupture area including the Miyagi-oki region (part of the Jogan rupture). It remains unclear whether the 869, 1454, and 2011 tsunamis were similar in size and source; if they were, the recurrence intervals of such events near Sendai are less than 600 years and more regular than those for multi-segment earthquakes along the Kuril Trench. ]"

We compiled data on the oxygen uptake of marine sediments with the objective to understand the constraints on mineralization rates of deposited organic matter and their relation to key environmental parameters. The compiled database includes nearly 4000 O 2 uptake data and is available as supplementary material. It includes also information on bottom water O 2 concentration, O 2 penetration depth, geographic position, water depth, and full information on the data sources. We present the different in situ and ex situ approaches to measure the total oxygen uptake (TOU) and the diffusive oxygen uptake (DOU) of sediments and discuss their robustness towards methodological errors and statistical uncertainty. We discuss O 2 transport through the benthic and diffusive boundary layers, the diffusion- and fauna-mediated O 2 uptake, and the coupling of aerobic respiration to anaerobic processes . Five regional examples are presented to illustrate the diversity of the seabed: Eutrophic seas, oxygen minimum zones, abyssal plains , mid-oceanic gyres , and hadal trenches. A multiple correlation analysis shows that seabed O 2 uptake is primarily controlled by ocean depth and sea surface primary productivity. The O 2 penetration depth scales with the DOU according to a power law that breaks down under the abyssal ocean gyres. The developed multiple correlation model was used to draw a global map of seabed O 2 uptake rates. Respiratory coefficients, differentiated for depth regions of the ocean, were used to convert the global O 2 uptake to organic carbon oxidation. The resulting global budget shows an oxidation of 212 Tmol C yr −1 in marine sediments with a 5-95% confidence interval of 175-260 Tmol C yr −1 . A comparison with the global flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) from photic surface waters to the deep sea, determined from multiple sediment trap studies, suggests a deficit in the sedimentation flux at 2000 m water depth of about 70% relative to the carbon turnover in the underlying seabed. At the ocean margins, the flux of organic carbon from rivers and from vegetated coastal ecosystems contributes greatly to the budget and may even exceed the phytoplankton production on the inner continental shelf . ]"

Extreme events such as tsunamis provide opportunities to evaluate biological rafting. Plastic debris is one of the most cited substrates for rafting. The main fouling organisms were Serpulidae, Bryozoans, Balanidae, and Ostreidae. Future studies should consider standardizing various methodological approaches. , One of the underestimated consequences of marine litter presence on marine environment is the transportation of fouling species on detritus – a process known as rafting. We undertook a review of articles concerning rafting published between 1970 and 2020 to identify patterns and potential areas of study that could contribute to directing future research. We observed in 53 publications an increase in rafting studies from the 1990s but fewer studies have been undertaken in the Southern Atlantic. The main fouling organisms were algae, barnacles, bryozoans , mollusks and polychaetes. The transport of those organisms over time and distances, and the volumes of material transported, have been very irregular, reflecting oceanic movements and detritus generating events acting at local, regional, or trans-oceanic scales. No standardized methodologies for collecting marine litter and identifying and quantifying their fouling were observed, but are suggested in this review, to allow more accurate future comparisons among different studies. ]"

Knowledge on these underwater forests is missing for parts of the Arctic. Global warming may lead to northern expansion of kelp forests in some areas. Other areas may lose kelps due to coastal erosion from melting land and sea ice. Predictions require a mechanistic, regional understanding of multiple stressors. , The Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing places on Earth and it is a sentinel region for understanding the range and magnitude of planetary changes, and their impacts on ecosystems. However, our understanding of arctic coastal ecosystems remains limited, and the impacts of ongoing and future climate change on them are largely unexplored. Kelp forests are the dominant habitat along many rocky Arctic coastlines, providing structure and food for economically and ecologically important species. Here we synthesize existing information on the distribution and diversity of arctic kelp forests and assess how ongoing changes in environmental conditions could impact the extent, productivity, and resilience of these important ecosystems. We identify regions where the range and growth of arctic kelp are likely to undergo rapid short-term increase due to reduced sea ice cover, increased light, and warming. However, we also describe areas where kelps could be negatively impacted by rising freshwater input and coastal erosion due to receding sea ice and melting permafrost. In some regions, arctic kelp forests have undergone sudden regime shifts due to altered ecological interactions or changing environmental conditions. Key knowledge gaps for arctic kelp forests include measures of extent and diversity of kelp communities (especially northern Canada and northeastern Russia), the faunal communities supported by many of these habitats, and the role of arctic kelp forests in structuring nearby pelagic and benthic food webs. Filling in these gaps and strategically prioritizing research in areas of rapid environmental change will enable more effective management of these important habitats, and better predictions of future changes in the coastal ecosystems they support and the services that they provide. ]"

Studies include on-site investigations, numerical modelling or experimental studies. However, inferences on past inundation processes based on commonly used inverse modelling approaches are associated with significant uncertainties and the need for validation of relevant parameters has been expressed. Here, we review experimental studies on the transport of natural boulders (and artificial bodies) by tsunamis, which provide crucial insights into the physical parameters controlling the transport process. We summarize and categorize the differences and scopes of existing experimental studies and point out the importance of the boulders' wave-facing area and, thus, the drag force, which is highlighted in most studies. The boulder-transport mode (e.g., rolling or sliding), however, varies strongly throughout the publications. A considerable number of influencing parameters is not investigated systematically (e.g., the influence of boulder-boulder interactions) so far, and there is an agreement that existing hydrodynamic equations for mobilization thresholds tend to overestimate the necessary wave height and velocity due to the existing uncertainties. Therefore, and based on the current knowledge, working with parameter ranges (e.g., mobilization thresholds, transport-distance spans) is recommended instead of using exact values. However, we demonstrate that comparisons of the particular findings of the reviewed studies is not straightforward due to very individual experimental setups. Based on this, we propose a standardized research environment, which might simplify the knowledge transfer between studies and can possibly improve numerical models for tsunami-induced boulder transport. ]"

The ANNs were used as surrogate models. Combined uses of optimization and simulation models were preferred recently. , The coastal aquifers of the world are facing environmental problem of seawater intrusion. This problem is the results of indiscriminate and unplanned groundwater exploitation for fulfilling the growing need of freshwater for the burgeoning global population. There is a need to develop appropriate management models for assessing the maximum feasible pumping rates which protects seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. The comprehensive reviews on the use of various programming techniques for the solution of seawater intrusion management problem of coastal aquifers have been provided in this paper. The literature review revealed that the management models used in the past mainly considered the objectives of maximization of pumping rate, minimization of drawdown, minimization of pumped water, minimization of seawater volume into the aquifer, and/or minimization of pumping cost. The past reviews are grouped into five sections based on the programming techniques adopted. The sections include: linear programming, nonlinear programming , genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks , and multiobjective optimization models.

The populations should be managed as separate groups. , Otolith composition (edge vs core: Mg/Ca, Mn/Ca, Zn/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca) by LA-ICP-MS and Elliptic Fourier analysis were integrated to evaluate spatial segregation of adult and juvenile stages of Genidens barbus from specimens collected from five coastal areas off Brazil (Paraíba do Sul River, Guanabara Bay, Itapanhaú River mouth, Paranaguá Bay), Argentina and Uruguay (La Plata Estuary). Fisheries of this diadromous catfish have largely collapsed in the southwest Atlantic coastal region due to overexploitation . An understanding of population structure is now critically needed for improved management strategies for this endangered species . PERMANOVA based on otolith edge chemistry showed significant differences ( p &lt; 0.05 ) between all sites, except Itapanhaú River and Paranaguá Bay. Shape, by comparison, found significant differences between all sampling sites, except Guanabara Bay and Paranaguá Bay, and Itapanhaú River and Paranaguá Bay. Discriminant analysis cross-classification success based on chemistry ranged from 33.3 (Paranaguá Bay) to 100% (La Plata Estuary), and 66.7 (Paranaguá Bay) to 100% (La Plata Estuary) for otolith edges (mean = 61.3%) and cores (mean = 78.9%), respectively. For otolith shape, the jackknifed rate (mean = 45.9%) was relatively low for all sites (32.1–44.7%) except La Plata Estuary (67.6%). Although we do not find otolith shape to be particularly useful; otolith microchemistry supports the presence of different management units.

The study of the Holocene evolution of the delta can provide information about its response to rapid sea-level rise and changes in sediment supply caused by climate or human activity, although this has yet to be fully explored because of the lack of integrated studies using age-constrained sedimentary records. Here we document stratigraphic architecture and morphological changes over the last 11,700 years and estimate the amount of sediment trapped in the delta region on a millennial scale using a dataset of 344 sediment cores , 658 radiocarbon and 28 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages (of which we obtained 64 cores, 345 radiocarbon and 28 OSL ages, and the others we sourced from the literature). Using this dataset we present the temporal and spatial morphodynamic evolution of the entire Yangtze River mouth from its early Holocene transgressive estuary to a mid- to late-Holocene regressive delta, making it possible to produce a quantitative and sequential analysis of sediment deposition. A destructive phase of the river mouth region was identified at 10 to 8 cal. kyr BP, including significant coastal erosion of tidal flats and troughs within the estuary and of tidal ridge-and-trough topography offshore; these resulted from the reshaping of the river mouth morphology caused by rapid sea-level rise at that time. As a result, the rate of sediment trapping at the river mouth declined from an average of 224 Mt yr −1 at 11.7–10 cal. kyr BP to 137 Mt yr −1 between 10 and 8 cal. kyr BP. Since delta initiation 8000 years ago, a retreat of the subaqueous delta occurred and the sediment trapping rate declined from 151 Mt yr −1 at 8–6 cal. kyr BP to 99–113 Mt yr −1 between 6 and 2 cal. kyr BP, caused by the reduction in sediment supply linked to summer monsoon weakening ~6000 years ago. In the last 2000 years the sediment trapping rate has increased to 162 Mt yr −1 due to intensified human activity. The present-day level of sedimentation in delta (49 Mt yr −1 in 2003–2011), after the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, is far lower than the ‘natural’ range in the Holocene . We thus infer a potential for system regime shift in terms of coastal erosion and a transition to a new equilibrium in delta morphology in the near future. ]"

Some environments have not fully recovered or have become stable with some different status. By contrast to the short-lasting tsunami impact, long-lasting crustal movement and reconstruction projects, together with the nuclear power plant accident in the area have strongly affected human society and local coastal environments in a long-term. Investigation reveals that damage outlooks adopted before the 2011 event differed at the prefectural level based on limited knowledge and awareness of the prior 400 years (mainly 120 years). Knowledge, awareness, and reconstruction work undertaken after the 1896, 1933, and 1960 tsunamis were effective to a certain degree during the 2011 tsunami, especially in northern Tohoku. However, past memories of large tsunami disasters in southern Tohoku such as the 869 and 1611 events were lost to the public to a degree that tsunami awareness and countermeasures were insufficient. Although post-2011 governmental policy has been designed to prepare for maximum possible earthquake and tsunami occurrence in the future, no consensus exists of how to forecast such events. Remarkable post-seismic crustal movement has continued. Seismologic and paleotsunami studies have projected a high risk of future large earthquakes and tsunamis surrounding the 2011 source region along the Japan Trench. Considering that low-frequency but large tsunamis have caused extraordinarily intensive and extensive damage, studies based on geology, archaeology, and history are invaluable for elucidating tsunami phenomena and forming accurate risk assessments. In fact, although many historical and geological studies have been conducted along the many coasts of Japan after the 2011 event, no evidence has been provided about extremely large tsunami waves , which greatly exceeded the knowledge available before 2011. Ten years is an extremely short period on a geologic timescale, but it is sufficiently long for the general public to lose their disaster memories gradually. How can we continuously remind public people about such low-frequency tsunami events? How can we foster a social consensus to prepare for them? These issues, which were crucially important before the 2011 event, remain unsolved today. ]"

Achieving adequate management and protection of natural assets as ecosystems and their services, habitats, biodiversity requires that the socio-economic and human security needs of the coastal populations are met. One way to reach the goal is to enable them, representing about 50% of the global population and increasing, to fight poverty and cope with uncertainties and changing conditions of employment, environment and sustainability through proper governance of the coastal and ocean assets. This includes provision of education and knowledge as regards these assets and their proper uses. They include energy, water, food, transportation and trade, communication, coastal developments, tourism, recreation and ecosystem services, as well as the need to properly manage them. The present economic system cannot fully harmonize with the required governance, partly since the ecosystem resources and services are not internalised in the market-oriented system. This calls for a revised education and training system, more comprehensive than the present, taking into account the social, cultural and environmental requirements, and stressing the sustainable development paradigm. In order to achieve ocean governance and comprehensive human security an understanding of the system is needed. This is substantiated through the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development as well as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. The aim here is to discuss some of the issues in context of implementation of related ocean conventions and commitments, which include achieving ocean governance, and to elucidate opportunities given by oceans and coasts, also in generating employment and providing for basic human needs. ]"

This paper reviews current understanding of paleovalley systems from the perspective of Quaternary analogs and experimental studies. Paleovalley systems can include distinct mixed bedrock–alluvial, coastal-plain, and cross-shelf segments. Mixed bedrock–alluvial segments are long-lived, cut across bedrock of significantly older age, and have an overall degradational architecture. By contrast, coastal-plain and cross-shelf segments are non-equilibrium responses to high-frequency cycles of relative sea-level change: most coastal-plain and cross-shelf segments form as a geometric response to relative sea-level fall, as river systems cut through coastal-plain and inner shelf clinothems, and extend basinward to track the shoreline . After incision and cross-shelf extension, lateral channel migration and contemporaneous channel-belt deposition creates a valley-scale feature. Coastal-plain and cross-shelf paleovalley widths are set by the number of channel-belt sandbodies deposited during this time. Paleovalley systems play a key role in source-to-sink sediment routing. Early views included the model of incision and complete sediment bypass in response to relative sea-level fall. However, this model does not stand up to empirical, theoretical, or experimental scrutiny. Instead, there is a complex dynamic between incision, deposition, and sediment export from an evolving valley: periods of incision correspond with sediment export minima, whereas periods of lateral migration and channel-belt construction result in increased flux to the river mouth. Sediment export from evolving valleys, and merging of drainages during cross-shelf transit, play key roles in sediment transfer to the shelf-margin and genetically-linked slope to basin-floor systems. Connection between the river mouth and the shelf margin likely occurs for different periods of time depending on gradient of the river and shelf, as well as amplitude of high-frequency sea-level changes. Late Quaternary analogs and experimental studies provide an alternative sequence-stratigraphic interpretation for paleovalley systems. In coastal-plain paleovalleys, basal valley-fill surfaces meet criteria for an unconformity and a classically-defined sequence boundary: however, this surface is mostly everywhere of the same age as overlying fluvial deposits , and does not correspond to a long period of incision and sediment bypass. In cross-shelf paleovalleys, the basal contact between fluvial and deltaic or shoreface deposits is commonly interpreted as a sequence boundary, but is not an unconformity characterized by incision and sediment bypass. Instead, this surface is a facies contact that separates genetically-related fluvial and deltaic strata: the surface that correlates to the basal valley-fill surface within the coastal-plain paleovalley dips below cross-shelf prograding deltaic and/or shoreface strata, which are fed by deposition within the evolving valley itself, and should be the downlap surface. Many issues deserve attention in the future. We have stressed understanding the inherent scales and physical processes that operate during the formation and evolution of paleovalley systems. We also suggest the relative roles of allogenic forcing vs. autogenic dynamics, and the potential significance of high-frequency isostatic adjustments should be topics for future discussion. ]"

In the present study, we describe physical, taxonomic and functional differences in the plankton community in Young Sound, a NE Greenland fjord, from the inner fjord close to the GIS towards the coastal region in late summer. The fjord is influenced by runoff from land-terminating glaciers that separated the surface layer from cold underlying waters. The highest chlorophyll a concentration (&lt;2.5 μg l −1 ) was found in the coastal region at 20–50 m depth. The most profound difference in the mesozooplankton community structure along the section was seen in the abundance of the copepods Microcalanus spp., which were present in the coastal region in the upper 100 m, and Pseudocalanus spp., which only occurred in the surface layers and mainly in the inner part of the fjord. In addition to this, both species have been observed to change in abundance within the last decade. Calanus spp. copepods made up &gt; 74.9% of the total copepod biomass at all stations, and their grazing impact was the highest among the copepod groups. Copepod grazing impact on the phytoplankton standing stock, however, was exceeded by microzooplankton grazing, investigated by dilution experiments, with the highest grazing impact on the phytoplankton standing stock of 63% d −1 in the inner part of the fjord. In spite of high phytoplankton instantaneous growth rates at the innermost fjord station, proto-zooplankton was capable of controlling the phytoplankton production. The study showed functional differences within the system and provides indications of how dynamic the coastal ecosystem of Greenland can be. ]"

Pitfalls of this concept relate to the definition of parasequence boundaries as lithological discontinuities that mark episodes of abrupt water deepening. With this general meaning, ‘flooding surfaces’ may be facies contacts within transgressive deposits, or may coincide with different types of sequence stratigraphic surfaces (maximum regressive, transgressive ravinement, or maximum flooding). In all cases, flooding surfaces are allostratigraphic contacts restricted to coastal and shallow-water settings, where evidence of abrupt water deepening can be demonstrated. Flooding surfaces may also be absent from the shallow-water systems, where conformable successions accumulate during gradual water deepening. It follows that (1) parasequences have smaller extent than systems tracts, and (2) systems tracts do not always consist of stacked parasequences. These limitations prevent the dependable use of the parasequence concept in sequence stratigraphy . Advances in high-resolution sequence stratigraphy show that the scales of sequences and parasequences are not mutually exclusive; the two types of units define different approaches to the delineation of stratigraphic cycles at high-resolution scales. Sequences that develop at parasequence scales provide a more reliable alternative for correlation, both within and outside of the coastal and shallow-water settings, rendering parasequences obsolete. Every transgression that affords the formation of a flooding surface starts from a maximum regressive surface and ends with a maximum flooding surface observed at the scale of that transgression. These systems tract boundaries are invariably more extensive than any facies contacts that may form during the transgression. Flooding surfaces remain relevant to the description of facies relationships, but their stratigraphic meaning needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The use of sequences and systems tracts in high-resolution studies provides consistency in methodology and nomenclature at all stratigraphic scales, irrespective of geological setting and the types and resolution of the data available. ]"

Previous studies of the equatorial coast of Brazil have led to the recognition of extensive Oligo-Miocene and Miocene marine-influenced deposits, but these deposits have been overlooked in other coastal areas of Brazil. The aim of the present study is to show the origin and evolution of late Oligocene and Miocene marine-influenced strata exposed in more than 5000 km of coastal areas along the WNW-trending equatorial and NNE-trending eastern Brazilian continental margins . We review the most relevant data concerning the strata of these ages exposed along the equatorial and eastern margins of Brazil, and combine them with new data. Based on these occurrences, we analyze the history of sea-level fluctuations and show that marine-influenced strata are more widespread in these margins than originally thought. Our main results indicate that a marine influence is not only imprinted in the deposits exposed along the equatorial margin, but it is also widespread in several areas of the eastern margin. For a long geological time interval ranging from the end of the Cretaceous or Paleogene up to the late Oligocene , most of the Brazilian coast remained a non-depositional site exposed to subaerial erosion and lateritic soil development. The combination of sea-level rise and tectonic subsidence promoted sediment accumulation in the onshore portion of several basins. Two transgressive episodes occurred: one in the Oligo-Miocene and another in the early/middle Miocene. The latter gave rise to deposition of the Barreiras Formation. However, during the supposedly middle Miocene eustatic sea-level highstand in coastal Brazil, there was a renewed and extensive phase of non-deposition and subaerial erosion with lateritic soil formation, a process that lasted up to the Late Quaternary. This mismatching of the sedimentary record with other South American and continental areas is discussed herein. As in many other areas of South America and of the world, the regressive–transgressive events recorded along the Brazilian coast most likely responded to a combination of eustatic sea-level fluctuations and local factors such as tectonic activity, intraplate stresses and changes in dynamic topography during the post-rift history of the eastern South American Plate. ]"

This is especially the case as urbanization continues in the coastal zone across much of the tropics. However, the drivers of urban mangrove rehabilitation may differ from rural locations, related to replacing habitats lost due to development, or utilizing the wave attenuation function of mangroves to improve the coastal defence of urban assets. Urban mangrove rehabilitation also faces several unique challenges that may not apply to rural rehabilitation projects, particularly related to space constraints and the need to utilize novel spaces and habitats that may be less suitable for mangrove establishment. The tropical nation of Singapore is used as a case study to investigate the various drivers of urban mangrove rehabilitation and the current and future status of rehabilitation projects across the nation. Singapore is also used to highlight the potential for novel mangrove rehabilitation solutions along urban coastlines, particularly the role of novel habitats and ecological engineering, and rehabilitation funding through Corporate Social Responsibility .

As Forbes, Parkes, Manson, and Ketch have stressed, exceptional storms play a major role because, among other effects, wave power is a quadratic function of wave height; surges associated with such exceptional storms raise the level of wave attack on the shore; higher water levels enable waves of a given size to shoal and penetrate farther landward; setup, run-up, overtopping, and overwash are enhanced during storms; more energetic near-bed current velocities and shear stresses occur during storms; and the foregoing effects can produce exceptionally high sediment transport rates and rapid profile change. Processes generated by exceptional storms include shoreface sediment mobilization and adjustment of the nearshore profile, beach, dune and cliff erosion, barrier breaching and overwash, and longshore modifications that may affect tidal inlets .

Ocean acidification and pollution facilitate each other. Pollution-affected respiration acidifies ocean more than carbon dioxide uptake. Coastal regions are more vulnerable to the negative impact of ocean acidification. , Ocean acidification and pollution coexist to exert combined effects on the functions and services of marine ecosystems. Ocean acidification can increase the biotoxicity of heavy metals by altering their speciation and bioavailability. Marine pollutants, such as heavy metals and oils, could decrease the photosynthesis rate and increase the respiration rate of marine organisms as a result of biotoxicity and eutrophication, facilitating ocean acidification to varying degrees. Here we review the complex interactions between ocean acidification and pollution in the context of linkage of multiple stressors to marine ecosystems. The synthesized information shows that pollution-affected respiration acidifies coastal oceans more than the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Coastal regions are more vulnerable to the negative impact of ocean acidification due to large influxes of pollutants from terrestrial ecosystems. Ocean acidification and pollution facilitate each other, and thus coastal environmental protection from pollution has a large potential for mitigating acidification risk. ]"

Detection and documentation of hurricane signatures in coastal deposits are becoming instrumental in attempts to reconstruct mid and late Holocene storm climate history. Subsurface exploration and field studies on the NE Gulf coast and data gleaned from the literature suggest the need for a complex approach that provides well-documented details of coastal landscape evolution. Until recently, prehistoric hurricanes and their intensity levels have been automatically interpreted from the frequency and thickness of sand layers in muddy paralic deposits. However, in addition to wind velocity, several hydro-, aerodynamic, and other factors a wide range of stratigraphic conditions, topographic setting, and sand sources also determine variations in the extent and intensity of storm flooding, erosion, transfer, and deposition of sand layers in small paralic basins. Inherent limitations in these sedimentary records and their interpretation must be overcome in order to improve local hurricane chronologies and establish interregional correlations. Before sedimentary and chemical signatures are accepted as diagnostic indicators of overwash especially by “catastrophic” hurricanes, alternative causes must also be considered. A parallel scale of storm flood-level stages should supplement the Saffir–Simpson hurricane categories. The relationship between storm intensities and flooding elevations is highly complex. Changes in sea-level, shore positions, formation and extinction of preexisting incised valley networks, the impact of transgression and regression processes on estuaries and their deposits play determining roles in setting the stage for overwash processes. Strandplain progradation followed by erosive shore retreat played a key role in framing certain paralic lakes. Without overwash, sand layers and marine microfossils may be also emplaced by storm-driven currents that enter unobstructed estuaries, inlets and storm breaches. Bioturbation also distorts the storm record. Significant lateral variations in the number and thickness of intercalated sand layers at closely adjacent sites suggest the importance of local differences in sources, transport and preservation processes; in the dimensions, relative positions and accessibility of sand resources inside and adjacent to coastal basins. Variations in the number, thickness, and ages of sand laminae, may not be related to the number of storms and their intensities. This may impair correlations between regionally interpreted “calm” and “intensive” phases. In partial overlap with an assumed “quiescent” storm phase, stable isotope ratios in lacustrine muds impacted by salt water influx reveal frequent hurricane activity during the last 1.5 ka as well. By mimicking effects of reduced storminess, the fewer and thinner sand laminae deposited between ~ 7.0 and 3.4 ka B.P. may be attributed to greater distances of estuarine landward transport by storm tidal currents at times of lower sea-levels. ]"

Classical escarpment features are the subject of many studies in these settings while other morphologies that characterize this tectonic environment receive less attention. The case of the Brazilian South Atlantic margin, a continental-scale topographically pronounced terrain covering &gt;1000 km of the western South Atlantic rifted margin, is not an exception. Most landscape evolution studies concentrate on the Serra do Mar escarpment system, while other segments with no escarpments have received less attention. Various authors assume the Brazilian elevated continental margin as a well-defined and continuous marginal upwarp instead of a diversified and more complex landscape. Here we debate this issue and explore how the first-order topographic forms and time-space denudation patterns differ along the Brazilian South Atlantic margin. We focus on the continental margin of southeast Brazil (CMSEB) that includes a southern segment featured by a prominent escarpment system and a northern segment where the seaward-facing steep escarpment is absent. We show that, similar to other RCMs, the CMSEB presents a continental drainage divide separating two distinct regions with contrasting denudation patterns, (i) an inland continental interior , characterized by high elevation and relatively low relief with a predominance of apatite fission track (AFT) ages significantly older than South Atlantic rifting event, and (ii) a coastal region characterized by low elevations and high relief with the predominance AFT ages younger than the rifting. However, besides the differential denudation associated with the South Atlantic opening, the margin has experienced substantial post-rift exhumation attributed to rock uplift triggered by the reactivation of inherited basement structures. The morphological differences between CMSEB's southern and northern extensions reflect sectors with contrasting geomorphic evolution supporting the idea that the rifted Brazilian RCM is not a single and continuous tectonic setting . Finally, our findings indicate that tectonic inheritance strongly impacts the denudation pattern, which contributes to the geomorphic diversification along the Brazilian RCM. ]"

After the relative magmatic quiescence at ca. 210–180 Ma, magmatic activities were mainly developed in the interior of SE China with an areal distribution and subsequently concentrated in the present coastal area with an overall linear pattern after ca. 140 Ma except the Lower Yangtze region. The spatiotemporal change requires a unique crust-mantle geodynamic coupling with the evolution of deep crustal hot zones from intracontinental to continent marginal setting. Correspondingly, the magmatic rocks show a compositional change from bimodal distribution in Early and Middle Jurassic to unimodal and weakly bimodal pattern in Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. In general, most of the Late Mesozoic intermediate to felsic magmatic rocks show higher Mg# than typical rifting-related rocks at given SiO 2 , which requires the addition of water and possible mass transfer and mixing of underplated hydrous basaltic magma in the deep crustal hot zones. The occurrence of high-Sr/Y and La/Yb rocks and possibly thickened crust (ca. 40 km) before ca. 140 Ma, combined with the current thin crust thickness (ca. 31-33 km) as revealed by seismic data, indicates a widespread crustal thinning after ca. 140 Ma. The relatively thickened crust before ca. 140 Ma is beneficial for melting of underlying old crust that is composed of dominantly Neoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic components, the formation of porphyritic Cu deposits, the subsequent magmatic differentiation and associated giant W, Sn, Nb, Ta and Li ore deposits. In contrast, the deep crustal hot zones progressively migrated to the present coastal area after ca. 140 Ma, driving the increasing amounts of intermediate rocks and intermediate-felsic volcanic rocks. In general, the diversity and compositional change of Late Mesozoic magmatic rocks and associated ore deposits in SE China may be controlled by the evolution of deep crustal hot zones in different tectonic settings in response to the subduction of Paleo-Pacific Plate. ]"

Recent evidence suggests that alongshore variations in pre-Holocene geology of barrier islands modify nearshore hydrodynamic processes and sediment transport , ultimately affecting how barrier islands will respond to relative sea-level rise. Explorations of Holocene barrier island geology are usually based on cores to supplement bathymetric, onshore/offshore seismic and/or ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys. The advantages and limitations of these methods with respect to barrier island investigations are briefly described in this review. Alternative near-surface geophysical methods including electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors are increasingly being used for coastal research because they are non-invasive, provide continuous subsurface information across a variety of sub-environments, and are capable of characterizing large areas in a short time. Although these EMI sensors have shown promise in coastal applications, a number of issues primarily related to subsurface hydrology need to be addressed to fully assess the limitations of this technique. This paper reviews the theory, methodology and applications of EMI in support of geologic framework studies with particular reference to barrier islands. Resolution of these issues will allow EMI sensors to complement and offer significant advantages over traditional methods in support of an improved understanding of large-scale barrier island evolution. ]"

Summarises the oceanography of a thicker OMZ in the AS than in the BoB. Lucicutia grandis is an indicator of the lower boundary of OMZ in the AS. Calanoides carinatus is a diapausing species of OMZ in the AS. A severe lack of information exists on OMZ copepods in the BoB. , The Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are cul-de-sacs of the northern Indian Ocean, and they contain more than half of the world's Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs). The current study reviews the vast and advancing literature on the oceanographic settings that lead to distinct OMZs in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal and links them with the copepods thriving there, their status, and likely adaptations. The Arabian Sea has a thicker perennial subsurface OMZ (∼1000 m) than the Bay of Bengal (∼500 m), which is linked to high plankton production via upwelling and winter convection in the former and river influx and mesoscale eddies in the latter. Studies world over show that OMZs adversely affect the zooplankton community as their core always sustains reduced zooplankton biomass. Exclusive studies on copepods in the perennial OMZ in the northern Indian Ocean have been limited to the Arabian Sea so far, which showed that the calanoid copepod Lucicutia grandis is an indicator species of the OMZ lower boundary, whereas Calanoides natalis is a diapausing species in the OMZ. Studies also evidenced that many calanoids ( Pleuromamma indica , Lucicutia longicornis , Rhincalanus nasutus , Paracalanus aculeatus , Eucalanus attenuatus , Euchaeta rimana , Subeucalanus subcrassus ), cyclopoids ( Oithona nana , Oncaea conifera , Oncaea subtilis , Saphirina ), Harpacticoids ( Microsetella sp., Aegisthus mucronatus ) and Mormonilloids ( Mormonilla minor ) living in the perennial OMZ are either vertical migrators or having a patchy distribution between the epipelagic to the deeper OMZ stratum. These OMZ copepods are believed to have distinctive growth and reproductive traits that allow them to exist in the OMZs. Their high enzyme activity allows them to carry out vertical migration, their high lipid reserves allow them to stay alive in starving conditions, and their slow lifestyle reduces their energy consumption in deeper OMZs. Unlike the perennial OMZs in the Arabian Sea, copepods in the seasonal OMZs in the coastal upwelling zones are almost unexplored, except for a recent attempt that demonstrated that cyclopoids have better survival strategies there. The Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal around India have a strong seasonal exchange of their water masses, but how they influence and shape the copepod communities in these regions and the OMZs they harbour is completely unknown. ]"

Along-margin temporal correlations are used to identify past subduction earthquakes. Upper plate faults introduce uncertainty in earthquake source interpretation. We identify ten possible subduction earthquakes in the past 7000 years. , The Hikurangi subduction margin, New Zealand, has not produced large subduction earthquakes within the short written historic period (~180 years) and the potential of the plate interface to host large (M &gt; 7) to great (M &gt; 8) earthquakes and tsunamis is poorly constrained. The geological record of past subduction earthquakes offers a method for assessing the location, frequency and approximate magnitude of subduction earthquakes to underpin seismic and tsunami hazard assessments. We review evidence of Holocene coseismic coastal deformation and tsunamis at 22 locations along the margin. A consistent approach to radiocarbon age modelling is used and earthquake and tsunami evidence is ranked using a systematic assessment of the quality of age control and the certainty that the event in question is an earthquake. To identify possible subduction earthquakes, we use temporal correlation of earthquakes, combined with the type of earthquake evidence, likely primary fault source and the earthquake certainty ranking. We identify 10 past possible subduction earthquakes over the past 7000 years along the Hikurangi margin. The last subduction earthquake occurred at 520–470 years BP in the southern Hikurangi margin and the strongest evidence for a full margin rupture is at 870–815 years BP. There are no apparent persistent rupture patches, suggesting segmentation of the margin is not strong. In the southern margin, the type of geological deformation preserved generally matches that expected due to rupture of the interseismically locked portion of the subduction interface but the southern termination of past subduction ruptures remains unresolved. The pattern of geological deformation on the central margin suggests that the region of the interface that currently hosts slow slip events also undergoes rupture in large earthquakes, demonstrating different modes of slip behaviour occur on the central Hikurangi margin. Evidence for subduction earthquakes on the northern margin has not been identified because deformation signals from upper plate faults dominate the geological record. Large uncertainties remain in regard to evidence of past subduction earthquakes on the Hikurangi margin, with the greatest challenges presented by temporal correlation of earthquake evidence when working within the uncertainties of radiocarbon ages, and the presence of upper plate faults capable of producing deformation and tsunamis similar to that expected for subduction earthquakes. However, areas of priority research such as improving the paleotsunami record and integration of submarine turbidite records should produce significant advances in the future. ]"

As a result, understanding of geomorphic systems is often scale-constrained due to a host of methodological, logistical, and theoretical factors that limit the scope of how Earth scientists study landforms and broader landscapes. This paper reviews recent advances in understanding of the geomorphology of beach-dune systems derived from over a decade of collaborative research from Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. A comprehensive summary of key findings is provided from short-term experiments embedded within a decade-long monitoring program and a multi-decadal reconstruction of coastal landscape change. Specific attention is paid to the challenges of scale integration and the contextual limitations research at specific spatial and/or temporal scales imposes. A conceptual framework is presented that integrates across key scales of investigation in geomorphology and is grounded in classic ideas in Earth surface sciences on the effectiveness of formative events at different scales. The paper uses this framework to organize the review of this body of research in a ‘scale aware’ way and, thereby, identifies many new advances in knowledge on the form and function of subaerial beach-dune systems. Finally, the paper offers a synopsis of how greater understanding of the complexities at different scales can be used to inform the development of predictive models, especially those at a temporal scale of decades to centuries, which are most relevant to coastal management issues. Models at this (landform) scale require an understanding of controls that exist at both ‘landscape’ and ‘plot’ scales. Landscape scale controls such as sea level change , regional climate, and the underlying geologic framework essentially provide bounding conditions for independent variables such as winds, waves, water levels, and littoral sediment supply. Similarly, a holistic understanding of the range of processes, feedbacks, and linkages at the finer plot scale is required to inform and verify the assumptions that underly the physical modelling of beach-dune interaction at the landform scale. ]"

The Kongling and Kunming-Hainan domains are characterized by isolated Archean to early Paleoproterozoic rock units and events and crop out in northern and southern South China, respectively. The Kunming-Hainan Domain is preserved in three spatially separated regions at Kunming (southwestern South China), along the Ailaoshan shear zone, and within Hainan Island. Both domains were affected by late Paleoproterozoic tectonothermal events, indicating their likely juxtaposition by this time to form the proto-Yangtze Block. Late Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic sedimentary and igneous rock units developed on the proto-Yangtze Block, especially in its southern portions, and help link the rock units that formed along the shear zone at Ailaoshan and on Hainan Island into a single, spatially unified unit prior to Paleozoic to Cenozoic structural disaggregation and translation. The Wuyi Domain consists of late Paleoproterozoic rock units within a NE-SW trending, fault-bounded block in eastern South China. The Coastal Domain lies east of the Wuyi domain and is inferred to constitute a structurally separate block. Basement to the domain is not exposed, but zircon Hf model ages from Mesozoic granites suggest Mesoproterozoic basement at depth. The Archean to Paleoproterozoic tectonothermal record of the Kongling and Kunming-Hainan domains corresponds closely with that of NW Laurentia , suggesting all were linked, probably in association with assembly and subsequent partial fragmentation of the Nuna supercontinent. Furthermore, the age and character of Mesoproterozoic magmatism and detrital zircon signature of sedimentary rocks in the proto-Yangtze Block matches well with western Laurentia and eastern Australia-Antarctica. In particular, the detrital zircon signature of late Paleoproterozoic to early Mesoproterozoic sedimentary units in the block (e.g. Dongchuan Group) share a similar age spectrum with the Wernecke Supergroup of northwest Laurentia. This, together with similarities in the type and age of Fe-Cu mineralization in the domain with that in eastern Australia-Antarctica, especially northeast Australia, suggests a location adjacent to northwest Laurentia, southern Siberia , and northeast Australia within the Nuna supercontinent. The timing and character of late Paleoproterozoic magmatic activity in the Wuyi domain along with age of detrital zircons in associated sedimentary rocks matches the record of northern India. During rifting between Australia–Antarctica and Laurentia in the late Mesoproterozoic, the proto-Yangtze Block remained linked to northeast Australia. During accretionary orogenesis in the early Neoproterozoic, the proto-Yangtze Block assembled with the Wuyi Domain along the northern margin of India. The Coastal domain likely accreted at this time forming the South China Craton. Displacement of the Hainan and Ailaoshan assemblages from southwest of the Kunming assemblage likely occurred in the Cenozoic with the activation of the Ailaoshan-Red River fault system but could have begun in the early to mid-Paleozoic based on evidence for tectonothermal events in the Hainan assemblage. ]"

We find consensus amongst studies regarding an increase of the mean significant wave height H ¯ s H ¯ s across the Southern Ocean , tropical eastern Pacific and Baltic Sea, and conversely, a decrease of H ¯ s H ¯ s over the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, we observe that projections of H ¯ s H ¯ s over the eastern north Pacific and southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans lack consensus. Similarly, future projections of extreme H s lack consensus everywhere, except for the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic. We note a distinct lack of research regarding projected changes in wave direction which is of critical importance particularly for the mitigation of coastal hazards. Furthermore, we observe that the projection uncertainty surrounding wind-wave climate projections has been poorly sampled. Subsequently, we identify sets of coordinated experiments within existing studies that can be used as a basis to systematically quantify these uncertainties. Lastly, we recommend a shift towards a systematic, community-based framework (as propose by the COWCLIP) to foster concerted efforts and to better inform the wide range of relevant decisions across ocean and coastal adaption and mitigation assessments. ]"

A cradle of ancient civilisations, the Mediterranean has seen its shores occupied by Humans since Prehistory, and is, therefore, a particularly pertinent unit of analysis. The morphotectonic context and other forcing agents (e.g., climate) shaped out a highly diversified coastal morphology and generated a sediment-supply regime potentially favourable to the formation of numerous open-coast deltas and bay-head deltas in infilled rias as sea level stabilised during the mid-Holocene. This supply of riverine sediment has also been the key agent in mediating human occupation of the Mediterranean's clastic coasts. Expressions of this relationship have been extensively archived in clastic coastal deposits, including base-level deltaic and estuarine sedimentary sinks, which comprise records to explore the interactions between geosystems and the human environment. The stratigraphic sequences in these coastal sedimentary archives comprise, in many places, a clearly identified anthropogenic signature, notably in ancient harbours, some of which underwent extremely rapid silting up due to massive sediment sourcing generated by new agricultural practices from the Neolithic onwards. Increasing human influence, especially over the last 3000 years, has been, in turn, an important driver of changes in sediment supply, strongly modulating deltaic development. Pulses of sediment supply from catchments rendered vulnerable by human perturbations during the Roman period resulted in a new cycle of inception of many other deltas and in rapid delta growth (e.g. the Ebro, the Po, the Arno and the Ombrone). Another progradation dynamic during the Little Ice Age , at a time of strong rural population growth, river discharge increases, technological developments, and urbanisation, further consolidated delta growth. Understanding the life cycle of these deltas since their initial formation is, in turn, key to unravelling the relative role of natural and anthropogenic forcing agents. Rapid climate changes are deemed to have contributed through both the stripping of landscapes rendered fragile by human activities and active fluvial sediment transport to the coast, but disentangling climate change effects from human impacts in the Mediterranean remains a challenge. The patterns of subsequent deltaic growth and delta morphodynamics reflect adaptations to pulsed sediment supply, river discharge variations, the microtidal, fetch-limited context of the Mediterranean, and direct engineering interventions. The progradation dynamic of the Roman period and Little Ice Age contrasts markedly with the situation of common coastal destabilisation over the last two centuries, particularly well documented for the last 50 years. This period has been characterised by reduced sediment flux to base-level geosystems due to catchment reforestation, retenion within reservoirs, fluvial regulation and dredging , resulting in the erosion of deltas and barrier–lagoon and beach–dune systems. Large stretches of shoreline and narrow coastal plains have been massively engineered for coastal defence and protection against erosion, but also for the construction of marinas, leisure harbours and artificial beaches, resulting in the emergence of veritable artificial seafronts. These interventions have, collectively and progressively, raised societies to a pervasive and overarching position in the geomorphic stability–instability of the Mediterranean's coasts, a situation that will be exacerbated by pressures from sea-level rise, paving the way for rampant coastal erosion and delta destruction. ]"

Thus, DOM also supports primary production, both directly (osmotrophy) and indirectly (via remineralization). 3) Flocculation and subsequent deposition of terrestrial DOM within river estuaries may contribute to production and oxygen consumption in coastal sediments . 4) Chromophoric DOM, which is one of the major absorbers of light entering the Baltic Sea, contributes highly to water color, thus affecting the photosynthetic depth as well as recreational value of the Baltic Sea. Despite its large-scale importance to the Baltic Sea ecosystem, DOM has been of minor interest compared with inorganic nutrient loadings. Information on the concentrations and dynamics of DOM in the Baltic Sea has accumulated since the late 1990s, but it is still sporadic.

The most robust data provide a unique synthesis of 20 ka of palaeoenvironmental change at sub-regional scales. We find that Arabian environmental change does not necessarily follow broad narratives of ‘wet’ or ‘dry’ states but rather the climatic signal is a mosaic of substantial landscape heterogeneity. SCAPE also highlights regions in which more high-quality geochronological investigation is warranted to refine both temporal and spatial records, signifying important avenues for future research. ]"

Rates and dominant processes vary depending on time scale and morphological unit. Sand supply from the lower shoreface is more widespread than commonly believed. Predictions of coastal response depend on sediment flux pathways and budgets. , Findings from nearly two decades of research focused on the Columbia River littoral cell (CRLC), a set of rapidly prograding coastal barriers and strand-plains in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, are synthesized to investigate the morphodynamics associated with prograding beaches. Due to a large sediment supply from the Columbia River, the CRLC is the only extensive stretch of shoreline on the U.S. west coast to have advanced significantly seaward during the late Holocene . Since the last Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake in 1700, with associated co-seismic subsidence and tsunami, much of the CRLC has prograded hundreds of meters. However, the rates of progradation , and the processes most responsible for sediment accumulation, vary depending on time scale and the morphological unit in question. Remarkably, the 20th and early 21st century shoreline change rates were more than double the late prehistoric rates that include recovery from the last major CSZ event, most likely due to an increase in sediment supply resulting from inlet jetty construction. In some locations detailed beach morphology monitoring reveals that at interannual- to decadal-scale the upper shoreface aggraded about 2 cm/yr, subtidal sandbars migrated offshore and decayed while intertidal bars migrated onshore and welded to the shoreline, the shoreline prograded about 4 m/yr, and 1 to 2 new foredune ridges were generated. A detailed meso-scale sediment budget analysis in one location within the littoral cell shows that approximately 100 m 3 /m/yr accumulated between − 12 m (seaward limit of data) and + 9 m (crest of landward-most foredune). Gradients in alongshore sediment transport , net onshore-directed cross-shore sediment transport within the surf zone , and cross-shore feeding from a shoreface out of equilibrium with forcing conditions are each partially responsible for the significant rates of sediment supplied to the beaches and dunes of the CRLC during the observational period. Direct observations of beach progradation at seasonal- to decadal-scale are put in context of measured or inferred changes over time scales of decades to centuries. ]"

Solid waste management inadequacy in Indonesia take part as a major factor contributes to plastic pollution. The most polluted area by plastic was Java Island and it related to the impact of dense population in this area. Factors which contribute to plastic pollution are: limited SW management facilities, high SW load, and accessibility problem. , Plastic pollution has become a major concern in Indonesian coast and marine environment today. It occurs because 14% of the solid waste (SW) components in this country is plastic, and the SW management (SWM) infrastructure and services are still limited. The objectives of this article are to discuss the improper SWM and its impact to plastic pollution in Indonesia. Ten plastic pollution studies concerning macroplastics (MaP) and microplastics (MP) were described. These studies covered 5 regions, namely Java, East Nusa Tenggara, East Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, North and Southwest Sumatera. The highest MP abundance of 37,440–38,790 particles/kg dry weight (DW) sediment was found in Jakarta Bay, followed by Wonorejo Coast in Surabaya City (414–590 MP particles/kg DW sediment). The MP has entered the food chain through bivalves and fish. Therefore, the plastic pollution which is related to population density, and inadequacy of SWM, needs urgent solution. ]"

However, so far, the multiple forms of this environmental issue have mainly been analysed in international scientific literature in a narrow traditional manner, frequently based on approaching a relatively low number of ordinary land degradation processes. Consequently, as this complex process has not been sufficiently well explored, this study aims to investigate global land degradation in an interdisciplinary and holistic manner, in terms of the multidimensional nature, causes, spatial footprint, multiple consequences (for the ecological and anthropogenic systems worldwide, but also for the global climate system) and various solutions to mitigate worldwide land multi-degradation. Based on various information investigated in more than 500 reliable scientific papers, the findings of this review paper showed that there currently are 17 land degradation pathways (aridity, biological invasions, coastal erosion , land erosion by water, land erosion by wind, land pollution, land subsidence , landslides, permafrost thawing, salinization , soil acidification , soil biodiversity loss, soil compaction, soil organic carbon loss, soil sealing, vegetation degradation and waterlogging), which are active on various spatial scales across the planet. Five of the seventeen land degradation dimensions were considered major land degradation pathways and explored in detail in this study (aridity, land erosion by water, salinization , soil organic carbon loss and vegetation degradation), considering several relevant criteria outlined in the paper (global spatial footprint, data availability, and impact on agricultural, ecological and climate systems). Essentially, it was found that the five global degradation processes significantly erode the multiple ecosystem functions and services of worldwide land systems, which are crucial for human wellbeing, life support and the Earth systems’ stability. Nonetheless, other land degradation processes can also be considered major land degradative pathways, although a main current impediment in their detailed investigation is the general lack of global data availability. Therefore, the study highlights the complexity and severity of global land degradation, and draws attention to the need for other studies to approach land degradation multidimensionally, which goes beyond the traditional perspectives focused on the conventional processes of water erosion, wind erosion or soil salinization. At the same time, the study highlights the fact that land degradation must be an urgent priority in governmental and international policies, which can rely on a wide range of control measures that are currently available (some of the relevant ones are explored in this paper) for combating this disrupting environmental process rapidly, efficiently and on a large scale throughout the world. ]"

The article is based on a bibliographic database search that identified 201 articles describing sediment impacts on seagrasses. Articles were classified by one of three non-exclusive modes of action: 1) light reduction; 2) smothering (burial), and 3) effects via rhizosphere physico-chemistry. Most citations (104) investigated multi-mode impacts of sediments, but the most frequently investigated single mode was light reduction (57 citations), followed by substrate rhizosphere chemistry (31) then smothering effects (6). Mud with high organic content is particularly problematic and smaller seagrasses are particularly vulnerable. Research gaps include polyphasic approaches, and studies of interactions between smothering, rhizosphere biogeochemistry and light climate.

This resulted in a “marine resource curse” and economic development problems. Several factors drive its spatial and temporal evolution. A regression model was derived for the significant driving factors. Areas severely affected by this marine resource curse have a clear southward trend. , Based on the connotation of a so-called resource curse, this paper uses panel data from 11 coastal provinces in China to explore the spatial and temporal evolution of the marine resource curse in China by calculating its coefficient using the kernel density estimation model and GIS spatial analysis techniques. The generalized method of moments estimation is adopted to quantitatively study the factors driving the marine resource curse in China. The results show the following. 1) From 1996 to 2014, the marine resource curse coefficient in China exhibited a declining trend and the phenomenon abated slightly, gradually narrowing the gap between the coastal provinces. 2) The spatial evolution of the marine resource curse in China clearly shows a southward trend in terms of severely affected areas. The edge area of the marine resource curse curve first showed an increase and then declined. There was little change in the main distribution area not affected by the marine resource curse. Among those coastal areas, the marine resource curse in Hebei, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Guangdong improved with trends in development, while the situation in Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Hainan deteriorated. The situation in Tianjin fluctuated, while that in Shandong, Shanghai, and Fujian did not change significantly. 3) The main driving factors of the marine resource curse in China include the level of material capital investment, the degree of openness to the outside world, the structure of the marine industry, and the capability for scientific and technological innovation. These factors have differing yet significant impacts on the marine resource curse: the level of material capital investment has a significantly positive impact on the marine resource curse in China, while the other driving factors have negative impacts. ]"

In this paper, we review previous studies that explored the relations between sea-level rise and shoreline changes over the last few decades. Existing methods can be classified into two groups: (1) approaches based on the analysis of trends and variability in shoreline change observations, which investigate whether a correlation with the temporal or spatial patterns sea level changes can be established; and (2) approaches based on the comparison of shoreline observations with a coastal model outcome, which attempt to evaluate the contribution of sea-level rise to shoreline mobility using coastal evolution modeling tools. The existing applications of these methods face two common difficulties: first, shoreline data are often lacking or insufficiently resolved temporally to capture the dynamics of coastlines; and second, relative sea level along the coast is generally only known in a limited number of areas where tide gauges are available. These two challenges can be met, owing to the increasing amount of shoreline change observations and complementary geodetic techniques. The wide range of different interpretations regarding the role of sea-level rise in recent shoreline changes highlights the necessity to conduct specific studies that rely on local observations and models applicable in the local geomorphological context. ]"

Seven sea reclamation management measures, China has implemented with the management philosophy of total amount control and intensive use, and their effects are generally introduced. The paper concludes that, with China's economy stepping into the stage of stable growth, sea reclamation demands for industrial construction and town expanding has decreased, while demand for coastal tourism and public space will increase gradually. , Over the last decade, China's annual average reclamation area has been approximately 100 km 2 . Sea reclamation provides a space guarantee for industrialization and urbanization and is a motivating force for China's rapid economic growth. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of sea reclamation has caused problems due to the oversized scale and extensive use of the sea, resulting in the loss of large quantities of coastal shoal wetlands and natural shorelines and leading to continued deterioration of marine ecological environment. China has attached great importance to sea reclamation management. In order to strengthen sea reclamation management and to protect the marine environment, China has developed seven management system measures. These measures include a sea reclamation plan, marine functional zoning, regional sea use planning, a plane design for sea reclamation, a control index of the sea area for projects, sea area use demonstration and environmental impact evaluations, as well as an examination and approval administration with the management philosophy of total amount control and intensive use. At present, China's economic development faces a “new normal”, as industrial and urban demands on sea reclamation will gradually become more reasonable, and the primary application of sea reclamation will transition to coastal tourism, construction of the area close to sea, and recovery and repair of the coastal zone. In the future, China will continue to implement strict sea reclamation management based on ecological system recovery and public participation. In this essay, the system, experience and future development trends of sea reclamation management in China is comprehensively introduced in an effort to provide reference sea reclamation management plans to other countries around the world. ]"

However, only recently has the refinement of dating techniques made possible the use of paleoshorelines as reliable tools for tectonic studies. Although there are many local studies of Quaternary vertical motions of coastlines, we know of no comprehensive worldwide synthesis. Here we provide a compilation of 890 records of paleoshoreline sequences, with particular emphasis on the last interglacial stage (Marine Isotopic Stage [MIS] 5e, ~ 122 ka). The quality of dating MIS 5e makes it a reliable marker to evaluate vertical ground motion rates during the late Quaternary on a global scale. The results show that most coastal segments have risen relative to sea-level with a mean uplift rate higher than 0.2 mm/yr, i.e. more than four times faster than the estimated eustatic drop in sea level. The results also reveal that the uplift rate is faster on average for active margins than for passive margins. Neither dynamic topography nor glacio-hydro-isostasy may explain sustained uplift of all continental margins , as revealed by the wide distribution of uplifted sequences of paleoshorelines. Instead, we suggest that only plate-tectonic processes reconcile all observations of Quaternary coastal uplift. We propose that long-term continental accretion has led to compression of continental plates and uplift of their margins. Therefore this study concludes that plate-tectonics processes impact all margins and emphasizes the fact that the notion of a stable platform is unrealistic. These results therefore seriously challenge the evaluation of past sea levels from the fossil shoreline record. ]"

It is, therefore, important to understand the impact of these settlements on the evolution of clastic coasts. How did ancient societies exploit and adapt to deltaic environments? Here, we detail a typology of ancient harbours on clastic coasts using a suite of multidisciplinary case studies from the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. We present the impact of different forcing agents (floods, storms, sedimentary inputs, relative sea-level (RSL) changes, dredging and harbour structures) on the geomorphological evolution of selected harbour sites, and underline the important role of coastal changes at different temporal and spatial scales. These processes affected the infrastructure and the viability of harbours to varying degrees. In deltaic contexts, our analysis differentiates five harbour types: (1) fluvial harbours, affected by floods, rapid sedimentation and river-channel changes; (2a) infilled estuarine harbours; or (2b) submerged estuarine harbours, lying at the interface between marine and fluvial processes ; (3) lagoonal harbours strongly affected by sedimentary inputs; and (4) the impact of humans on harbour basins via harbour protection structures and dredging . For these harbour types, we probe the advantages and disadvantages of each geomorphological setting, in addition to the consequences of environmental pressures on human societies. ]"

Most of the reviewed literature confirmed that heavy metal concentrations in marine organisms were generally within allowable concentrations and pose no threat to public health. Likewise, studies suggested that levels of heavy metals in marine sediments are similar or lower compared to other regions. However, localized hotspots of chronic metal pollution in areas influenced by industrial facilities, desalination plants, and oil refineries have been reported.

The shorelines are commonly represented by palaeo-coastal cliffs and barrier-beaches that lie today at water depths between − 100 m and − 70 m, and between − 65 m and − 40 m, in most places irrespective of the different tectonic contexts, even in the presence of significant vertical rates. These morphological features are thought to have been drowned during melt-water pulses 1A and 1B, which occurred between 15 and 10 ka. The evidence presented here confirms drowned shorelines documented elsewhere at similar water depths and shows that melt-water pulses have punctuated the post-glacial relative sea-level rise with rates up to 60 mm/yr. for a few centuries. The identification of morphological features related to melt-water pulses in the central Mediterranean Sea has important implications to improve our knowledge on episodes of rapid glacio-eustatic sea-level rise. This issue is critical to be able to forecast future sea-level rises in the Mediterranean, which is characterized by densely populated coasts and important coastal infrastructures. ]"

Coral reef ecosystems are under severe threat from both local and global threats, which are degrading the ecosystem services that they provide to humanity. Past studies have assumed that the loss of ecosystem services will lead to a proportionate impact on people. We argue that this is unlikely to be the case in the short-term due to the high level of adaptability illustrated by communities associated with coral reefs. Eventually, however, stress will reach levels that exhaust the capacity of people and communities to adapt. Data sets and analysis are sparse, however, we call for a greater focus on understanding the flexibility and adaptability of people associated with coral reefs, especially in a time of rapid global change. , Coral reefs are biodiverse and productive ecosystems but are threatened by local and global stresses. The resulting loss of coral reefs is threatening coastal food and livelihoods. Climate projections suggest that coral reefs will continue to undergo major changes even if the goals of the Paris Agreement (Dec 2015) are successfully implemented. Ecological changes include modified food webs, shifts in community structure, reduced habitat complexity, decreased fecundity and recruitment, changes to fisheries productivity/opportunity, and a shift in the carbonate budget of some ecosystems toward dissolution and erosion of calcium carbonate stocks. Broad estimates of the long-term (present value) of services provided by the ocean’s ecological assets exist and are useful in highlighting the value of reefs yet must be contextualised by how people respond under ecosystem change. The dynamic nature of the relationship between people, economies, and the environment complicates estimation of human consequences and economic outcomes of changing environmental and ecological capital. Challenges have increased given lack of baseline data and our inability to predict (with any precision) how people respond to changing coral reef conditions, especially given the variability, flexibility, and creativity shown by human communities and economies under change. Here, we explore how the changes to the three-dimensional structure of coral reefs affect benefits for people, specifically coastal protection, fisheries habitat, and tourism. Based on a review of available data and literature, we make a series of key recommendations that are required to better understanding of how global change will affect people dependent on coral reefs. These include: (1) baseline studies and frameworks for understanding human responses to climate change within complex social and ecological setting such as coral reefs, (2) better tools for exploring environmental benefits, markets, and financial systems faced by change, and (3) the integration of these insights into more effective policy making. ]"

Based on the combination of global sea level change and sequence stratigraphy , we systematically investigated the evolution of sedimentary system in the ECS since the last glacial maximum (LGM). We have defined the transgressive boundary layer and constructed several sedimentary models of the ECS on the sequence stratigraphy and evolution of tidal sand ridges since the LGM, and sediment “source to sink” during the high sea level. The result shows that the ECS represent a typical case for large-scale continental shelf response to the global sea level change . Three sedimentary system tracts had been formed in the ECS since the LGM. First is the lowstand system tract corresponding to the late of last glaciation and LGM (23–15.4 cal. kyr B.P.). The progressive wedge occurred along the Okinawa Trough slope and the paleo-coastal zone (PCZ) along the continental shelf edge. Second is the transgressive system tract corresponding to the last deglaciation (15.4–7 cal. kyr B.P.). A large-scale transgressive boundary layer and tidal sand ridges were formed in this stage. Third is the highstand system tract corresponding to the high sea level since 7 cal. kyr B.P. The eddy mud, coastal current mud, present tidal sand ridge, delta, tidal flat and beach have been accumulating since then. The global sea level change after LGM can be divided into seven phases, of which four rapidly rising phases (RRP, I, II, III, IV) and three slowly rising phases (SRP, I, II, III) are distinguished. The tidal sand ridges were formed in the SRP and transgressive boundary layer in the RRP. The tidal sand ridges can be divided into three types including radicalized, channel and emanative. The modern circulation current system of the ECS had been built in the end of the last deglaciation . The effect of sediment “source to sink” in the ECS is closely correlative to the current system driven by the interaction of the East Asian monsoon and Kuroshio. The major sediment source is from the river discharge of the Huanghe and Changjiang River, and coastal resuspension . The muddy sediment in the eddy and coastal current, which cover the tidal sand ridges and transgressive boundary layer, is a major sediment sink in the modern ECS. ]"

There has been an extensive interest in securing its sustainable exploitation and viability. This study presents the small-scale fishery of the Dodecanese Islands (Kalymnos, Kos, Leros, Patmos, Symi) where the largest small-scale fleet in the eastern Mediterranean is located. The aim is to evaluate the economic viability of small scale fishing fleets, based on calculating economic performance and by using linear regression models. The related métiers were identified by using a multivariate analysis and by inputting the main resources and fishing gear data that were collected during landings. The most important métiers concerning the fishing gear and the target species are: gillnet , Boops boops , trammel net, Scorpaena porcus and Mullus surmuletus , set longline, Pagellus erythrinus, Pagrus pagrus, Diplodus sargus , drifting longlines, Xiphias gladius and handlines, Octopus vulgaris .

The basin, which is tectonically controlled, is filled with lutite facies alternating with channel-filling rudites. This detrital aquifer is affected by seasonal seawater intrusion–extrusion processes due to increasing withdrawal of groundwater for human consumption and irrigation during dry periods. A study was performed to improve the hydrogeological knowledge of this coastal aquifer system. The study examined the morphology of the impervious substratum, the facies distribution and the position of the seawater wedge. For this purpose, an Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) geophysical technique was used and the tomographic data were calibrated using geological observations and borehole studies. An analysis was carried out to compare the direct information obtained from the 35 boreholes with the indirect data corresponding to the four electrical tomography profiles. In the study, over 9660 resistivity data points were processed. The ERT profiles perfectly corroborated the information derived from the boreholes. The profiles made it possible to detect thickness changes, lithological changes and the presence of faults. Moreover, from a hydrogeologic standpoint, this research technique is capable of detecting the position of the phreatic level and, in coastal aquifers such as the one examined in this study, the possible horizontal or vertical penetration of seawater intrusion. Therefore, the electrical geophysical prospecting based on ERT can be highly useful in areas lacking sufficient geological information and/or mechanical borehole data. ]"

The first section of this paper summarizes the concepts associated with vulnerability, natural hazards and climate change. The most widely adopted analytical approaches to vulnerability assessment are described, including spatial scales , the need for hybrid approaches comprising both biophysical and social dimensions of vulnerability, and the gradual incorporation of resilience aspects into such methodologies. In particular, the development and application of vulnerability indices is examined, based on a review of more than 50 studies that applied such indices across a range of hazards. The analytical procedures, proposed typologies, and most commonly selected variables are discussed. This overview demonstrates the breadth of vulnerability studies. This leads inevitably to lack of standardization of concepts and assumptions, which results in limited comparability between outputs for coasts from different areas. However, the widespread demand for vulnerability assessment as a component of decision-making in integrated management of the coast justifies pursuing indicator-based vulnerability assessments. In some cases these will explicitly adopt a consistent methodology that enables comparison between sites, whereas alternatively, metrics may be developed that are designed around particular system components and the site-specific functions for which they are valued. ]"

RADIALES contribution to international databases helps to get a more coherent understanding of ocean ecosystems. RADIALES exemplifies the value of basic research for a correct management of environmental resources. , Ship-based time-series observations provide crucial data for understanding marine ecosystems , improving decision making in ocean and coastal management. However, only a few time series survive for more than a decade. RADIALES is one of the longest multidisciplinary programs in operation in the northern and northwestern coast of Spain. In the last 30 years, this program collected monthly data on physical, chemical and plankton observations in an array of five sections of stations representative of upwelling and stratified dynamics. Here, the main achievements, including key contributions to ecosystem conservation policies, are summarized. The development of this program, in line with similar initiatives in other countries, included phases focused on the study of seasonality , on comparative analysis, and lately on the analysis of decadal variability and regime shifts. Furthermore, in recent years there was a substantial improvement in the identification of plankton species by genomics. Among the main findings of RADIALES are the quantification of ocean warming at subsurface layers, the determination of climatologies in thermohaline, biogeochemical and biological variables, the inventory of plankton species (from bacteria to zooplankton) and the identification of regionally coherent regime shifts. Baselines defined by RADIALES series were instrumental for the assessment of environmental impacts (e.g. oil spills) and for the support of environmental policies (e.g. Marine Strategy Framework Directive). By contributing to international databases, data from programs as RADIALES combined with new instrumental observations will help to develop a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the ocean ecosystems, enhancing our ability to detect and forecast risks. ]"

Additionally, current profiles, drifter data, and hydrographic data completed the data set. The subtropical gyre of the South Atlantic is governed by a Sverdrup balance between the curl of the wind stress and the planetary vorticity. The coastal and shelf edge upwelling of cold nutrient enriched water in the Benguela are driven by the south east trade and the negative curl of the wind stress concentrated at the shelf edge of the Benguela, respectively. The coastal upwelling is maintained by wind fluctuations in the coastal wave guide with time scales of less than 10 days since coastal upwelling is stopped and the associated jets are arrested by coastal Kelvin waves. The shelf edge upwelling is maintained by wind stress curl fluctuations with time scales less than a few months since it is controlled by propagating long baroclinic Rossby waves. The compensation current of the Ekman offshore current ventilates the bottom water on the shelf of the Benguela more efficient in austral winter than in summer with well oxygenated Eastern South Atlantic Central Water which is advected by the Benguela current along the shelf edge. Wind stress curl localised just north of the Angola–Benguela front forces the Angola Dome which disperses into the Angola Gyre by long baroclinic Rossby waves. The eastern part of the Angola Gyre, as part of the southern Subtropical Cell in the South Atlantic, is governed by Sverdup balance while its western part is modified by heat accumulated by upwelled water along its path within the South Equatorial Current. The corresponding sea level elevation terminates the gyre at about 20°W and forms a ridge at whose southern edge the South Equatorial Counter Current develops. The upwelling in the Angola Gyre lifts its thermocline water into the euphotic zone causing high biologic productivity. The degradation of sinking plankton implies a suboxic thermocline water mass in the centre of the gyre with high nutrient concentration. Interaction between the subtropical gyre and the Subtropical Cell in the South Atlantic occurs on the West African shelf by poleward outbreaks of the Angola Current through the Angola–Benguela front carrying suboxic South Atlantic Central Water with high nutrient concentration into the northern Benguela. These outbreaks maintain the nutrient balance of the northern Benguela and are controlled by variations of the meridional wind stress in the Cape Frio cell and by elevated coastal sea level north of the Angola–Benguela front. Coastal sea level is elevated in September to November by an equatorial Kelvin wave which is triggered by relaxation of zonal wind stress in the equatorial wave belt of the western Atlantic and in February to April by freshwater surplus due to precipitation in the eastern tropical Atlantic and river discharge at the African coast. The coincidence of outbreaks of the Angola current onto the shelf of the northern Benguela with weakened ventilation of the bottom water in austral summer support the formation of anoxic bottom water due to diffusion of hydrogen sulphide from the mud belt into the water column during austral summer. ]"

Bangladesh and the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD) have been highlighted as a region at risk from sea-level rise, but reliable estimates of land subsidence have been limited. While early studies suggested high rates of relative sea-level rise, recent papers estimate more modest rates. Our objective is to better quantify the magnitude, spatial variability, and depth variation of sediment compaction and land subsidence in the lower GBD to better evaluate the processes controlling them and the pattern of relative sea level rise in this vulnerable region. We combine subsidence and compaction estimates from hand-drilled tube wells and historic sites (1–5 mm/y), GNSS and river gauges (4–8 mm/y) and RSET-MH and borehole vertical strainmeters (9–10 mm/y) in SW Bangladesh. The differences between the different types of measurements reflect the different timescales, spatial distribution and depth sensitivity of the different observations. Rates are lower for times &gt;300y providing data on the timescale of compaction. We also observe differences related to the degree to which different devices measure shallow and deep subsidence. Higher values reflect a greater component of subsidence from young shallow deposits from soil compaction and organic matter degradation. Thus, we observe different rates for different environments and physical settings. These differences indicate that in planning adaptation for rising sea level , hard construction with a solid foundation may experience different subsidence rates than open fields or reclaimed land with recent natural or anthropogenic sedimentation. Significance statement Land subsidence increases the impact of sea level rise. We combine six different types of measurements that examine land subsidence in coastal Bangladesh. The results show that causes of subsidence, including compaction of the sediments varies both spatially and with depth, and that compaction and organic matter degradation from young shallow deposits is a significant contribution to subsidence. This suggests that hard construction with a solid foundation, such as buildings and embankments , may experience a lower subsidence rates than open fields or reclaimed land with recent natural or anthropogenic sedimentation. ]"

However, the architecture and evolution of its retroarc-arc-forearc system, which is important for us to understand the interaction or connection between continental and oceanic lithospheres , are ambiguous. Using multiple disciplinary data comprising seismic profiles, field observations and numerical paleo-topographies, this study synthetically focused on the Jurassic-Cretaceous evolution and geodynamics of the Andean-type Southeast China continental margin. Subduction of the paleo-Pacific Plate was initiated during the Early Jurassic (~200 Ma), generating a NNE-striking Jurassic magmatic arc along the East China Sea, bounded by imbricate thrust faults on both sides and coinciding with a paleo-topographic coastal mountain range. While the Jurassic arc erupted along an ENE-striking Triassic suture zone in the northern South China Sea, dominated by the Tethyan tectonic domain and overprinted by the Pacific tectonic domain. The Jurassic coastal mountain range began to collapse and transited into a rift basin at ~135 Ma and then the Andean-type continental margin gradually switched to the western Pacific-type during the Late Cretaceous (100–72 Ma), accompanied by Jurassic thrust faults inverting into Cretaceous detachment faults and magmatic arc migrated eastward to the Taiwan-Rukyu areas. Such eastward tectonic migration and transition is associated with the eastward retreat of the subducted paleo-Pacific slab. Then a regional latest Cretaceous (72–66 Ma) compression prevailed Southeast China, probably related to “ridge subduction” when the Pacific Plate replaced the paleo-Pacific Plate to subduct beneath East Asia. ]"

Five major physical processes control mud depocenter development. A dichotomy exists between episodic and long-term sedimentation. Episodic events likely influence mud depocenters in a range of oceanographic settings. Improvements of mud sedimentation parametrizations are necessary. , Mud depocenters (MDCs) represent major proximal-marine sinks for fine-grained terrigenous material, carbon, and contaminants on modern continental shelves . Throughout the past decades, several studies have shed light on the physical processes controlling MDC development at various timescales, ranging from controlled flume experiments and in-situ oceanographic monitoring, to stratigraphic analyses of recent and ancient deposits based on seismo-acoustic and sediment-core data. Thereby, key mechanisms related to the formation and maintenance dynamics of MDCs have been discovered: a) cross-shore bottom transport of suspended mud through gravity flows , b) interaction of mud with density gradients associated with oceanic fronts , c) resuspension and dispersal control of mud by internal waves , d) bedload deposition of mud forming laminated bedding under energetic flow conditions, and e) mud resuspension resulting from chronic bottom trawling . Among the physical processes identified or proposed, three conceptual paradigms for MDC development can be distinguished: 1. continuous supply , associated with a steady sediment supply and hemipelagic settling in relatively calm conditions; 2. continual resuspension-deposition cycles , wherein parts of an MDC area are subject to multiple cycles of resuspension, redeposition and reworking before ultimate burial; and 3. episodic sedimentation and erosion , in which extreme events such as riverine floods and atmospheric storms dominate the total, long-term sediment flux. Although the predominance of each of these paradigms within a single MDC depends to a large degree on the timescales considered, case studies tend to emphasize processes associated with only one of these three paradigms. As a result, the relative, long-term contribution of individual processes remains largely uncertain for many MDCs. The ability of numerical models to accurately predict medium to long-term mud accumulation is restricted not only by computational costs, but also by insufficient parametrizations of the muddy sedimentation process. These remain challenging to constrain due to the multiplicity and complexity of factors affecting the cohesive properties of mud, including its state of consolidation, and the amount and type of organic matter present. Bridging the gap between individual events and long-term accumulation is the key to a more complete understanding of sedimentation processes in MDCs. ]"

The warming/cooling periods follow the low/high NAO periods and the high/low AMO periods with a delay of 4–5 years. It takes about two years for a strong and broad-scale salinity anomaly (such as the GSA) to spread across the region. The warming/cooling events spread across the region in a year or less and propagate about twice faster the salinity anomalies. The difference between the propagation of salinity and temperature anomalies is because salinity is more subject to horizontal advection . , The focus of this work is on the temporal and spatial variability of the Atlantic Water (AW). We analyze the existing historic hydrographic data from the World Ocean Database to document the long-term variability of the AW throughflow across the Norwegian Sea to the western Barents Sea. Interannual-to-multidecadal variability of water temperature, salinity and density are analyzed along six composite sections crossing the AW flow and coastal currents at six selected locations. The stations are lined up from southwest to northeast – from the northern North Sea (69°N) throughout the Norwegian Sea to the Kola Section in the Barents Sea (33°30′E). The changing volume and characteristics of the AW throughflow dominate the hydrographic variability on decadal and longer time scales in the studied area. We examine the role of fluctuations of the volume of inflow versus the variable local factors, such as the air–sea interaction and mixing with the fresh coastal and cold Arctic waters, in controlling the long-term regional variability. It is shown that the volume of the AW, passing through the area and affecting the position of the outer edge of the warm and saline core, correlates well with temperature and salinity averaged over the central portions of the studied sections. The coastal flow (mostly associated with the Norwegian Coastal Current flowing over the continental shelf) is largely controlled by seasonal local heat and freshwater impacts. Temperature records at all six lines show a warming trend superimposed on a series of relatively warm and cold periods, which in most cases follow, with a delay of four to five years, the periods of relatively low and high North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the periods of relatively high and low Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), respectively. In general, there is a relatively high correlation between the year-to-year changes of the NAO and AMO indices, which is to some extent reflected in the (delayed) AW temperature fluctuations. It takes about two years for freshening and salinification events and a much shorter time (of about a year or less) for cooling and warming episodes to propagate or spread across the region. This significant difference in the propagation rates of salinity and temperature anomalies is explained by the leading role of horizontal advection in the propagation of salinity anomalies, whereas temperature is also controlled by the competing air–sea interaction along the AW throughflow. Therefore, although a water parcel moves within the flow as a whole, the temperature, salinity and density anomalies split and propagate separately, with the temperature and density signals leading relative to the salinity signal. A new hydrographic index, coastal-to-offshore density step, is introduced to capture variability in the strength of the AW volume transport. This index shows the same cycles of variability as observed in temperature, NAO and AMO but without an obvious trend. ]"

The central aim of the paper is to offer a broad overview on the main deposits and key localities that have been documented along the Atlantic coastlines, and which attest to the local or regional impact of tsunamis during historical, pre-historical and recent geological times . Considerable detail is devoted to summarising key diagnostic criteria used to identify the deposits as tsunami-derived, and to set each deposit in its own unique geomorphological setting and context, always referring to the latest scientific knowledge of the events that generated them. The paper also discusses the relationships between the different tsunamigenic sources that concurred to the formation of the deposits, as well as critical information on magnitude and frequency, as inferred from the sedimentary responses preserved in the sediment archives. Documented case studies range from the well-studied landslide-triggered and earthquake-triggered Storegga and 1755 Lisbon tsunamis, respectively, to collapse- and eruption-triggered tsunamis in the Atlantic archipelagos , to other less well-known events in the south Atlantic, Caribbean and Arctic. Despite its less frequent tsunami recurrence, the Atlantic coastal stratigraphy presents some world-class case studies and outstanding outcrops, from which critical knowledge can be gained with respect to some of the most enigmatic aspects of tsunami science. ]"

Data on diclofenac occurrence in marine sediments and marine organisms are scarce. Diclofenac is responsible for a wide variety of effects in marine organisms. , Interest in the presence and effects of diclofenac (DCF) and other pharmaceutical products (PPs) in the aquatic environment has been growing over the last 20 years. DCF has been included in the First Watch List of the EU Water Framework Directive in order to gather monitoring data in surface waters. Despite PP input in water bodies, few studies have been conducted to determine the extent of DCF occurrence and effects on marine ecosystems , which is usually the final recipient of surface waters. The present article reviews available published data on DCF occurrence in marine water, sediment and organisms, and its effects on marine organisms. The findings highlight the scarcity of available data on the occurrence and effects of DCF in marine ecosystems, and the need for further data acquisition to assess the risks associated with the presence of this compound in the environment. ]"

These processes involve interactions between the inner and the outer shoreface, the scale of which is much larger than that of interactions between the beachface and the inner shoreface. The main question embedded in these scale differences is how cross-shore and longshore sediment transport processes intervene in the long-term evolution of wave-dominated shores. The problem may be considered in terms of a hierarchy of stepped processes within an overall framework of sediment mass continuity within the shoreface–beach system, more or less modulated by the numerous environmental parameters that may affect barrier development. The chapter focuses on the process interactions and the way they organize sandy beaches and barriers and their development. The first section of the chapter describes surf zone and beachface processes, and the second section focuses on processes affecting the upper beach and backshore zones, notably aeolian, storm erosion, and overwash. The third section is an integration of larger-scale, longer-term barrier development processes that includes the shoreface dimension. The last section explains the palaeoenvironmental characterization of beaches and barriers from a process point of view. ]"

While many studies have already explored benthic impacts at small temporal and spatial scales, little is known on how the small-scale effects accumulate and interactively guide large-scale (km-scale) morphological evolution. Here we firstly summarize the most important processes of benthos affecting sediment stability and then explore existing biomorphodynamic modeling studies both at small- and large-scales. In general, microbenthos (body size &lt;0.1 mm) mainly stabilizes sediments while meio- (0.1–1 mm) and macrobenthos (&gt;1 mm) may stabilize or destabilize sediments. Among all types of sediment, fine-grained fraction (silt and clay) is most sensitive to the impact of benthos . Benthic organisms have the capability to mediate sediment transport and sedimentation patterns beyond their habitats on the long-term and over a large-scale. However, so far, numerical models evaluating benthic impact are limited to explorative studies and have not reached a stage where they can be used for predictive modeling. The barriers hindering a further development of biomorphodynamic models include not only limited understanding of fundamental biological/bio-physical processes affecting morphological development and dynamic feedback loops among them but also a shortage of data for model calibration and confirmation of simulation results. On the other hand, thriving for higher model complexity does not necessarily lead to better performance. Before conducting biomorphodynamic modeling, researchers must figure out which questions can be answered in a meaningful sense with simulation results that can be compared with observations and which level of modeling complexity is sufficient for that purpose. ]"

The morphodynamic beach state continuum was originally established in the 1970s but at the time, only hydrodynamic processes and morphologies in these various states were described. Since the early 1980s when sensors capable of resolving suspended sediment concentration at intra-wave time scale became available, many studies have examined suspended sediment transport by waves and currents on the shoreface. The synthesis of this work shows that the two end states in the morphodynamic continuum, which are the dissipative and reflective states, exhibit relatively small rates of cross-shore sediment transport and weak gradients in that transport which both ensure that the nearshore morphology is relatively stable. The intervening intermediate beach states typically exhibit prominent bar topographies and in these states, strong morphodynamic feedbacks between hydrodynamic processes and morphology create locally large transport rates and sharp transport gradients which is the reason for the dynamic nature of these beach states. Transport processes driving sediment onshore and offshore within beach states are discussed as well as the transport processes responsible for state transitions. ]"

This review identifies factors influencing our ability to retain or restore natural features or construct artificial habitats on beaches and dunes in the presence of these structures. Protection structures are visual and physical intrusions into natural landscapes, and they alter natural processes and introduce exotic habitat. Impacts on landforms and habitats vary depending on the type of structure and its size, shape, orientation, type of materials used, age and state of repair. Changes will occur to any structure through time, and decisions must be made to supplement, rebuild, replace, or remove them or allow them to deteriorate. Decisions about removing protection structures are problematic because they might already have habitat value, and the effects of removal are as difficult to predict as the effects of their original emplacement . Creative alternatives to traditional structures can be applied to retain or enhance some of the natural values of landforms and habitats. This can occur by making structures smaller, placing them below ground or water level, selecting construction materials that enhance habitat, or using beach fill to overcome undesirable effects. Decisions are required on whether the enhancement of habitat by modifying traditional structures is actually desirable. Humans must now be considered intrinsic agents of landscape evolution , and decisions on how, when and where to place, modify or remove protection structures depend on numerous human inputs, requiring interventions that have an interdisciplinary perspective and are placed in a societal context. ]"

Interactions between estuary type and anthropogenic impact amplify greenhouse gases. Urban pressures may make estuaries a hidden source of greenhouse gases globally. A conceptual model for estuarine greenhouse gas generation is presented. , Biologically productive regions such as estuaries and coastal areas, even though they only cover a small percentage of the world's oceans, contribute significantly to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. This paper synthesises greenhouse gas data measured in UK estuary studies, highlighting that urban wastewater loading is significantly correlated with both methane ( P &lt; 0.001) and nitrous oxide ( P &lt; 0.005) concentrations. It demonstrates that specific estuary typologies render them more sensitive to anthropogenic influences on greenhouse gas production, particularly estuaries that experience low oxygen levels due to reduced mixing and stratification or high sediment oxygen demand. Significantly, we find that estuaries with high urban wastewater loading may be hidden sources of greenhouse gases globally. Synthesising available information, a conceptual model for greenhouse gas concentrations in estuaries with different morphologies and mixing regimes is presented. Applications of this model should help identification of estuaries susceptible to anthropogenic impacts and potential hotspots for greenhouse gas emissions . ]"

The currents in the northern IO reverse seasonally and have large biological impacts. The Leeuwin Current flows poleward and sheds seaward-propagating eddies. The Agulhas Current is very large and generates eddies that propagate alongshore. Leeuwin and Agulhas Current eddies also have large biological impacts. , Monsoon forcing and the unique geomorphology of the Indian Ocean basin result in complex boundary currents, which are unique in many respects. In the northern Indian Ocean, several boundary current systems reverse seasonally. For example, upwelling coincident with northward-flowing currents along the coast of Oman during the Southwest Monsoon gives rise to high productivity which also alters nutrient stoichiometry and therefore, the species composition of the resulting phytoplankton blooms. During the Northeast Monsoon most of the northern Indian Ocean boundary currents reverse and favor downwelling. Higher trophic level species have evolved behavioral responses to these seasonally changing conditions. Examples from the western Arabian Sea include vertical feeding migrations of a copepod ( Calanoides carinatus ) and the reproductive cycle of a large pelagic fish ( Scomberomorus commerson ). The impacts of these seasonal current reversals and changes in upwelling and downwelling circulations are also manifested in West Indian coastal waters, where they influence dissolved oxygen concentrations and have been implicated in massive fish kills. The winds and boundary currents reverse seasonally in the Bay of Bengal, though the associated changes in upwelling and productivity are less pronounced. Nonetheless, their effects are observed on the East Indian shelf as, for example, seasonal changes in copepod abundance and zooplankton community structure. In contrast, south of Sri Lanka seasonal reversals in the boundary currents are associated with dramatic changes in the intensity of coastal upwelling, chlorophyll concentration, and catch per unit effort of fishes. Off the coast of Java, monsoon-driven changes in the currents and upwelling strongly impact chlorophyll concentrations, seasonal vertical migrations of zooplankton, and sardine catch in Bali Strait. In the southern hemisphere the Leeuwin is a downwelling-favorable current that flows southward along western Australia, though local wind forcing can lead to transient near shore current reversals and localized coastal upwelling. The poleward direction of this eastern boundary current is unique. Due to its high kinetic energy the Leeuwin Current sheds anomalous, relatively high chlorophyll, warm-core, downwelling eddies that transport coastal diatom communities westward into open ocean waters. Variations in the Leeuwin transport and eddy generation impact many higher trophic level species including the recruitment and fate of rock lobster ( Panulirus cygnus) larvae. In contrast, the transport of the Agulhas Current is very large, with sources derived from the Mozambique Channel, the East Madagascar Current and the southwest Indian Ocean sub-gyre. Dynamically, the Agulhas Current is upwelling favorable; however, the spatial distribution of prominent surface manifestations of upwelling is controlled by local wind and topographic forcing. Meanders and eddies in the Agulhas Current propagate alongshore and interact with seasonal changes in the winds and topographic features. These give rise to seasonally variable localized upwelling and downwelling circulations with commensurate changes in primary production and higher trophic level responses. Due to the strong influence of the Agulhas Current, many neritic fish species in southeast Africa coastal waters have evolved highly selective behaviors and reproductive patterns for successful retention of planktonic eggs and larvae. For example, part of the Southern African sardine ( Sardinops sagax ) stock undergoes a remarkable northward migration enhanced by transient cyclonic eddies in the shoreward boundary of the Agulhas Current. There is evidence from the paleoceanographic record that these currents and their biogeochemical and ecological impacts have changed significantly over glacial to interglacial timescales. These changes are explored as a means of providing insight into the potential impacts of climate change in the Indian Ocean. ]"

Understanding value chains, identifying pressure points and room for improvement using new technological solutions, are important steps to enhance raw material utilization for the individual industries. Marine resources generated from the fish industry is an important part of the Norwegian food production and contributes about 4% to mainland gross domestic product. The most important industries are Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) aquaculture , and wild capture of pelagic fish , cod ( Gadus morhua) and saithe ( Pollachius virens) . Processing to saleable products, mainly fillets, generates large amounts of marine rest raw material. Logistics of aquaculture production and processing allow for close to 100% utilization, while only 44% of the white fish rest raw material is being utilized. Farming of fish close to shore enable processing of rest raw material immediately after slaughter, which is paramount to avoid deterioration. Cod and Saithe are mainly caught at sea by sea trawlers and the coastal fleet, with on-board handling and transportation to shore being hurdles to overcome for processing of rest raw material to high quality products for human consumption and animal feed. This review will focus on the value chain of the white fish industry in Norway, its history, current status and possibilities of improvement to better utilize rest raw material. ]"

Climate change is expected to intensify ongoing eutrophication of coastal ecosystems. Declining salinities will have negative impacts on foundation species such as Fucus . Results from ocean acidification experiments are mixed, and merit more research effort. , Estuarine macroalgae are important primary producers in aquatic ecosystems , and often foundation species providing structurally complex habitat. Climate change alters many abiotic factors that affect their long-term persistence and distribution. Here, we review the existing scientific literature on the tolerance of key macroalgal species in the Baltic Sea, the world's largest brackish water body. Elevated temperature is expected to intensify coastal eutrophication , further promoting growth of opportunistic, filamentous species, especially green algae , which are often species associated with intensive filamentous algal blooms. Declining salinities will push the distributions of marine species towards south, which may alter the Baltic Sea community compositions towards a more limnic state. Together with increasing eutrophication trends this may cause losses in marine-originating foundation species such as Fucus , causing severe biodiversity impacts. Experimental results on ocean acidification effects on macroalgae are mixed, with only few studies conducted in the Baltic Sea. We conclude that climate change can alter the structure and functioning of macroalgal ecosystems especially in the northern Baltic coastal areas, and can potentially act synergistically with eutrophication. We briefly discuss potential adaptation measures. ]"

Commonly, the Late Mesozoic orogenic processes were characterized by continent–continent collision, large-scale thrusting, strike-slip faulting and intense crustal shortening, crustal thickening, regional anatexis and metamorphism , followed by large-scale lithospheric extension, rifting and magmatism . To better understand the geological processes , this paper reviews and synthesizes existing multi-disciplinary geologic data related to sedimentation, tectonics, magmatism , metamorphism and geochemistry , and proposes a two-stage tectono-thermal evolutionary history of East Asia during the late Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (ca. 170–120 Ma). In the first stage, three orogenic belts along the continental margins were formed coevally at ca. 170–135 Ma, i.e., the north Mongol–Okhotsk orogen, the east paleo-Pacific coastal orogen, and the west Bangong–Nujiang orogen. Tectonism related to the coastal orogen caused extensive intracontinental folding and thrusting that resulted in a depositional hiatus in the Late Jurassic , as well as crustal anatexis that generated syn-kinematic granites , adakites and migmatites. The lithosphere of the East Asian continent was thickened, reaching a maximum during the latest Jurassic or the earliest Cretaceous. In the second stage (ca. 135–120 Ma), delamination of the thickened lithosphere resulted in a remarkable (&gt;120 km) lithospheric thinning and the development of mantle-derived magmatism, mineralization , metamorphic core complexes and rift basins. The Middle Jurassic–Early Cretaceous subduction of oceanic plates (paleo-Pacific, meso-Tethys, and Mongol–Okhotsk) and continent–continent collision (e.g. Lhasa and Qiangtang) along the East Asian continental margins produced broad coastal and intracontinental orogens. These significant tectonic activities, marked by widespread intracontinental orogeny and continental reconstruction, are commonly termed the Yanshan Revolution (Movement) in the Chinese literature. ]"

We highlight the high inter-annual variability of mass variations of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), especially the recent deceleration of ice loss in 2009–2010, once seasonal cycles are robustly removed by Seasonal Trend Loess (STL) decomposition. Interannual variability leads to varying trend estimates depending on the considered time span. Correction of post-glacial rebound effects on ice mass trend estimates represents no more than 8 Gt/y over the whole ice sheet. We also investigate possible climatic causes that can explain these ice mass interannual variations, as strong correlations between GRACE-based mass balance and atmosphere/ocean parallels are established: (1) changes in snow accumulation, and (2) the influence of inputs of warm ocean water that periodically accelerate the calving of glaciers in coastal regions and, feed-back effects of coastal water cooling by fresh currents from glaciers melting. These results suggest that the Greenland mass balance is driven by coastal sea surface temperature at time scales shorter than accumulation. ]"

Stratigraphic ranges of palynomorphs suggest an age of Selandian to Aquitanian. The palynological composition is marked by abundance of dinoflagellate cysts in the Imo Formation (Selandian to Thanetian), dominance of spores and pollen over dinoflagellate cysts in the Nanka Formation (Ypresian to Bartonian), and overwhelming amounts of spore and pollen in the Ogwashi Formation (Pariabonian to Aquitanian). Palynofacies content shows dominance of structureless organic matter in the Imo Formation, few phytoclasts in the Nanka Formation and maximum phytoclast amounts in the Ogwashi Formation. Thanetian to Ypresian boundary was marked by the mixing of older Palaeocene and younger Eocene microfossils , decrease of microflora towards the end of Palaeocene and the evolution of abundant and more diverse Eocene taxa. The Imo Formation was deposited in middle to outer neritic zone based on abundance of gonyaulacacean cysts. However, peridiniacean and terrestrial microflora extend the deposition range to shallow waters of inner neritic and coastal zone. Increase in diversity and abundance of terrestrial palynomorphs over marine palynomorphs assemblages in the overlying Nanka Formation suggest deposition under alternating coastal and inner neritic conditions while the Ogwashi Formation records oscillating coastal plain and brackish water depositional conditions.

However, under certain equilibrium conditions of fresh and salt water in parts of some carbonate aquifers unusual hydrologic phenomena result. Hydrologic conditions at Tarpon Springs, Florida, and Cephalonia, Greece, include deep vertical openings as sinkholes through a relatively impervious part of the aquifer system. In both cases the tops of the sinkholes or natural wells are exposed to sea water. At Tarpon Springs the dynamic equilibrium between salt water and fresh water fluctuates so that the flow of salt water from the spring to a lake 2 miles away is sometimes reversed. At Cephalonia, the head of fresh water does not exceed the head of salty water in the sinkholes; the flow of sea water into the aquifer, aided by a shallow channel from the sea, is continuous, and the water level in the sinkhole is continuously depressed below sea level. Both cases represent a partially confined U-tube system where water at the seaward, sinkhole end is denser than at the other end and where a low fresh-water head is less than the salt-water head. ]"

Analysing these data, the monthly mean values of τ (0.50 μm) and α and the relative frequency histograms of the daily mean values of both parameters were determined for winter–spring and summer–autumn in the Arctic and for austral summer in Antarctica . The Arctic and Antarctic covariance plots of the seasonal median values of α versus τ (0.50 μm) showed: (i) a considerable increase in τ (0.50 μm) for the Arctic aerosol from summer to winter–spring, without marked changes in α ; and (ii) a marked increase in τ (0.50 μm) passing from the Antarctic Plateau to coastal sites, whereas α decreased considerably due to the larger fraction of sea-salt aerosol. Good agreement was found when comparing ground-based sun-photometer measurements of τ ( λ ) and α at Arctic and Antarctic coastal sites with Microtops measurements conducted during numerous AERONET/MAN cruises from 2006 to 2013 in three Arctic Ocean sectors and in coastal and off-shore regions of the Southern Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and the Antarctic Peninsula . Lidar measurements were also examined to characterise vertical profiles of the aerosol backscattering coefficient measured throughout the year at Ny-Ålesund. Satellite-based MODIS , MISR , and AATSR retrievals of τ ( λ ) over large parts of the oceanic polar regions during spring and summer were in close agreement with ship-borne and coastal ground-based sun-photometer measurements. An overview of the chemical composition of mode particles is also presented, based on in-situ measurements at Arctic and Antarctic sites. Fourteen log-normal aerosol number size-distributions were defined to represent the average features of nuclei, accumulation and coarse mode particles for Arctic haze, summer background aerosol, Asian dust and boreal forest fire smoke, and for various background austral summer aerosol types at coastal and high-altitude Antarctic sites. The main columnar aerosol optical characteristics were determined for all 14 particle modes, based on in-situ measurements of the scattering and absorption coefficients. Diurnally averaged direct aerosol-induced radiative forcing and efficiency were calculated for a set of multimodal aerosol extinction models, using various Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function models over vegetation-covered, oceanic and snow-covered surfaces.

In New Guinea it occurs on the coast and inland in most rivers in the south of the country, with the largest populations in the Fly River. Throughout its range it supports extensive commercial, aquacultural, and recreational fisheries, and in Papua New Guinea it is the most economically important species in the artisanal fisheries of Western Province. Recent genetic research shows that, unlike the situation in northern Australia where there are multiple small genetic stocks of Barramundi, there is just one large stock of Barramundi living in the Fly River and associated coastal waters. This stock extends into Irian Jaya (West Papua), thereby constituting a cross-border resource, but differs from a small isolated stock of Barramundi found in the far east of Papua New Guinea. It has a complex life history and is a protandrous hermaphrodite (starts life as a male and changes to female). A complete reorganization of gonad structure and function takes place after sex inversion, probably under the influence of hormones. L. calcarifer spawn as males for 3–4 years before sex inversion. The fecundity of L. calcarifer is among the highest of any teleost fish, with estimates of from 0.6 to 2.3×10 6 eggs kg −1 of body weight. Large female Barramundi move to the coastal spawning grounds near Sigabaduru (west of Daru) during the late dry season (September–October) when gonad maturation takes place in estuarine waters (salinities of 28–36‰). Spawning takes place in the sea, and between October and February, as the wet season progresses, there is a tidal-based monthly cycle of spawning, with larvae moving into shallow coastal areas and backswamps shortly after hatching at around 5.0-mm long, usually on the spring high tides. Spawning at this time ensures that the juveniles can enter sheltered coastal areas, flooded backswamps, or floodplains and remain in these areas until they dry up during the early part of the dry season. They rapidly become the dominant predators of other fish larvae and crustaceans in this habitat. Juvenile Barramundi leave these habitats and disperse eastward (and westward) along the coast at about 6 months of age and at a length of about 200 mm. Some stay in coastal waters while the majority migrate into the lower Fly River and continue to move upstream , reaching the middle Fly River, the Strickland River, and Lake Murray where they grow to become adults. These adults do not, however, follow a regular annual migration to the sea as they do in Australia, and many fish only visit the sea once during their lives, with some individuals remaining upriver for extended periods. During flood periods many Barramundi move into off-river water bodies, particularly oxbow lakes , where there is an abundance of crustaceans and small fish, such as Fly River Herring ( Nematalosa spp.), that form the bulk of their diet. Barramundi have long been subjected to heavy fishing pressure, both artisanal and commercial, in the Fly River and along the coast of Western Province.

Mitchell cruise of 1992 presents the best spatial coverage in Gulf, for TPH and TOC Ports and oil facilities have chronic pollution that was not masked by Gulf War signals By year 2000 most of the 1991 Gulf War hydrocarbon pollution was not evident A very low level of biogenic aliphatic presence in the marine sediments, suggests the aliphatic production and consumption was fairly steady over the years. , This review presents the spatio-temporal distribution of petroleum hydrocarbons including total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), total organic carbon (TOC), total aliphatics, unresolved complex mixture (UCM), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and total aromatic hydrocarbons in marine sediments of the Gulf (Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman). The TPH ranged between 0.134 and 48,018 μg g −1 dw where 10–15 μg g −1 dw was considered as a background concentration. The TOC levels were between 0.04 and 14.96% with a mean concentration of 1.154 ± 0.523%. Total aliphatic hydrocarbon levels were reported between 0.1 and 76 μg g −1 , the 2005 levels that had the largest spatial coverage were between 0.1 and 4.4 μg g −1 . The unresolved complex mixture was very variable post Gulf War but by 2005 most of the Gulf War artifacts had decreased and the levels were between 1.5 and 73.5 μg g −1 . The ƩPAHs in bottom sediments by 2005 were between 0.3 and 3450 ng g −1 . The total aromatics were limited in spatial extent and varied between 1.0 and 14,000 μg g −1 . Most of the locations with elevated contamination levels were near point sources, e.g. oil facilities and ports, and these sites could be categorized as chronically contaminated by oil. This review highlights the paucity of the data both in terms of the spatial extent and temporal coverage, and with several Gulf states undergoing large-scale coastal developments and offshore oil exploration, it will be prudent to undertake regular monitoring of the petroleum hydrocarbons to ensure effective ecosystem functioning as well as seafood and drinking water safety in the Gulf region. The spatial distribution also highlights the lack of uniformity in assessments and the need to support marine pollution assessments in the Gulf countries. ]"

Seasonal shift in the pre and post spawning between intertidal and subtidal area. Ecosystemic approach to understand spawning process. New indexes used considering spherical nature of the sea urchin. , The sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus is an important exploited resource on the Mediterranean coast and has been the subject of much research. In the Bay of Biscay, the situation is different, as some studies have been conducted on the Spanish Basque coast but few on the French part of that coast. However, the Basque coast offers favourable conditions for the development of this species, and its exploitation could be a source of potential diversification for fishermen, especially in the context of difficulties with some other resources. At the request of the managers of this coastal resource, a study was undertaken on sea urchins to improve knowledge of this stock, particularly about its biological characteristics . In this work, assessment consisted of determining the spawning process of the stock throughout the year by collecting data on sea urchin size and wet weights of the test, dry gonads and viscera . From September 2013 to September 2014, sea urchins were collected monthly at this site, from intertidal and subtidal areas, and then analysed in the laboratory. This study takes into account the tidal level in the sample design, which allows a novel highlighting of significant differences in biological characteristics between intertidal and subtidal individuals. Spawning occurs mainly during May and June, which is important knowledge for defining relevant management measures for fisheries. ]"

Fault-bounded highs across the wedge partition clastic deposition between sub-basins, producing wide variations in sediment thickness over 10’s of kilometres. Partitioning, exacerbated by localised mass-wasting, produces forearc successions that are characterised by a broad spectrum of depositional processes and grainsizes. Second order subduction events (e.g. ridge or plateau collision) can disrupt these processes over several millions of years and elicit depositional responses that are discordant within the forearc stratigraphy. These responses thus constitute stratigraphic signals of such events, but can be difficult to decipher owing to the stratigraphic complexity and inherently destructive nature of marine forearcs. Stratigraphic interpretations for well-preserved clastic and volcanic successions in Marlborough, in New Zealand’s South Island, have long held that between 105 and 95 Ma deposition took place into a series of nascent rift basins, consistent with extension elsewhere in New Zealand. We propose a new stratigraphic framework for Marlborough for the New Zealand Urutawan-Motuan (108.4 to 99.5 Ma) and Ngaterian (99.5 to 95.2 Ma) that instead describes deposition within a coastal plain and attached marine basins during ongoing subduction of the Phoenix Plate. We posit that between 108.4 and 95.2 Ma, hiatus conditions, coarse mass-wasting (including olistostromes), prolific highstand deposition and forearc exhumation punctuated by forearc volcanism represent a significant disruption of preceding depositional patterns. The synchronicity, long-term cyclicity (1 to 5 Ma) and regional extent of these stratigraphic changes indicate that regional tectonism underpinned deposition, which we attribute to second order subduction events along the mid-Cretaceous convergent margin . The stratigraphic framework presented here is consistent with regional geochronologic, stratigraphic and plate reconstruction data that independently argue for continued Phoenix Plate subduction after 92 and as late as 86 Ma. This study underlines the complexity of plate margin dynamics and the complications produced by second order subduction events. The framework presented here indicates that subduction and continental extension were contemporaneous, which following subduction shutdown led to continental breakup from 85 Ma. A stratigraphic record of these events is preserved within the exhumed forearc in Marlborough, which continued to accumulate sediments despite the profound plate-scale events taking place below. ]"

Impacts of salinity on food and water security and agricultural livelihoods are well documented and reviewed herein, along with additional effects on human health that have received less attention and warrant further study. Populations forced to consume saline waters display increased occurrence of diseases such as hypertension in Bangladesh, particularly among the rural poor in coastal areas. This review synthesizes knowledge on socio-hydrological drivers of salinization in large river deltas globally. Multiple drivers arise at different scales and include agricultural practices, upstream water diversion, and relative sea level rise and can be amplified through feedback from inappropriate adaptation strategies.

This review focuses on two controversial issues: (1) which one was the primary controlling factor of the Triassic geodynamic process of the South China Block (SCB), oceanic subduction or intracontinental convergence? (2) what was the subduction style of the Paleo-Pacific plate during the Jurassic–Cretaceous? Based on analyses of regional deformation and published geochronological, petrological, and Nd isotopic data of the magmatic rocks, we reconstruct the Mesozoic tectonic architecture and determined the temporal and spatial evolution of magmatic activities in the ESCB. The analysis of regional deformation shows that two groups of folds, including NE/NNE-trending folds in the Cathaysia Block and NW/NWW-trending folds in the inland, were formed in the Middle–Late Triassic. Subsequently, Middle–Late Jurassic NW–SE compression led to large-scale NE-trending fold-thrust deformation in the SCB, except for roughly S–N extension in the eastern Nanling tectonic belt, which caused the occurrence of the NE-striking dextral-normal oblique faults. Geochronological data indicate that magmatism in the ESCB can be divided into five separate stages: at 250–210 Ma, 210–170 Ma, 170–145 Ma, 145–120 Ma, and 120–85 Ma, respectively. In the first stage, granitic rocks consist mainly of S- and A-type granites, with subordinate I-type granites. These three types of granites were all derived from the partial melting of Proterozoic rocks. In the second stage, the magmatic activities are characterized by mantle-derived magmas in the coastal area, while they are featured by the mixing of predominantly mantle-derived melts with the Neoproterozoic crust in the inland area. In the third stage, widespread I- and A-type granites, which are characterized by the crust-mantle mixing, were formed in the Nanling tectonic belt and adjacent regions in response to the intense extension of lithosphere. In contrast, the development of crust-derived magmas in the Wuyi tectonic belt indicates a relatively weak lithosphere extension. The granitoids of the fourth stage, which are composed of I- and A-type granites, are mainly distributed in two separate areas, the eastern Jiangnan Orogenic Belt and southeastern Guangdong Province. Their petrogenesis is related to the crust-mantle mixing under the extensional setting. The magmatic activities in the last stage propagated eastward and were developed in the coastal area. The intrusive suites comprise major I- and A-type granitoids, and minor gabbroids, which were formed in an enhanced lithospheric extensional setting. Combined with the records of regional deformation, sedimentology, and magmatic evolution, we propose a new tectonic evolution model for the ESCB covering the range of ca. 270 Ma to 85 Ma. This model demonstrates that the ESCB probably experienced a coeval multi-plate convergence during the Triassic, producing an intracontinental deformation belt in the Yangtze Block and an Andean-type retro-arc foreland system in the Cathaysia Block. During the Jurassic–Cretaceous period, the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate beneath the SCB triggered crustal thickening, local extension, and large-scale lithospheric extension through the advance, tearing, rollback, and breakoff of the oceanic slab. ]"

It is apparent that this integrated aquaculture-agriculture system is suited to environmental and hydrological conditions found in specific areas. Production strategies devised by farmers demonstrate that the diversified culture of shrimp with rice is technically feasible. Shrimp-rice agroecosystems exhibit several synergistic effects between systems components that result in efficient resource use and enhanced production, whilst avoiding negative environmental impacts. Integrated cropping enhances agrobiodiversity and reduces dependence on external inputs (agrochemicals, feed and fertiliser). Diversified shrimp-rice culture produces a valuable export crop, stimulating economic development and staple cereal, fish and vegetable crops that enhance human nutrition and food security.

Although bauxite formation declined globally from the Carboniferous to the Permian in conjunction with global cooling, it was an interval of widespread bauxite formation in China. In South China, (1) the Jiujialu Formation bauxite deposits in central and northern Guizhou (Zunyi area) are of early-middle Visean age; (2) the Dazhuyaun Formation bauxite deposits in northern Guizhou (Wuchuan–Zheng'an–Daozheng area) to southern Chongqing (Nanchuan area) and southeastern Guizhou (Fuquan–Kaili area) are of Late Pennsylvanian–Early Permian age; and (3) the Heshan Formation bauxite deposits in western Guangxi to Yunnan are of Middle–Late Permian age. In North China, the Benxi Formation bauxite deposits are of Late Mississippian–Middle Pennsylvanian age. The contrasting trends in bauxite metallogenesis between China and the rest of the world imply different climatic patterns in the eastern Tethys (high annual humidity with seasonal dryness) and Pangea (aridification). This hypothesis is further supported by differences in the chemical index of alteration, or CIA (&gt;80 in the eastern Tethys vs. ~50 in western Pangea), and in paleotemperatures (mean annual temperature, or MAT = ~20 °C in the eastern Tethys vs. ~4 °C in western Pangea) determined from Permo-Carboniferous siliciclastic deposits . Permo-Carboniferous bauxite deposits in South China formed in coastal plain and coastal karstic depression environments, in which the position of the groundwater table was related to sea-level changes. During the late Paleozoic, high-frequency eustatic fluctuations caused by waxing and waning of Gondwana icesheets controlled sedimentation in these coastal depositional systems, leading to cyclic accumulation of coal and bauxite deposits and cycles of vadose- and phreatic-type bauxite formation. The results of the present study show that, during interglacial stages, lateritization resulted from high p CO 2 , high sea-level and groundwater-table elevations, low precipitation, and limited vegetation cover, whereas during glacial stages, bauxitization of these ferralitic weathering products was promoted by low p CO 2 , low sea-level and groundwater-table elevations, high precipitation, and more extensive vegetation cover. Thus, a unique combination of geographic, climatic, and eustatic factors accounted for widespread formation of bauxite in South China during the LPIA. ]"

Factors controlling terrigenous particle input, transportation, and accumulation on the shelf, the adjacent continental slope and the deep sea of the Arctic Ocean are river discharge, coastal erosion, sea ice and icebergs , ocean currents, gravitational flows, and, although of minor importance, aeolian supply. The amount and composition of particulate organic-carbon (OC) preserved in the sedimentary records are controlled by different factors such as terrigenous input, primary production, transformation processes in the water column and at the seafloor as well as bulk sedimentation rates . The chapter states that the modern Arctic Ocean OC accumulation is strongly controlled by terrigenous input, in contrast to the other world oceans. Owing to the high fluvial and coastal erosion sediment supply, terrigenous OC is predominant in the Kara, Laptev, and Beaufort seas as well as the central Arctic Ocean. ]"

Identifying the synoptic patterns that produce extreme waves is necessary to understand the wave climate for a specific location. Thus, a characterization of these weather patterns may allow the study of the relationships between the magnitude and occurrence of extreme wave events and the climate system. The aim of this paper is to analyze the interannual variability of extreme wave heights. For this purpose, we present a methodological framework and its application to an area over the North East (NE) Atlantic Ocean. The climatology in the NE Atlantic is analyzed using the self-organizing maps (SOMs). The application of this clustering technique to monthly mean sea level pressure fields provides a continuum of synoptic categorizations compared with discrete realizations produced through most traditional methods. The extreme wave climate has been analyzed by means of monthly maxima of the significant wave height (SWH) in several locations over the NE Atlantic. A statistical approach based on a time-dependent generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution has been applied. The seasonal variation was characterized and, afterwards, the interannual variability was studied throughout regional pressure patterns. The anomalies of the 50-year return level estimates of SWH, due to interannual variability have been projected into the weather types of SOM. It provides a comprehensive visual representation, which relates the weather type with the positive or negative contribution to extreme waves over the selected locations. ]"

Most studies link the aeolian coastal deposits to regressive phases, some to high sea-level stands, and a few to intermediate relative sea-level positions. We interpret the apparent contradictions as indicating the lack of an over-arching concept and the inconsistent usage of sea level-related terms. In this paper we present an integrated morpho-sedimentological concept for a microtidal, mid-latitudinal coast and review existing data from the Levant (East Mediterranean) coast to evaluate the concept and to eliminate nomenclatural confusion. A coastal depositional environment in a semi-arid environment consists of shallow-marine, aeolian and alluvial facies which together form an aeolian beach-ridge complex as a package of strata which respond simultaneously to sea-level change. A transgressive complex forms through reworking or overstepping of the coastal foredune and a regressive complex forms by downstepping. Under transgression the aeolian beach ridge represents the highstand deposit and its adjacent shallow marine sediment is the transgressive deposit. Under regression the complex represents the falling stage and the associated downdip surface marks the lowstand . On the Levant coast we find chronologically well-constrained, offlapping aeolian beach ridges as parts of six downstepping beach ridge complexes formed between ~ 200 ka and 10 ka. The complexes represent the falling stage systems tract (FSST) of a short-lived (5th-order) depositional sequence when the shoreline shifted from a position close to the modern coastline to the shelf or below the shelf edge. Three of these FSSTs and their up dip and down dip super bounding surface together form the 4th order (~ 100 ka) sequence of the last interglacial/glacial cycle. The absence of transgressive, highstand and lowstand systems tract is explained by the poor preservation potential due to the small sediment budget of the complex. The falling stage complex has a high preservation potential because sediment source area increases while the sand drift potential remains above the local threshold. On the Levant coast, sand delivery to the backshore continued during relative sea-level falls for distances of up to 10 km between dune and coastline which is unprecedented in most modern analogues. The significance of the dune–soil succession for climate is limited because the dunes are governed by relative sea-level change; the vegetation response to changes in precipitation is non-linear and the dune dynamics are characterised by low resilience and hysteresis . ]"

These assemblages provide important reservoir spaces for oil and gas. To establish a systematic understanding of, and scientific basis for, oil and gas exploration , this paper reviews the major genetic environments of evaporite–carbonate assemblages and associated hydrocarbon reservoirs . Based on the review, carbonate reservoir-forming marine evaporite sequence worldwide can be categorized into four major settings: marginal-marine sabkhas , marginal-marine evaporative lagoons, coastal salinas and regional evaporite basins. In addition, a new type of reservoir that developed in the Ordos Basin of China during the Ordovician greenhouse is proposed based on a synthesis of new and existing chemical and physical data. This new model is identified in the supra-salt reservoir in the fifth Member of the Middle Ordovician Majiagou Formation in the Ordos Basin and is termed an “epeiric basin-scale moldic reservoirs”. In this newly identified type of dolomite reservoir, irregular–circular moldic pores and vugs that are uniformly distributed in micritic dolomite matrix formed high-quality reservoir spaces, examples of which are rare worldwide to date. The primary evaporitic mineral in these molds is disseminated halite crystal, which formed in a restricted and evaporitic epeiric-basin environment. The selective dissolution of disseminated halite crystals and enlargement of its surrounding rocks in the upper part of the sedimentary cycle by meteoric water during late highstand system tract formed the unique distribution of halite-moldic pores and vugs. Within the evaporitic epeiric basin, high-frequency sea-level fluctuation and syngenetic exposure are also likely to have occurred, conditions that have been neglected in the classic models. Coupling of the extremely high atmospheric CO 2 content, low-amplitude location and high-frequency sea-level fluctuations during the Middle Ordovician greenhouse, together with the flat and broad restricted evaporative environment, controlled the formation of this rare end-member sedimentary assemblage and associated reservoirs. The reservoirs were developed within the sedimentary framework of the North China Platform, which was characterized by a general depression surrounded by three uplifted areas during the Middle Ordovician Majiagou period. The model characterized by epeiric basin-scale disseminated evaporites allowed the formation of reservoirs with high exploration potential. Exploration of this type of reservoir requires that attention is paid to hydrocarbon sweet spots generated by later diagenesis and to heterogeneous hydrocarbon accumulation. ]"

Here we demonstrate, based upon a new data compilation from more than 240 late-Mesozoic fluorite deposits in southeast China that most of them can be divided into three fluorite deposit belts (FDB) with distinct ages and orientations. The two older inland FDB with a NE-SW orientation were formed at 165–150 Ma and 150–130 Ma, respectively, whereas the younger coastal FDB, roughly perpendicular to the others, was generated at 110–70 Ma. The temporal-spatial distributions of the FDB are compatible with the subduction of the (paleo-) Pacific plate . We propose that the genesis of the earlier two inland FDB was due to northeastward slab rollback during low-angle subduction, while formation of the coastal FDB resulted mainly from high-angle northwestward hot/warm subduction. Large amounts of F, mainly derived from the decomposition of phengite (±apatite) in the subducted slabs, could be transported into the overlying crust via F-rich fluids and alkalic magmas. Subsequently, extensive crustal magmatism and fluid activities associated with subduction further concentrate F from the magmas and/or wall-rocks and facilitate fluorite mineralization. This study provides new insights into the interaction between the subducting (paleo-) Pacific plate and overlying eastern Eurasian continent in the late Mesozoic. It also highlights the potential genetic association of F transport/deposition with plate subduction that could be a common phenomenon in ancient and modern subduction zones. ]"

The occurrence of various karren features was measured on slopes with different inclination. The occurrence of various karren features on slopes has been presented according to slope inclination values. The slopes were put into slope categories and their karren features were given. Thus, the karren formation of the bare slopes of various karst types and karst features (glaciokarst, coastal karst, tropical karst, mediterranean karst, collapse dolines , gorges, caves etc.) can be described. It can be stated that on limestone with the increase of the inclination of the bearing slope, the diversity of karren features decreases and those of flow origin will be increasingly dominant. However, with the increase of slope inclination, features of flow origin will be increasingly simpler. On limestone, on slopes with a smaller dip and on slopes of less soluble rocks, the distribution of karren features of seepage origin increases. On glaciokarst, where bare slopes are widespread and of various inclination, karren are diverse and the distribution of various types is also considerable. In other karst areas, small-inclined slopes (coastal karst, tropical karst) or very large-inclined slopes (tropical karst, collapse dolines) are predominant and thus, the distribution of some karren features (e.g. rinnenkarren) is limited. The change of slope inclination may result in the change of karren formation. On glaciokarst, bare and subsoil karren formation are separated from each other, on mediterranean and tropical karst, they are less separated from each other and the latter prepares the former. On halite , the effect of slope inclination on karren formation may be modified by intensive dissolution. The karren formations of halite and tropical karst are partly similar which can be explained by intensive dissolution in both cases. ]"

Microfossils , such as diatoms, incorporated into coastal stratigraphy provide some of the most detailed reconstructions of the history of earthquakes and tsunamis. We explore qualitative and quantitative techniques that employ the relation between diatoms and salinity , tidal elevation, and life form to: (1) reconstruct records of vertical land-level change associated with large earthquakes; and (2) identify anomalous sand and silt beds deposited by tsunamis. A global database shows that diatoms have been successfully employed in the reconstruction of earthquake and tsunami histories in Chile, the Indian Ocean, Japan, New Zealand, the North Sea, the Pacific Northwest of North America, and the South Pacific. We use case studies from some of these locations to highlight advancements in the field and new capabilities that diatoms have enabled. Examples from the Pacific Northwest of North America illustrate the evolution of quantitative diatom-based reconstructions of earthquake-related land-level change. In Alaska and Japan, diatoms have documented land-level changes throughout the earthquake deformation cycle, including possible preseismic land-level change signals and postseismic deformation. Diatoms helped identify coseismic uplift along the central Chile subduction zone coast, and uplift and subsidence along the Alaska–Aleutian megathrust, expanding our knowledge of the variability of slip in megathrust ruptures. In tsunami studies, diatoms help determine the provenance of anomalous sands and silts found in low-energy coastal stratigraphic sequences. In Japan, allochthonous marine and brackish diatoms within sand deposits signaled repeated marine incursions into a coastal lake, helping identify a possible predecessor to the 2011 Tohoku tsunami. In the Pacific Northwest of North America and Chile, diatoms were used to estimate tsunami run-up beyond the landward limit of tsunami sedimentation. Examples from the North Sea, Thailand, and Japan show how the fragmentation and sorting of diatom valves may provide evidence of high-energy transport during the rapid, turbulent flow of a tsunami. To conclude, we emphasize the importance of studying the modern diatom response to changes in land level and/or tsunami inundation to improve diatom-based records of prehistoric earthquakes and tsunamis. ]"

Research on polynyas during the last twenty years has allowed multi-disciplinary evaluation of processes in various polynyas, including the Northeast Water (NEW) polynya, North Water (NOW) polynya, St. Lawrence Island polynya (SLIP), and the Bathurst (BATH) polynya in the Arctic, and the Ross Sea polynya (RSP), McMurdo Sound polynya (MSP), and Terra Nova Bay (TNB) polynya in the Antarctic. Several other coastal polynyas around Antarctica have received limited study. Studies of benthic patterns and processes in polynyas indicate that faunal biomass, productivity, and carbon cycling are dependent on depth, season, ice cover, carbon supply, and hydrographic forcing. Polynyas generally have high primary productivity, which typically supports rich benthic communities through enhanced vertical carbon flux . Short and long-term indicators can provide a “foot print” of water column processes within polynyas, such as sediment community oxygen consumption and benthic biomass. Although zooplankton production directly influences the retentive nature of carbon in the euphotic zone , depth is the critical factor for the impact of net carbon export to the underlying benthos. We use a simple modeling exercise of two polynya case studies, the SLIP in the Arctic and RSP in the Antarctic, to evaluate export efficiency and benthic carbon cycling. Depth ultimately influences whether a polynya is a “retentive” versus “export” ecosystem, impacting the underlying benthic populations and associated carbon cycling. Defining polynyas and marginal ice zones as retentive versus export systems is potentially a powerful tool for understanding polar shelf processes, particularly when primary production is not measured simultaneously with benthic parameters. ]"

Over the last half century, the effects of catchment conditions in determining fluvial sediment supply have been exacerbated or moderated by dams and reservoirs. The sediment balance of river deltas, crucial in terms of delta shoreline stability, advance or retreat, and subsidence , has, in turn, been affected by variations in fluvial sediment supply. The shoreline mobility and resulting subaerial coastal area changes of a selection of 54 of the world’s deltas was quantified over 30 years based on data culled from the literature and from satellite images. These changes were analyzed alongside fluvial sediment loads. Delta shoreline mobility in response to changing fluvial loads has been variable, reflecting the miscellaneous factors that influence the supply of sediment to deltas. 29 deltas are in overall erosion, 18 show shoreline advance, whereas seven do not show any significant change. The sediment loads received by 42 deltas diminished relative to values prior to 1970, by more than 50% for 28 of them. Ten deltas showed advance, some significantly, notwithstanding fluvial sediment load decreases exceeding 25%. Overall, with the exception of the Colorado (Tx) and the Indus, losses in subaerial coastal area have been rather low. It would appear that diminishing fluvial sediment supply, the driving force in deltaic equilibrium at a multi-decadal timescale, has not, thus far, had a significant negative impact on multi-decadal delta shoreline mobility. This is important in terms of gauging currently perceived delta vulnerability. Notwithstanding, a clear link exists between the mobility of delta shorelines and the reduction in fluvial sediment loads. Eroding deltas have been affected by a reduction that is twice as important as that of stable or advancing deltas since 1970. Dams currently in place will reduce, in the future, the sediment load to their deltas of 25 of the 54 rivers by more than 50% and 100% for 15 of them. It is important to envisage the supply of sediment to deltas less in terms of its direct role in generating accretion, and eventual delta shoreline advance, and more in terms of an agent of resilience. The reduction of fluvial sediment supply to deltas will negatively impact their resilience to other drivers in the future: anthropogenic, climate change, and sea-level rise. The variability of delta shoreline behavior in the face of changing fluvial sediment loads also calls for more in-depth studies of individual deltas in order to build up future management plans addressing vulnerability and loss of resilience to marine forcing, subsidence , and sea-level rise. ]"

This contribution focuses on biogeochemical processes in the northern Benguela Upwelling System (NBUS), where low oxygen levels in upwelling source water are a major influence on carbon and nutrient cycles. Based on measurements during numerous expeditions and results of 3-D regional ecosystem modeling (project GENUS; Geochemistry and Ecology of the Namibian Upwelling System) we here examine source water character, effects of low oxygen conditions on nutrient masses and ratios, and of diazotrophic N 2 -fixation on productivity of the system and its transition to the adjacent eastern South Atlantic. In available observations, the effects of denitrification in water and sediment and phosphate release from sediments are minor influences on nitrate:phosphate ratios of the system, and excess phosphate in aged upwelling water is inherited from upwelling source water. Contrary to expectation and model results, the low N:P ratios do not trigger diazotrophic N 2 -fixation in the fringes of the upwelling system, possibly due to a lack of seeding populations of Trichodesmium . We also examine the flux of carbon from the sea surface to either sediment, the adjacent sub-thermocline ocean, or to regenerated nutrients and CO 2 . Observed fluxes out of the surface mixed layer are significantly below modeled fluxes, and suggest that regeneration of nutrients and CO 2 is unusually intense in the mixed layer. This contributes to very high fluxes of CO 2 from the ocean to the regional atmosphere, which is not compensated for by N 2 -fixation. Based on observations, the NBUS thus is a significant net CO 2 source (estimated at 14.8 Tg C a − 1 ), whereas the CO 2 balance is closed by N 2 -fixation in the model. Methane concentrations were low in surface waters in on-line measurements during 1 expedition, and based on these our estimate for the emission of methane for the entire Benguela system is below 0.2 Tg CH 4 a − 1 . ]"

The bycatch impact on this humpback population has been overlooked. Based on the annual bycatch mortality documented in this study, about 0.53% (95% CI 0.2–1.5%) of the population might be potentially bycaught in gillnets annually. Depending on the total population numbers estimated and reported elsewhere for this stock (2917 or 6277 whales), the bycatch mortality is equivalent to 15 or 33 whales per year. A significant correlation was found between the annual bycatch rate and fishing effort for the period 2000–2009 ( r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.05). An increase in artisanal fisheries may cause drastic consequences since humpback whales as K-strategists have low birth and survival rates. Calves are probably the most threatened age class due to gillnet entanglements in proximity to coastal waters where artisanal vessels operate. The Ecuadorian breeding grounds for humpback whales migrating from Antarctica might become a hot spot for bycatch in the Southeastern Tropical Pacific, if the bycatch rate continues to increase. Urgent mitigation strategies coupled with precautionary management and conservation measures are required to protect this vulnerable stock of whales in the long term. The consequences of humpback whale bycatch off coastal Ecuador and possible solutions to mitigate the bycatch are analyzed. ]"

The assessment is done in two ways: First, the existing in-situ observing platforms contributing to GOOS (floats, surface drifters, moorings, research/commercial ships) are characterized in terms of their current capabilities in sampling key physical and bio-geochemical oceanic processes. Next the gliders’ capabilities are evaluated in the context of key applications. This includes an evaluation of 140 references presented in the peer-reviewed literature. It is found that GOOS has adequate coverage of sampling in the open ocean for several physical processes. There is a lack of data in the present GOOS in the transition regions between the open ocean and shelf seas. However, most of the documented scientific glider applications operate in this region, suggesting that a sustained glider component in the GOOS could fill that gap. Glider data are included for routine product generation (e.g. alerts, maps). Other noteworthy process-oriented applications where gliders are important survey tools include local sampling of the (sub)mesoscale, sampling in shallow coastal areas, measurements in hazardous environments, and operational monitoring. In most cases, the glider studies address investigations and monitoring of processes across multiple disciplines, making use of the ease to implement a wide range of sensors to gliders. The maturity of glider operations, the wide range of applications that map onto growing GOOS regional needs, and the maturity of glider data flow all justify the formal implementation of gliders into the GOOS. Remaining challenges include the execution of coordinated multinational missions in a sustained mode as well as considering capacity-building aspects in glider operations as well as glider data use. ]"

Occurrence and distribution of Hippohaë rhamnoides during the British Pleistocene. Paleoecological and biostratigraphical significance. , Recent palaeobotanical analyses of Middle Pleistocene fossiliferous lacustrine sediments (correlated with the late Anglian and the early Hoxnian Stages) collected from East Farm, Barnham, Suffolk, UK yielded the characteristic trichomes (scales) of Hippophaë rhamnoides L. together with its pollen grains. Trichomes are rarely recorded from British Pleistocene sediments. Published palynological data suggests that this species was present at certain times to varying degrees during the British Pleistocene epoch , first being recorded in the late Early Pleistocene (Beestonian Stage). During the Middle Pleistocene it is well represented either side of the Anglian Stage/Hoxnian Stage boundary in Britain, while there are other occurrences of lower frequency in the latter part of the Pleistocene. These considerations prompted a review of the presence of this species in the British Isles during the Pleistocene. Today, in northwest Europe Hippophaë rhamnoides L. is predominantly a coastal plant with native populations found on the eastern and south-eastern coastlines of England. Elsewhere on mainland Europe it can also be found growing in river valleys and other inland areas where suitable conditions prevail. The inland British Pleistocene records probably reflect this species exploiting favourable conditions in recently deglaciated open areas. It may be regarded as a pioneer shrub occurring early on in a vegetation succession, being out-competed by later arriving tree species because of its intolerance of shade. Warmer temperatures later in the interglacial vegetation cycle may have also contributed to its demise as the seeds need a degree of cold pre-treatment to prompt germination. ]"

Beach ridges are present up to 10 m above current highest tide level (hTw) and date to the early mid-Holocene transgression maximum. Beach-ridge deposits represent high-energy, wave dominated coastal environments, whereas valley-mouth terraces and littoral terraces (elevations of 5.5–6.5 m above hTw) developed in wave-protected coastal environments. The surface elevation of these littoral forms suggest that the middle and south Patagonian Atlantic coast is likely undergoing a slow glacio-isostatic uplift on the order of 0.3–0.4 mm/a since the mid-Holocene. The early Holocene sea-level rise reached the modern coastline by 8100 14 C years ago (c. 8600 cal BP) at the latest. Sea level at that time was most likely near its present position. The Holocene transgression maximum lasted from 6900 to at least 6200 14 C BP (c. 7400 to 6600 cal BP), raising relative sea level to about 2 m to a maximum of 3 m above the present level, after which sea level declined to the present level. Two significant sea-level falls of at most 1 m occurred: a) between 6200 and 6000 14 C BP (c. 6600 to 6400 cal BP), and b) between 2600 and 2400 14 C BP (c. 2300 to 2050 cal BP). We assume, that both significant sea-level falls were predominantly driven by eustatic changes of ocean volume, whereas both thermo-steric changes and changes of tides may also have contributed to these relatively strong sea-level drops. Gravitational changes driven by Greenland ice growth ( sensu Mitrovica et al., 2001) may also have amplified any eustatic portion of sea-level fall. The trend of a general sea-level decline since the mid-Holocene transgression maximum seems to be predominantly glacio-isostatically driven. ]"

The scale effects of turbulence cause the deviation between in situ measurements and flume experiments. The threshold (critical Shields parameter) is now a function of at least six variables. , The definition of the threshold of sediment motion is critical for continental shelf sediment dynamics. The work by A. Shields laid the foundation for this research direction, leading to the well-known Shields curve. Here we review the most widely used threshold curves that have followed from the original Shields curve over the last 80 years, and propose that in terms of physical processes the threshold (critical Shields parameter) is a function of at least six variables, i.e. grain Reynolds number, grain size distribution, sphericity, roundness, particle cohesiveness and the scale effects of turbulence. Identifying these key factors, we paid a special attention to the role of the scale effects of turbulence. Turbulence was thought to be a random process, but the improvement of measurement techniques revealed that it has both temporal and spatial structures: the magnitude of instantaneous velocity fluctuations varies in time and in location, which can cause the deviation between in situ measurements and flume experiments . In coastal and shelf waters, in situ measurements of tidal currents and suspended sediment concentrations have revealed that resuspension takes place even though the bed shear stress is well below the Shields curve. Further process and mechanism studies are required to improve the theoretical framework regarding the turbulence structures and their interplay with sediment threshold. The scientific problems for future studies include the establishment of laboratory experiments, in situ measurements and process-based modelling under different water depths and hydrodynamic conditions to quantify the scale effects of turbulence; the development of new observation techniques for higher resolution and for extreme environments; development of new data processing methods, including big data methods to analyse turbulence structures; and the quantification of the effects of biological contributions and non-particle components on the family of Shields curves. ]"

The withdrawal of glacier ice exposes landscapes that are in an unstable or metastable state , and consequently liable to modification, erosion and sediment release at rates greatly exceeding background denudation rates. This paper (1) reviews research on paraglacial processes, landforms and landscape change in a range of geomorphological settings; (2) explores the importance of paraglacial landscape modification and sediment recycling as a component of alternating glacial/nonglacial landscape evolution ; (3) assesses the nature and significance of paraglacial facies in Quaternary stratigraphic sequences; and (4) develops a general model of the sequence of paraglacial landscape modification and the changing nature of paraglacial landsystems. Six paraglacial landsystems are identified: rock slopes, drift-mantled slopes, glacier forelands, and alluvial, lacustrine and coastal systems. Each contains a wide range of paraglacial landforms and sediment facies. Collectively these landforms and sediments (e.g. talus accumulations, debris cones, alluvial fans, valley fills, deltas and coastal barrier structures) can be conceptualised as storage components of an interrupted sediment cascade with four primary sources (rockwalls, drift-mantled slopes, valley-floor glacigenic deposits and coastal glacigenic deposits) and four terminal sediment sinks (alluvial valley-fill deposits, lacustrine deposits , coastal/nearshore deposits and shelf/offshore deposits). Paraglacial sediment stores and sinks may form major sources of readily erodible sediment during the early stages of glacial cycles, leading to high rates of sediment transport during periods of glacier or ice-sheet expansion. Probably because of the limited preservation potential of paraglacial sediments that were subsequently over-run by glacier ice, identification of paraglacial facies in both terrestrial and marine settings has been almost exclusively limited to sequences that post-date the Last Glacial Maximum . The unifying concept of paraglacial geomorphology is that of glacially conditioned sediment availability. Relaxation of landscape elements to nonglacial conditions operates over timescales of 10 1 –&gt;10 4 years, and is conditioned by both process and spatial scale. Rate of sediment reworking can be described by an exhaustion model. In the case of primary reworking of glacigenic sediment, the rate of reworking declines approximately exponentially through time, though extrinsic perturbation may rejuvenate paraglacial sediment flux long after termination of the initial period of paraglacial adjustment. Landscape-scale (particularly alluvial and coastal) systems may exhibit intrinsically complex responses due to reworking of secondary paraglacial sediment stores. The long relaxation time of such systems implies that many areas deglaciated in the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene have still not fully adjusted (in terms of sediment supply) to nonglacial conditions. ]"

They are located at the west margin of the Guadalquivir river estuary . The accumulation of aeolian sands partly blocks the connection between the ample Guadalquivir River estuary and the Gulf of Cádiz in the Atlantic Ocean. The sand units form a large oval dome, the “Abalario Dome” which connects with the large Doñana Spit Bar where dune systems accumulated as well, at least in part coevally with the spit growth. The most frequent dune morphologies are parabolic or transverse. The degree of activity was classified as stable, semi-active and active. Most stable dunes concentrate on the Abalario Dome, whereas active dunes occur mainly on the Doñana spit bar. Relative chronology was established from the superposition of dune Systems and Subsystems deduced from photogeology coupled with field surveys, orthophotos , and oblique and 3D images. Sampling and radiogenic dating (Optically Stimulated Luminescence-OSL) allowed to date eight dune Systems named as Systems I to VII plus an additional CS, which is a laterally equivalent to part of S IV, V and VI. The proposed ages are: System I, age 11.1 38 to 9.5 ky BP, perhaps extending to 8.5 ky BP. System II, 8.2 to 6.1 ky BP. System III, 5.9 to 2.6 ky BP. 39 System IV, 2.6 to 1.6 ky BP.

In three stratigraphic sections studied in the coastal area of the Yucatan Peninsula and the island of Cozumel, multiple levels of calcretes and palustrine carbonates were identified. The presence of these continental carbonates combined with calcarenites suggests a transition from a shallow marine deposit to a continental environment for paleosol development. This research analyzes the geochemical (δ 13 C and δ 18 O), mineralogical and micromorphological characteristics of the calcarenite , palustrine carbonate and calcretes to infer their paleoenvironmental formation conditions. The mineralogy of the samples consists entirely of aragonite and calcite . The micromorphology allowed us to identify α-calcretes and β-calcretes, as well as palustrine carbonates such as peloidal and mottled limestones. The isotopic signature of Palustrine carbonate has an intermediate isotopic signature (δ 13 C mean value of −5.24‰, δ 18 O mean value of −4.9‰), falling between that of calcarenites and calcretes. The δ 13 C (ranging from −10.10 to −7.50‰) and δ 18 O (−5.63 to −4.64‰) values of all calcretes analyzed in this work are similar to the values reported for the Pleistocene and Holocene calcretes exposed in the Caribbean Sea region. Isotopic values of δ 13 C in the studied sections are interpreted as the result of a change in vegetation from a predominant C3 vegetation associated with a cool-wet climate to a C3/C4 mixed vegetation, which is a plant cover that grows in a drier-hotter climate. ]"

To investigate the nature of this change, we present a new record from Lake Elsinore, located 36 km inland from the Pacific Ocean in Southern California and evaluate it in the context of records across the coastal and interior southwest United States, including northwest Mexico. The sediment core recovered from Lake Elsinore provides a continuous sequence with multi-decadal resolution spanning 19–9 ka BP. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses reveal hydrologic variability. In particular, sand and carbonate components indicate abrupt changes at the Oldest Dryas (OD), Bølling–Allerød (BA), and Younger Dryas (YD) transitions, consistent with the timing in Greenland. Hydrogen isotope analyses of the C 28 n -alkanoic acids from plant leaf waxes ( δ D wax ) reveal a long term trend toward less negative values across 19−9 ka BP. δ D wax values during the OD suggest a North Pacific moisture source for precipitation, consistent with the dipping westerlies hypothesis. We find no isotopic evidence for the North American Monsoon reaching as far west as Lake Elsinore; therefore, we infer that wet/dry changes in the coastal southwest were expressed through winter-season precipitation, consistent with modern climatology . Comparing Lake Elsinore to other southwest records (notably Cave of Bells and Fort Stanton) we find coincident timing of the major transitions (OD to BA, BA to YD) and hydrologic responses during the OD and BA. The hydrologic response, however, varied during the YD consistent with a dipole between the coastal and interior southwest. The coherent pattern of hydrologic responses across the interior southwest US and northwest Mexico during the OD (wet), the BA (drier), and YD (wet) follows changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, presumably via its combined influence on North Pacific winter storm tracks and the extent/magnitude of the North American Monsoon . In contrast, Lake Elsinore and the coastal southwest experiences a deglacial drying trend punctuated by abrupt change at the OD to BA and BA to YD transitions. This trend tracks rising greenhouse gases through the deglacial, with an apparent southward shift in westerly moisture sources adjusting to the retreating ice sheet. ]"

Using a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic numerical model (MOBEEHDYCS), and realistic bathymetry and coastline of the northern Brazilian shelf, this paper aims at studying the influence of some specific physical processes on the morphology of the Amazon plume. The very large volume discharge (180 000 m 3 /s on average) and the weak effect of Coriolis force are additional characteristics of the studied system, which induce a particular dynamics. The various forcing factors are successively introduced into the model in order to simulate and to determine their respective influences upon the plume extent and the hydrodynamics at the shelf scale.

With this background, various aspects of evacuation behaviour have been investigated in past earthquake and tsunami events, but have not been organised to provide an overview of the general tsunami evacuation process. In this paper, we reviewed 39 reports and articles that surveyed actual human responses in past 22 tsunami-related events and organised the existing findings on human behaviour during tsunamis into a theoretical framework: a tsunami evacuation process that describes general human behavioural components and notifications during tsunami events. The framework illustrates the continuous psychological and physical process in tsunami evacuation and the dynamical transition of notifications during tsunamis. Since the tsunami evacuation process provides a clear overview of the components of the tsunami evacuation process, it enables researchers design survey questions for comprehensive investigations of tsunami evacuations and leads a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of human behaviour in tsunamis that will contribute to consider more appropriate evacuation preparedness for future tsunamis. ]"

Through the 1997–1998 El Niño, waters with less than 1 μM NO 3 covered 250,000 km 2 area greater than 1999. Silicate levels as low as 0.2 μM were observed in coastal waters, suggesting that diatom growth may have been nutrient limited both in 1998 and 1999. Detailed sampling off the southern coast of British Columbia revealed that 1998 nitrate levels were only half the average of that during the 1970s winter, were depleted 1 month earlier in spring and remained low throughout the summer. Satellite images show that, compared to 1997 and 1999, chlorophyll levels were much lower in the spring of 1998 throughout the coastal waters of the Gulf of Alaska. Conditions changed dramatically during the 1999 La Niña, with ocean-mixed layer depths increasing by 20 m in winter and 40 m in spring when compared to that during 1997–1998 El Niño. Winter nutrient levels increased and summer upwelling returned. Over the past several decades, a trend towards greater stratification of coastal waters appears to be affecting the supply of nutrients to the mixed layer. The effects of stratification were especially obvious during the 1998 El Niño. ]"

In contrast to the wealth of research on hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes on sandy coasts, comparable studies on gravel beaches are few. The paucity of detailed process measurements on these beaches has been attributed to the difficulty of deploying sensitive equipment in energetic environments with mobile gravel-size clasts . Gravel beaches are, however, rather paradoxical in terms of mobility. The specific morphological features of gravel beach shorefaces, notably the lack or the poor development of a surf zone , imply a significant role by swash zone processes acting on the steep beachface, notably the control of swash asymmetry on beach gradients and in accretion or erosion phases. While swash processes are undoubtedly important in controlling the morphology of gravel beaches, the character of swash is dependent on the transformation of incident waves as they shoal, break, or surge and interact with the steep beachface. ]"

Benthic foraminifera and sand content are appropriate proxies to recognise human disturbance. Recently regenerated saltmarshes present difficulties to reconcile 210 Pb dating. Regional sediment availability is fundamental for the environmental regeneration. Saltmarshes in N. Spain are expected to adapt to ongoing sea-level rise. , A multi-proxy approach based on benthic foraminifera , sand content, short-lived radioisotope activities, heavy metal concentrations and aerial photography was developed to characterise the process of human disturbance on the intensely impacted eastern Cantabrian coast (N. Spain) over the last two centuries. Analysis of two 50 cm long sediment cores from different saltmarshes in the Santoña estuary and their comparison with previous results in nearby coastal areas defines criteria to identify records of agricultural activities in salt-marsh sediments. Agricultural occupation of saltmarshes and the later regeneration was recognised based on foraminifera and sand content. Saltmarshes in the eastern Cantabrian coast are expected to adapt to ongoing sea-level rise based on the high sedimentation rates (14–18 mm yr −1 ) observed during the regeneration process of previously reclaimed areas. These findings can potentially be useful in other temperate saltmarshes with abundant sediment input, as a cost-effective adaptation measure to counteract the effects of sea-level rise. ]"

Local authorities and managers use them in elaborating rescue and urbanism plans, which do not always work, highlighting society's vulnerability in the particular context of global environmental and climate changes. Within this context, the United Nations (Sendai, 2015) advised to construct a series of indicators to better cope with human losses and economic disasters. Actually, the question is whether or not such indicators do constitute successful decision-making tools. In this article, we critically reviewed the recent literature (from 2013 to 2017) using the Web of Science database of Clarivate Analytics to assess how indicators are currently being constructed in risk management, with a focus on risks of inundations, coastal and seismic risks. This task allowed us to discuss the spatial and temporal scale at which indicators of risk management can be applicable, to what extent they should be physically oriented and if they can fit the needs of governance framework. Based on our findings, we suggest further work on a new series of less descriptive, more dynamic and more user-friendly indicators. Finally, we encourage the dire need for continuous work to overcome the misinterpretation of used indicators and how to reduce the communication gap between the scientific community, decision makers, managers and the population. ]"

Although restrictions on use of legacy pollutants their concentrations are not decreasing. The national monitoring of pollutant concentrations performed currently is inconsistent. The amount of information needed to perform a reliable environmental assessment is too small. , Coastal marine areas of densely populated countries are exposed to a wide array of human activities having an impact on their ecological status. The Baltic Sea is particularly susceptible to pollution by hazardous substances (limited water exchange, shallowness, and large catchment area). Polish media regularly reports ecological catastrophes in the Gulf of Gdańsk area caused by eg. shipwrecks leaking. Thus, there is a need of a broad scientific based report on recent contaminant loads and distribution. In this review paper, we report loads of contaminants from different obvious and non-obvious sources. We also gather data on legacy and new emerging contaminant concentrations measured in the Gulf of Gdańsk within the last decade (2008–2018).

The edge cliffing, nonetheless, is also an inherent aspect of salt marsh development in many northwest European tidal marshes. Quite a few geomorphologists in the earlier half of the past century recognized such edge erosion as a definite repetitive stage within an autocyclic mode of marsh growth. A shift in research priorities during the past decades (primarily because of coastal management concerns, however) has resulted in an enhanced focus on sediment-flux measurement campaigns on salt marshes. This, somewhat “object-oriented” strategy hindered any further development of the once-established autocyclic growth concept, which virtually has gone into oblivion in recent times. This work makes an attempt to resurrect the notion of autocyclicity by employing its premises to address edge erosion in tidal marshes. Through a review of intertidal morphosedimentology the underlying framework for autocyclicity is envisaged. The phenomenon is demonstrated in the Holocene salt marsh plain of Moricambe basin in NW England that displays several distinct phases of marsh retreat in the form of abandoned clifflets. The suite of abandoned shorelines and terraces has been identified in detailed field mapping that followed analysis of topographic maps and aerial photographs. Vertical trends in marsh plain sediments are recorded in trenches for signs of past marsh front movements. The characteristic sea level history of the area offers an opportunity to differentiate the morphodynamic variability induced in the autocyclic growth of the marsh plain in scenarios of rising and falling sea level and the accompanied change in sediment budget. The ideas gathered are incorporated to construct a conceptual model that links temporal extent of marsh erosion to inner tidal flat sediment budget and sea level tendency. The review leads to recognition of the necessity of adopting an holistic approach in the morphodynamic investigations where marshes should be treated as a component within the “marsh–mudflat system” as each element apparently modulates evolution of the other, with an eventual linkage to subtidal channels. ]"

WRF overestimates wind magnitude in the coastal area and underestimates it in the open sea. The model provides relatively good simulations of temporal scales greater than the diurnal. Higher horizontal resolution does not significantly improve the results of the model. The ERA-Interim-forced simulations had the best results. , The winds that affect the surface of the ocean are also important for a vast array of activities, either operational or scientific, hence the importance of being able to adequately predict this quality. Because of the preceding fact, a Weather Research and Forecasting model was used to perform simulations at the surface of the Ocean, for winds derived from different boundary conditions (NCEP-CFSR, ERA-Interim and NCEP-FNL) and configured with different spatial resolution (25, 5 and 1 km), with the objective of evaluating which of these data sets delivers the more precise wind simulation at the surface of the ocean. A comparative analysis was performed between the different outputs of the WRF model, QuikSCAT satellite and in situ observations of a buoy installed off the central coast of Chile. The results showed that the WRF model, overestimates the wind magnitudes, across all boundary conditions or spatial resolution. Additionally, depending on the in situ wind magnitude (&gt;6 ms −1 ), the model predicts adequately wind magnitude and direction. Spatial comparisons were performed between QuikSCAT and WRF outputs at the Chilean coast to evaluate any possible differences. The modeled winds showed a tendency to be stronger than those measured by Satellites and the bigger differences appeared closer to the shore. The wavelet coherence and phase analysis, confirmed that the model delivers precise wind information for frequencies greater than the daily cycle. Finally, the results of the simulation produced by the ERA-Interim analysis showed lower errors in terms of temporal and spatial variability of surface winds. ]"

Seasonal circulation patterns have been newly constructed from drifter trajectories. Kuroshio branching southwest of Kyushu is evident in composite drifter trajectories. Coastal currents on the shelf experience significant change from winter to summer. , We investigated seasonal circulation patterns of the Yellow and East China Seas (YECS), by reviewing previous works on the circulation and its dominant currents, and taking into account newly-compiled trajectories of satellite-tracked drifters collected between the 1980s and 2000s. The circulation patterns suggested before the 1990s can be categorized into two groups, depending on the identified origin of the Tsushima Warm Current in the Korea-Tsushima Straits: (i) branching from the Kuroshio southwest of Kyushu, or (ii) northeastward continuation of the Taiwan Strait throughflow . The branching of the Kuroshio southwest of Kyushu and northeast of Taiwan was clearly evidenced by current measurements and concurrent hydrographic surveys . However, there is still no clear evidence for the northeastward pathway of Taiwan Strait throughflow across the mid-shelf area of the East China Sea. Target-oriented surveys in the 1990s and 2000s employing advanced instruments, such as drifter tracking and acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements, now provide decisive proof of the clockwise rounding of the Cheju Warm Current around Jeju-do throughout the year, of the northeastward extension of Changjiang discharge in summer, and of the presence of the Yellow Sea Warm Current only in winter. Thus, both coastal currents in shallow water and secondary branch currents of the Kuroshio (such as the Yellow Sea Warm Current) are found to significantly change from winter to summer. To better present the basic pattern of YECS circulation and its seasonality , we have constructed seasonal circulations patterns, based on review results, on the newly-compiled drifter trajectories, and on hydrographic observations. Further investigations should be carried out in future, with support of comprehensive current measurements on shelf areas and through elaborate numerical modeling. ]"

An initial transient positive anomaly was observed in both adjusted sea level and SST during May–June 1997, followed by anomalously high coastal sea levels, generally strongest during September 1997 through February 1998 and abruptly returned to normal in late February 1998, and by positive temperatures anomalies over the mid-shelf that persisted longer, into April 1998. Low-frequency coastal sea-level anomalies propagated poleward at 2.1 m/s. Poleward flow over the shelf and slope was enhanced at most depths during the El Niño, compared with following years. Northward currents in the upper 12 m over the continental shelf off Newport, Oregon averaged 13.7 cm/s stronger during August 1997 through February 1998 than during the same period the following year. Enhanced poleward flow was present at all latitudes sampled during November 1997 and February 1998, particularly over the continental slope. These transects also provided clear views of a fall/winter equatorward undercurrent, which was both strongest and had the most alongshore similarity of form, during the ENSO. Finally, subsurface-intensified anticyclonic eddies originating in the poleward undercurrent appear to be a recurrent feature of the circulation off Newport late in the upwelling season. ]"

Our monitoring in 1997 showed that coastal upwelling was initiated in April, the usual time. However, a series of southwesterly storms in May and June 1997 led to a prolonged warming event and reductions in copepod biomass. Though El Niño-driven atmospheric teleconnections might have been responsible for these storms, the coastal ecosystem returned to normal with the resumption of coastal upwelling in mid-July 1997. A downwelling event began on 20 August 1997 resulting in onshore movement of offshore waters. This event appeared to mark the passage of the first Kelvin wave. At this time the shelf became flooded with low-nutrient waters and offshore, ‘warm-water’ copepod species were transported shoreward. The abundance of local endemic boreal neritic copepod species was reduced greatly, presumably because they were transported out of the system and to the north as a result of the strong poleward flows. Poleward flows strengthened during autumn, and the ocean off Oregon remained anomalously warm through the winter of 1997, spring, and early summer of 1998. Species composition of the coastal copepod assemblage remained anomalous for about a year; species with offshore and subtropical affinities dominated from late August 1997 through late July 1998. During this same period, nitrate concentrations were reduced by a factor of 4.5 (11-month mean of 1.5 μM for August 1997–July 1998 versus 6.9 μM for August 1998–July 1999), copepod biomass was reduced by a factor of 2.1 (4.9 μg carbon l −1 versus 10.5 for the same time periods), but chlorophyll concentrations were similar (2.0 versus 2.5 μg l −1 ). Perhaps the most dramatic effect on copepods during the El Niño period was the nearly complete disappearance of the normally dominant boreal neritic copepod species ( Pseudocalanus mimus , Calanus marshallae and Acartia longiremis ) and their replacement by subtropical species such as Calanus pacificus , Paracalanus parvus , Ctenocalanus vanus , Corycaeus anglicus and several species of Clausocalanus . These species persisted in the coastal waters through the end of 1998. Although most of the subarctic species began to increase in numbers in August 1998, the impact of the El Niño on Pseudocalanus mimus , normally the numerical dominant in coastal waters, was longer lasting. The P. mimus population did not recover to normal abundance levels until summer of 1999. ]"

Sea level fluctuations and climate changes have controlled peat accumulation since Late Pleistocene. Faster accumulation rates of peatlands in Southeast Asia are reported in the wetter Holocene epoch. Degradation and poor management of the Southeast Asian peatlands accelerated carbon emission between 2011 and 2018. , Peatlands are important carbon sinks, therefore their degradation mainly due to lowering of the water table, has an adverse effect to the carbon cycle and largely burden the atmosphere. Annually, extensive areas of these peatlands are affected by wildfires, therefore large peatland areas have been degraded, directly or indirectly related to anthropogenic activities, largely contributing to greenhouse gas emissions . Some of the most pristine tropical peatlands worldwide occur primarily at the coastal lowlands of Southeast Asia. In terms of their geological features and evolution, these sites are generally understudied despite covering more than half of the global area of tropical peatlands. This review compiles geological data from 52 peatlands from insular and continental Southeast Asia, providing a comprehensive geological dataset for future research. The Southeast Asian peatlands are mostly ombrogenous and hence poorly supplied by nutrients. During the Last Glacial Period ( ca. 115,000–11,000 years ago), extensive areas were exposed because of the lowering of the seawater level, which caused a consequent lowering of the groundwater table landwards; the forests were under severe threat, mainly due to dry conditions, thus resulting in the retreat of the forest boundaries inland. This was an unfavourable environment for peatland formation and hence, most of the Southeast Asian peatlands were formed right after that period. Almost 40% of the reviewed sites are located on Borneo Island, highlighting the importance of Bornean peatlands, where many peatlands are already deforested and drained and converted to plantations. Overall, the available geological data from the Southeast Asian peatlands is incomplete and non-comparable to each other because each study has a different focus. Details, such as the type of peat-forming plants, age of peat , peat thickness, substrate type and the pH value are not reported systematically in approximately 30% of the reviewed sites, while other important geological data, such as the ash yield and the carbon content of peat are only reported in 30% and 10% of the reviewed sites, respectively. Characterisation of peatlands using data imputation and principal component analysis (PCA) is based on three physical parameters (maximum ash yield, maximum thickness and oldest age), and includes the study of their relation in terms of climatic periods, peatland type, region and substrate. It is observed that peatlands which were developed in warming periods share similar physical parameters (such as accumulation rates, ash yield, peatland type, and environment of the substrates). With better data reporting on these parameters, the PCA analysis can provide a more accurate reflection of peatland characteristics and their relationships. The study aims to raise awareness on the importance and vulnerability of the Southeast Asian peatlands and to highlight their role in the global climate fluctuations. ]"

Northward flowing waters have impact on Arctic productivity at all trophic levels . Arctic &amp; Antarctic benthos , zooplankton &amp; fish have contrasting evolutionary histories. Subpolar &amp; polar fish, seabirds and marine mammals depend on advection of zooplankton. Climate change will affect polar marine ecosystem structure, function &amp; connectivity. , We compare and contrast the ecological impacts of atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns on polar and sub-polar marine ecosystems. Circulation patterns differ strikingly between the north and south. Meridional circulation in the north provides connections between the sub-Arctic and Arctic despite the presence of encircling continental landmasses, whereas annular circulation patterns in the south tend to isolate Antarctic surface waters from those in the north. These differences influence fundamental aspects of the polar ecosystems from the amount, thickness and duration of sea ice, to the types of organisms, and the ecology of zooplankton, fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Meridional flows in both the North Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans transport heat, nutrients, and plankton northward into the Chukchi Sea, the Barents Sea, and the seas off the west coast of Greenland. In the North Atlantic, the advected heat warms the waters of the southern Barents Sea and, with advected nutrients and plankton, supports immense biomasses of fish, seabirds and marine mammals. On the Pacific side of the Arctic, cold waters flowing northward across the northern Bering and Chukchi seas during winter and spring limit the ability of boreal fish species to take advantage of high seasonal production there. Southward flow of cold Arctic waters into sub-Arctic regions of the North Atlantic occurs mainly through Fram Strait with less through the Barents Sea and the Canadian Archipelago. In the Pacific, the transport of Arctic waters and plankton southward through Bering Strait is minimal. In the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its associated fronts are barriers to the southward dispersal of plankton and pelagic fishes from sub-Antarctic waters, with the consequent evolution of Antarctic zooplankton and fish species largely occurring in isolation from those to the north. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current also disperses biota throughout the Southern Ocean, and as a result, the biota tends to be similar within a given broad latitudinal band. South of the Southern Boundary of the ACC, there is a large-scale divergence that brings nutrient-rich water to the surface. This divergence, along with more localized upwelling regions and deep vertical convection in winter, generates elevated nutrient levels throughout the Antarctic at the end of austral winter. However, such elevated nutrient levels do not support elevated phytoplankton productivity through the entire Southern Ocean, as iron concentrations are rapidly removed to limiting levels by spring blooms in deep waters. However, coastal regions, with the upward mixing of iron, maintain greatly enhanced rates of production, especially in coastal polynyas. In these coastal areas, elevated primary production supports large biomasses of zooplankton, fish, seabirds, and mammals. As climate warming affects these advective processes and their heat content, there will likely be major changes in the distribution and abundance of polar biota, in particular the biota dependent on sea ice. ]"

These methods are differently well suited for assessing Biological Quality Elements (BQEs). eDNA is well suited for assessing the fish fauna. Remaining challenges for all BQEs include the modification of assessment indices and completing barcode libraries. Methods are least suited for BQEs that are surveyed rather than sampled (e.g. macrophytes). , Assessment of ecological status for the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is based on “Biological Quality Elements” (BQEs), namely phytoplankton , benthic flora, benthic invertebrates and fish. Morphological identification of these organisms is a time-consuming and expensive procedure. Here, we assess the options for complementing and, perhaps, replacing morphological identification with procedures using eDNA, metabarcoding or similar approaches. We rate the applicability of DNA-based identification for the individual BQEs and water categories (rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters) against eleven criteria, summarised under the headlines representativeness (for example suitability of current sampling methods for DNA-based identification, errors from DNA-based species detection), sensitivity (for example capability to detect sensitive taxa, unassigned reads), precision of DNA-based identification (knowledge about uncertainty), comparability with conventional approaches (for example sensitivity of metrics to differences in DNA-based identification), cost effectiveness and environmental impact. Overall, suitability of DNA-based identification is particularly high for fish, as eDNA is a well-suited sampling approach which can replace expensive and potentially harmful methods such as gill-netting, trawling or electrofishing . Furthermore, there are attempts to replace absolute by relative abundance in metric calculations. For invertebrates and phytobenthos , the main challenges include the modification of indices and completing barcode libraries. For phytoplankton, the barcode libraries are even more problematic, due to the high taxonomic diversity in plankton samples. If current assessment concepts are kept, DNA-based identification is least appropriate for macrophytes (rivers, lakes) and angiosperms/macroalgae (transitional and coastal waters), which are surveyed rather than sampled. We discuss general implications of implementing DNA-based identification into standard ecological assessment , in particular considering any adaptations to the WFD that may be required to facilitate the transition to molecular data. ]"

The experience from other countries, as well as the progress made in the state of the art for assessment of tsunami hazard, vulnerability, exposure and risk are also summarized. In addition, extensive new warning systems enabling a rapid assessment of the potential coastal impact of a tsunami have been developed and implemented. However, the experience from the tsunami events in October 2010 in Indonesia and March 2011 in Japan clearly demonstrated that the tsunami risk mitigation measures implemented to date are far from adequate.

In this regard, societal awareness and behavioural response to tsunamis are addressed. Recommendations about how the improved knowledge about tsunami hazard, vulnerability and exposure assessment gained over the past decade could be better implemented into tsunami risk reduction measures are provided at the end of the article. ]"

The research includes geochemical analysis, TOC content and GC-MS. Palaeoenvironmental conditions based on geochemical data and palynofacies are discussed. , A palynological and organic geochemical study of the Upper Cretaceous deposits cropping out in the southwestern part of the Transylvanian Basin (Petreşti section) has been carried out. The samples were collected from the marine Bozeş as well as from the overlying continental Sebeş formations, with main focus on the Bozeș Formation. The recovered palynomorph assemblages are represented mainly by early angiosperm pollen and by fern spores. Phytoplankton taxa are either absent or were recorded only as rare occurrences in the upper part of the Bozeş Formation. The identified terrestrial palynomorph assemblages document the co-occurrence of taxa from plant communities typical for fluvial to coastal habitats with other palynofloral elements derived from areas of higher altitude and/or cooler–wetter conditions. The occurrence of a diversified Normapolles assemblage including Trudopollis cuneolis, Oculopollis principalis and O. praedicatus , in association with fern spores such as Klukisporites pseudoreticulatus and Vadaszisporites sacali , supports a mid-late Campanian age for the analyzed section of the marine Bozeş Formation. Palynofacies constituents, combined with organic geochemical data, were used to reconstruct the depositional environments represented in the studied deposits. According to these data, the lower and middle sections of the Bozeş Formation sampled in the Petrești succession were deposited in a distal, outer neritic area of the Late Cretaceous basin. This outer neritic succession is followed by a nearshore/inner neritic sequence corresponding to the topmost part of the Bozeş Formation, as indicated by the presence of a palynofacies containing lath-shaped opaque phytoclasts mixed with large translucent biostructured phytoclasts. ]"

The land-ocean interface is however extremely heterogeneous in terms of terrigenous input, marine primary productivity, sediment transport processes and depositional conditions (e.g. such as bottom water oxygen level). Continental margins are also highly dynamic, with processes occurring over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. The rates of OC burial and oxidation are consequently variable over both space and time, hindering our ability to derive a global picture of OC cycling at the land-ocean interface. Here, we review the processes controlling the fate of organic matter in continental margin sediments, with a special emphasis on “hot spots” and “hot moments” of OC burial and oxidation. We present a compilation of compositional data from a set of illustrative settings, including fjords , small mountainous river margins, large deltaic systems and upwelling areas. Bulk OC stable isotope and radiocarbon compositions reveal the diversity and complexity characteristic of OC buried in marginal seas . This primarily relates to differences in marine and terrestrial inputs, the composition of the terrestrial component (e.g. vascular plant OC, soil, and petrogenic OC inputs), and processes modulating the fate of OC within the marine environment (e.g. priming). This widely contrasting behavior of OC among these systems illustrates that the reactivity of OC is a product of its chemical composition and regional conditions. Interpreted in the context of bulk compositional data as well as that obtained on specific molecular markers (e.g. lignin-derived phenols), the possibility exists to tease apart complex mixtures of terrestrial and marine inputs, and to shed light on the role of the myriad of depositional and post-depositional processes. Finally, we discuss a set of hot topics that warrant further investigation – such as the role of photochemistry , fungi, halogenation and reactive iron in dictating the fate of OC in the (changing) coastal ocean. ]"

There was not enough policy and scientific support for the industry in the past. Pearl oyster cultivation brought benefits to the urbanized coastal city, Hong Kong. Suggestions are made for the revitalization of the pearl oyster culture industry. , Pearl farming is part of Hong Kong’s maritime heritage. Its history in the territory can be traced back irregularly for over a millennium, focussed on what was then known as the Tai Po Sea ( now Tolo Harbour ( Tolo Gang ( )). For a short period in the 10th century AD Southern Han ( , during the turbulent Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period ( ), the pearl farming became a tightly guarded Imperial monopoly. Thereafter the detail is uncertain but pearl fishing would seem to have continued, if not on a large scale, until the British annexation of the New Territories in 1898, although the centre of gravity , focussed on edible oysters, had moved to Deep Bay. An attempt was made to begin a cultivated pearl industry in Tolo Harbour in the 1960s but it failed. In this paper we seek to reconstruct the history of that episode and reveal the reasons why the ventures failed based on interviews with participants, newspaper clippings, government records and records kept by the Hong Kong Heritage Project. Despite government support, key failings were an inability to find the way to cultivate oysters in Hong Kong and a deficiency of wild pearl oysters available for grafting. Based on this historical lesson, the feasibility of revitalizing the pearl cultivation industry in highly urbanized coastal cities like Hong Kong, including improvements to water quality via biofiltration , are evaluated and discussed. Some recommendations are made for enabling the industry to be viable and sustainable. ]"

Geomorphology 105, 6–17 (this volume)] shows that the number of publications on aeolian topics has increased exponentially from the mid-20th Century with approximately 50 publications per year to about 500 publications per year when the first ICAR was held, to almost 1000 publications per year currently. Areas of focus have shifted historically from initial concerns with aeolian erosion and dust events as isolated phenomenon of localized curiosity or only regional importance, to comprehensive physically-based investigations and modeling of the mechanics of aeolian transport. Recently, more applied studies have been motivated by the recognition of the importance of aeolian processes to dust emissions into the atmosphere (with relevance for human health and for meteorological conditions and climate change) and within regional management contexts (especially on coasts where impending sea-level rise is of great concern and in arid and semi-arid environments given the dependence of sediment surface stability and remobilization on meteorological and ecological conditions). Aeolian geomorphology is a rapidly growing sub-discipline of Geomorphology that offers rich opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations with colleagues from the Atmospheric Sciences, Climatology, Sedimentology, Quaternary Geology, Fluid Mechanics, Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Physical Geography, Ecology, and Agricultural Sciences, as well as our counterparts in fluvial, coastal, and arid-lands geomorphology who are similarly concerned with fluid-sediment interactions and the consequent genesis of landforms. ]"

The post-Cenomanian uplift caused an inversion of Cretaceous basins and generated a landscape in which the most elevated landforms correspond either to resistant post-rift sedimentary cover, or to residuals of Cretaceous rift shoulders, above a low erosion surface. Since no evidence of a former post-Cenomanian sedimentary cover of significant thickness was found outside the coastal fringe, we could evaluate the uplift to 600 m at most and the mean erosion rates to 10 m/Ma or less. However, according to models based upon the results of thermochronological analyses (apatite fission tracks analysis-AFTA), two slices of 1000 m to 2500 m would have been deposited over the present pile in the south part of the study area, respectively in Campanian and Oligocene-Miocene times, before being totally removed. We examine here the diverging scenarios of geomorphic evolution respectively based upon morphostratigraphy (our model) and upon low temperature thermochronology , submitting them to available evidence provided by an updated and geographically extended review of geomorphological and sedimentological data, and trying to decipher some of the reasons that might lead to disputable geomorphic interpretations. We stress the fundamental importance of taking into account all the available results of geomorphological and geological approaches in any interpretation of thermochronological and other analytic methods used for reconstructing long-term landscape evolutions . This is one of the conditions for reinforcing the trust one can have in their results, which may bring complementary or unique information, peculiarly in places where sedimentary or volcanic markers are missing. ]"

Beagle (1831–1836) under Captain Robert FitzRoy and the United States Exploring Expedition (1838–1842) under Lieutenant Charles Wilkes. The former expedition mainly surveyed coastal South America, but also visited many volcanic islands in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. The latter expedition followed a similar path through the Atlantic, but devoted more time to Pacific Ocean islands. Remembered more today for his visit to the Galapagos Islands and its subsequent impact on understanding the mechanisms of biological evolution, Darwin was motivated early on during his stopover in the Cape Verde Islands to compile studies on the geology of volcanic islands. Better known for his theory of atoll development from the subsidence of volcanic islands stimulated by his visit to the Keeling Islands and published in 1842, Darwin also wrote a related volume published in 1844 with an equally strong emphasis on island uplift. Dana was influenced by Darwin's theory of atoll development, and published his own independent observations on coral reefs and island subsidence in 1843, 1849, and 1853. The work of both geologists matured from primary observations using inductive logic during fieldwork (i.g. unconformable position of limestone on and between basalt flows as an indicator of paleo-sea level) to the advancement of broader theories regarding the behavior of the Earth's oceanic crust . Notably, Dana recognized age differences among islands in Pacific archipelagos and was strongly influenced by the orientations of those island groups. The classic Hawaiian model that features a linear string of progressively older and subsiding islands does not apply easily to many other island groups such as the Galapagos, Azores , Canary, and Cape Verde islands. Geologists and coastal geomorphologists increasingly find that the original observations on island uplift covered in Darwin's, 1844 treatment provide an alternative pathway to understanding the complexities of island histories in oceanic settings. Original work by Darwin and Dana also led to ongoing studies on the trans-oceanic migrations of marine organisms, such as barnacles, corals and non-attached coralline red algae represented by rhodoliths. This work gives added importance to oceanic islands as way stations in the dispersal of biotas over time. ]"

The evolution of El Niño off California closely followed the pattern observed in the tropical Pacific. In June 1997 an anomalous influx of warm southerly waters, with weak signatures on coastal sea level and thermocline depth, marked the onset of El Niño in central California. The timing was consistent with propagation from the tropics via the equatorial and coastal wave-guide. By late 1997, the classical stratified ocean condition with a deep thermocline, high sea level, and warm sea surface temperature (SST) commonly associated with El Niño dominated the coastal zone. During the first half of 1998 the core of the California Current, which is normally detected several hundred kilometers from shore as a river of low salinity, low nutrient water, was hugging the coast. High nutrient, productive waters that occur in a north–south band from the coast to approximately 200 km offshore during cool years disappeared during El Niño. The nitrate in surface waters was less than 20% of normal and new production was reduced by close to 70%. The La Niña recovery phase began in the fall of 1998 when SSTs dropped below normal, and ocean productivity rebounded to higher than normal levels. The reduction in coastal California primary productivity associated with El Niño was estimated to be 50 million metric tons of carbon (5 × 10 13 g C). (5 × 10 13 g C). This reduction certainly had deleterious effects on zooplankton, fish, and marine mammals. The 1992–1993 El Niño was more moderate than the 1997–1998 event, but because its duration was longer, its overall chemical and biological impact may have been comparable. How strongly the ecosystem responds to El Niño appears related to the longer-term background climatic state of the Pacific Ocean. The 1982–1983 and 1992–1993 El Niños occurred during the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO may have changed sign during the 1997–1998 El Niño, resulting in weaker ecological effects than would otherwise have been predicted based on the strength of the temperature anomaly. ]"

The inundation model is used to explore the general conditions under which fringing reefs act as coastal buffers against incoming tsunamis. Of particular interest is the response of tsunamis to reefs of varying widths, depths, and roughness, as well as the effects of channels incised in the reef and the focusing effect of embayments. Model simulations for conditions similar to Tutuila, yet simplified to be uniform in the alongshore, suggest that for narrow reefs, less than about 200 m wide, the shoaling owing to shallow water depths over the fringing reef dominates, inducing greater wave heights onshore under some conditions and farther inundation inland. As the reef width increases, wave dissipation through bottom friction begins to dominate and the reef causes the tsunami wave heights to decrease and the tsunami to inundate less far inland. A sensitivity analysis suggests that coral reef roughness is important in determining the manner in which a fringing reef affects tsunami inundation. Smooth reefs are more likely to increase the onshore velocity within the tsunami compared to rough reefs. A larger velocity will likely result in an increased impact of the tsunami on structures and buildings. Simulations developed to explore 2D coastal morphology show that incised channels similar to those found around Tutuila, as well as coastal embayments, also affect tsunami inundation, allowing larger waves to penetrate farther inland. The largest effect is found for channels located within embayments, and for embayments that narrow landward. These simulations suggest that embayments that narrow landward, such as Fagafue Bay on the north side of Tutuila, and that have an incised deep channel, can cause a significant increase in tsunami wave heights, inundation distances, and velocities. Wide embayments, similar in size to Massacre Bay, induce some tsunami amplification, but not as much as for the narrowing embayment. ]"

The Summer Monsoon Current (SMC) flows eastward during the summer monsoon (May–September) and the Winter Monsoon Current (WMC) flows westward during the winter monsoon (November–February). We assemble data on ship drifts, winds and Ekman drift, and geostrophic currents derived from altimetry and hydrography to describe the observed climatological seasonal cycle of the monsoon currents. We then use an Oceanic General Circulation Model (OGCM) to simulate these currents and estimate their transports, and a 1 1 2 1 1 2 -layer reduced-gravity model to investigate the processes that force them. The monsoon currents extend over the entire basin, from the Somali coast to the eastern Bay of Bengal. They do not, however, come into being, or decay, over this entire region at a given time. Different parts of the currents form at different times, and it is only in their mature phase that the currents exist as trans-basin flows. The westward WMC first forms south of Sri Lanka in November and is fed initially by the equatorward East India Coastal Current (EICC); the westward WMC in the southern Bay appears later. In its mature phase during December–March, the WMC flows westwards across the southern Bay; it divides into two branches in the Arabian Sea. One of these branches continues flowing westwards, whereas the other turns around the Lakshadweep high (a sea-level high off southwest India) to flow into the poleward West India Coastal Current (WICC). The WMC is primarily a geostrophic current, modulated by Ekman drift. The eastward flowing SMC first appears in the southern Bay during May. In its mature phase, which peaks with the summer monsoon in July, the SMC in the Arabian Sea is a continuation of the Somali Current and the coastal current off Oman. It flows eastward and southeastward across the Arabian Sea and around the Lakshadweep low (a sea-level low off southwest India), eastward south of Sri Lanka, and into the Bay of Bengal. Strong winds during the summer monsoon ensure that Ekman drift dominates at the surface, leading to a more complex vertical structure in the SMC than in the WMC. In the depth-averaged flow over 50 m, the mature phase of the SMC lasts from May to September. The numerical experiments show that the dynamics of the north Indian Ocean on seasonal time scales can be explained by linear wave theory. The circulation at any point is decided by both local forcing and remote forcing, whose signals are carried by equatorial and coastal waves. Superimposed on the currents associated with these waves is the local Ekman drift. The geostrophic component of the monsoon currents is forced by several processes. In the Bay of Bengal, the monsoon currents are forced by Ekman pumping and by the winds in the equatorial Indian Ocean. In the eastern Arabian Sea, the major forcing mechanisms are the winds along the east and west coasts of India and Sri Lanka; these processes link the parts of the SMC in the Arabian Sea and the Bay during the summer monsoon, and of the WMC early during winter. Ekman pumping in the central Arabian Sea and off the Somali coast forces the monsoon currents in the central and western Arabian Sea, with Rossby waves radiated from the Indian west coast also playing a role. Therefore, the monsoon currents consist of several parts, each of which is forced by one or more processes, which act in concert to produce the continuous currents seen flowing across the breadth of the north Indian Ocean. ]"

If nutrient concentrations are not limiting for growth, then ratios do not influence floristic composition. At non-limiting concentrations, evidence that alteration of nitrogen: phosphorus (N:P) ratios has stimulated HABs is limited, and primarily based on hypothesised relationships in relatively few locations (in particular: Tolo Harbour Hong Kong and Dutch Coastal Waters). In all cases, an unequivocal causal link between an increase in HABs (frequency, magnitude or duration) and change in N or P as the limiting nutrient is difficult to establish. The silicon (Si) limitation hypothesis is generally supported by experimental evidence and field data on the nuisance flagellate Phaeocystis . We found little evidence that high N:Si ratios preferentially promote harmful dinoflagellates over benign species. Laboratory studies demonstrate that nutrient ratios can influence toxin production, but genus and species specific differences and environmental control make extrapolation of these data to the field difficult. Studies of the role of dissolved and particulate organic nutrients in the growth of HAB species, while limited, demonstrate the potential for organic nutrients (especially organic N) to support the growth of a range of HAB species. There is a clear need for better understanding of the role of mixotrophy in the formation of HABs and for studies of HAB and non-HAB species in competition for environmentally realistic concentrations of organic nutrients. ]"

As inferred from landslides dated to the Late Glacial and Holocene , glacial-interglacial transitions are the major intervals of enhanced landsliding, but the length of this interval varies between distinct types of landscapes. Mass movements in non-glaciated temperate mountain ranges, arid and tropical regions, and coastal areas intensified soon after the onset of the Holocene alongside the warming and wetting of the climate, whereas large rock slides in areas within the limits of Pleistocene glaciations mostly show a millennial-scale time lag with respect to glacier withdrawal. Although the incidence of landslides was ubiquitous throughout the Holocene, the mid- to late-Holocene transition (~5–4 ka) was especially favourable for the origin of landslides across distinct types of landscapes, indicating a strengthened role of mass movements during the culmination phases of interglacial climate optima. In addition, growing evidence suggests that the enhanced activity of landslides occurred during warmer interstadial conditions, which is best demonstrated in the temporal coincidence of arid-zone landslides with Quaternary “pluvials”. Future progress in the understanding of the relationships between landslides and Quaternary climate changes should benefit from the i) extension of datasets of dated landslides, ii) geographical expansion of dating studies to regions with a lack of chronologically determined landslides (e.g., tropics), iii) improvement of landslide-dating strategies involving the incorporation of independent palaeoclimatic proxies and iv) wider incorporation of numerical modeling within landslide-dating studies. ]"

However, these depositional models generally lack relevant information about sedimentary processes, transport mechanisms and controlling factors on offshore sediment redeposition , which are potential sources of information for sequence stratigraphic, palaeoclimate and exploration studies. Several examples from the Neogene Betic basins of the western Mediterranean region have been selected to integrate the processes and controlling factors on the offshore sediment transport and the resulting deposits. Additional published data from other Mediterranean localities have also been considered. An idealized model of temperate-water carbonate deposition in the study examples comprises a shallow-water coastal belt and a shoal area developed landwards of a carbonate-factory zone, and deeper-water outer-ramp, slope, and basin settings below the storm wave base. The environments off the factory bear a variety of remobilized deposits characterized by distinctive features. These deposits include storm shell beds, sediment gravity flows (debrites and turbidites), bed packages with hummocky and swaley cross-stratification (HCS and SCS), slope sandwaves, and channel as well as lobe deposits. The different types of redeposited facies resulted from various offshore sediment-transport processes interacting with the local conditions. Storm shell beds developed in low-energy protected basins, regardless of the ramp profile. Debrites and turbidites formed in the distal parts of moderately-steep ramps within moderately energetic hydrodynamic contexts. Similar gradients but with higher hydrodynamic energy and appropriate sediment grain size favoured the formation of deposits with HCS and SCS in relatively deep-water settings. The circulation pattern of currents within the basin was the main factor controlling the formation of downslope migrating sandwaves. In the case of channel and lobe deposits, hydrodynamic-flow behaviour through the channels and at the transition point conditioned the features of the resulting deposits. Offshore resedimentation is consistent with a highstand shedding model in the case of storm-driven event deposits (storm beds, sediment gravity flows and deposits with HCS–SCS) while offshore directed and persistent unidirectional currents generated prograding margin clinoforms during falling and low sea levels. This review provides a concise depositional framework to understand the different redeposition processes operating in low-energy, temperate-water carbonate ramps and to interpret remobilized deposits in low-energy regions such as the Mediterranean Sea. ]"

Inundation of the Sendai Plain and the offshore wave sources of both tsunamis are compared. The Jogan tsunami deposit is ubiquitous on the coastal plains of Sendai Bay, whereas, to date, it is only identified in a few locations along the Sanriku and Joban Coasts. This resulted in an underprediction of the size of the wave source of the Tohoku-oki tsunami. The inland boundary of the inundation area of the Tohoku-oki tsunami on the Sendai Plain is approximately equivalent to that of the Jogan tsunami, although many sedimentological and geomorphologic factors make a direct comparison of the tsunamis complicated and difficult. The magnitude of the Jogan earthquake (Mw = 8.4), which was derived from the tsunami deposit inland extent and numerical inundation modeling, was too small to predict the magnitude of the Tohoku-oki earthquake (Mw = 9.0–9.1) and tsunami. Additional research is needed to improve deposit-based estimates of the magnitudes of past tsunamis and to increase the ability to use tsunami deposits, in conjunction with inundation modeling, to assess future tsunami hazards. ]"

Central to the successful operation of limited area model applications are the inclusion of a comprehensive suite of open boundary conditions, turbulence closure and vertical discretization. The open boundary problem, in particular, is considered and we present the open boundary condition implementation and performance in limited area model configurations corresponding to three realistic test cases. These tests represent typical configurations the physical oceanographer may encounter, and consist of (1) a coastal shelf model application where a two-tiered model configuration is used for down-scaling from a coarse grid model to supply sufficiently resolved boundary values for active cross-shelf open boundaries of a regional model; (2) tidal response of a gulf with one open boundary across the mouth of the gulf; (3) response of a coastal region to the passage of a tropical cyclone , where the open boundaries behave in primarily a passive capacity. Although the code base used in the test cases is MOM4p1, emphasis is placed on general features of the tests that are necessary for the scientific and operational use of any limited area model, hence key findings may be applied to limited area models in general. ]"

Phyto- and zooplankton in the estuaries form important components of the pelagic food webs that participate in producing and structuring the matter, energy, and information fluxes in the ecosystems. Due to salinity gradients, estuaries provide a large variety of aquatic habitats for native populations of marine, brackish and fresh water plankton species. Non-indigenous planktonic species that expand their bio-geographical range and invade the Baltic coastal ecosystems also find favourable environments, establish permanent populations there, and impact aboriginal ecosystems. The dynamics of abundance, species diversity, population structure, productivity of planktonic communities, and peculiarities of trophic interactions in different Baltic estuaries are influenced by a number of common environmental factors. Being measured on the unified basis and monitored, changes (or stability) of structural and functional parameters of plankton communities can serve as indicators of alterations to the ecosystems. Comparative analyses and quantitative estimates of long-term changes in phyto- and zooplankton can contribute to evaluation of functional response of Baltic coastal ecosystems to anthropogenic stress. Both theoretical (modeling) and empirical studies of interactions within plankton communities aimed at the assessment of the role of planktonic organisms in water quality regulation, and applicability of these data for the evaluation of the status of ecosystems and their management can be considered as major goals for the future investigations in Baltic estuaries. ]"

Climate change can lead to reductions in seafood macro and micronutrients. The effects of environmental change on seafood nutritional and sensory quality is species-specific. We develop a framework for evaluating the confidence in assessments of species nutritional quality to climate-driven environmental change. , Climate change is impacting living marine resources , whilst concomitantly, global reliance on seafood as a source of nutrition is increasing. Here we review an emerging research frontier, identifying significant impacts of climate-driven environmental change on the nutritional and sensory quality of seafood, and implications for human health. We highlight that changing ocean temperature, pH and salinity can lead to reductions in seafood macro and micronutrients, including essential nutrients such as protein and lipids. However, the nutritional quality of seafood appears to be more resilient in taxa that inhabit naturally variable environments such as estuaries and shallow near-coastal habitats. We develop criteria for assessing confidence in categorising the nutritional quality of seafood as vulnerable or resilient to climate change. The application of this criteria to a subset of seafood nutritional studies demonstrates confidence levels are generally low and could be improved by more realistic experimental designs and research collaboration. We highlight knowledge gaps to guide future research in this emerging field. ]"

These rocks include granitoids and rhyolites , and minor mafic and rare intermediate igneous rocks, of unclear geodynamic origins. We compiled 780 published igneous rock ages to age-code a 1:500, 000 digital geological map, which was then used to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of the associated magmatism . Regional igneous rocks can be divided into four major emplacement episodes: 190–175 Ma , 165–155 Ma , 145–125 Ma , and 105–95 Ma , with the first two episodes dominated by intrusive rocks emplaced in the Jurassic in inland South China (~550–1200 km away from the trench), and the latter two episodes mostly eruptive rocks emplaced in the Cretaceous along coastal areas (~400–800 km away from the trench). To investigate the association of these events with the history of subduction , we calculated the slab flux along eastern China using two published global plate tectonic reconstructions. We found that the slab flux (per kilometer) between ~145 Ma and 120 Ma along eastern China was up to 0.018 km 2 /yr, which is much larger than the global average for the last 200 Myr (0.005 km 2 /yr); this period of large slab flux largely coincides with Early Cretaceous magmatism in the region. Combined with the geochemical characteristics of these rocks, we propose that Cretaceous magmatism in South China was related to underplating caused by dehydration of the subducting Izanagi slab. In contrast, the slab flux was much lower (0.003–0.007 km 2 /yr) during the period of Jurassic magmatism. We used the two considered plate reconstructions to drive three mantle flow models, which predict that upper mantle upwellings occurred beneath the SCB in the Jurassic, triggered by subducting slabs. A hydrous mantle transition zone, which could have developed due to long-term subduction around the SCB, is likely to have facilitated these mantle upwellings and caused partial mantle melting. We propose that these mantle upwellings and associated hydrous melting, could have caused the melting of continental crust and induced Jurassic intraplate magmatism in the SCB. ]"

Coastal polynyas are generally highly productive, which can lead to substantial CO 2 drawdown. Consequently, they are important sink regions for atmospheric CO 2 . Depending on the surface area, the timing, duration and other factors, large differences exist as to the importance of polynyas in a biogeochemical sense. In the Arctic, the North Water Polynya seems to be the most important one, while in the Antarctic the most important is the Ross Sea Polynya. Polynyas in the Arctic have been better investigated and therefore the important polynyas are described with some confidence as to accuracy and completeness. For the Antarctic, this only holds for the Ross Sea Polynya. For many other Antarctic polynyas, only incomplete information is available. This is true even for the large, well known Weddell Polynya of the 1970s, which represents one of the few open-ocean polynyas. Here its biogeochemical role is semi-quantitatively assessed by combining the physical data from the 1970s with the known distributions of biogeochemical properties from recent years. It is deduced that the Weddell Polynya was a significant one-time sink for anthropogenic CO 2 and CFCs, with ensuing deep-sea sequestration. Notably, some coastal polynyas are instrumental in transferring anthropogenic CO 2 from the ice-free shelves to the abyssal oceans. ]"

This is due to the huge suspended-sediment discharge of the Amazon River (10 6 × 754 tons yr − 1 ± 9%), part of which is transported alongshore as mud banks. Mud-bank formation is controlled by the physical oceanography of the continental shelf seaward of the Amazon River mouth, an initial seafloor storage area for much of the suspended sediment discharged from the river. In this area, rapid and sustained fluid-mud concentration and trapping are associated with fresh water–salt water interaction and estuarine front activity on the shelf due to the enormous Amazon water discharge (ca. 173,000 m 3 s − 1 at Obidos, 900 km upstream of the mouth). Fluid mud is transported shoreward and then along the coasts of the Guianas by a complex interaction of wave and tidal forcing, and wind-generated coastal currents. The mud banks, which may number up to 15 or more at any time, are up to 5 m-thick, 10 to 60 km-long, and 20 to 30 km-wide, and each may contain the equivalent mass of the annual mud supply of the Amazon. As the banks migrate alongshore, their interaction with waves results in complex and markedly fluctuating shorelines that are associated with space- and time-varying depositional ‘bank’ phases and erosional ‘inter-bank’ phases. Bank zones are protected from wave attack as a result of wave-energy dampening by mud, and undergo significant, albeit temporary, coastal accretion accompanied by rapid mangrove colonization. The dampening of waves in bank areas as they propagate onshore is accompanied by the shoreward recycling of mud, commonly in the form of individual mud bars. These bars progressively undergo desiccation and consolidation, and thus constitute a major pathway for rapid and massive colonization by mangroves. Erosion by waves propagating across relatively mud-deficient shoreface zones in inter-bank areas can lead to muddy shoreline retreat rates of tens of metres to several kilometres over a few months to a few years, accompanied by massive removal of mangroves. Notwithstanding the higher incident wave energy on inter-bank shores, inter-bank shorefaces are permanently muddy due to the pervasive influence of the Amazon muddy discharge. Inter-bank and transitional bank-to-inter-bank phases are associated with both periodic sandy chenier formation and extreme forms of rotation of rare headland-bound sandy beaches. The high mud supply from the Amazon has been the overarching geological control on the Quaternary evolution of the northeastern South American coast, having led to the growth of a muddy shelf clinoform at the mouth of the Amazon and more or less important progradation throughout this coast. Net progradation reflects an imbalance in favour of deposition during each mud-bank–inter-bank cycle. The high mud supply has presumably blanketed shelf sand deposited by smaller rivers during eustatic lowstand phases. The shelf clinoform structure at the mouth of the Amazon and the muddy coastal progradation throughout the coast of the Guianas and into Venezuela provide analogues of the geological record on muddy shorefaces. ]"

The Schmidt hammer measures the hardness or strength of a rock surface by means of R-values (rebound values), which are produced as the hammer impacts the surface. Age calibration is carried out with reference to at least two surfaces of known age (control surfaces). Mean R-values then yield numerical estimates of the time elapsed since exposure of rock surfaces to subaerial weathering. Under favourable circumstances with a sufficiently large number of impacts, SHD has an age resolution of 300–500 years for rock surfaces exposed during the Holocene and Late Pleistocene , and a current age range of ~25 ka. Accurate independent dating of control surfaces and careful selection of sites to reduce the effects of lithological variability are essential. R-value distributions are an important aid in the interpretation of SHD ages from active and relict, synchronous and diachronous, single and multiple-event surfaces. Important research applications have been made within the fields of Quaternary geochronology , palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, geomorphology and subaerial processes, and landscape dynamics. SHD has been found particularly useful in relation to boulder deposits and bedrock surfaces in glacial and periglacial environments . There is much untapped potential in coastal, temperate and tropical landscapes wherever rock surfaces are exposed to undisturbed rock weathering. The advantages and limitations of SHD compare favourably with the complementary exposure-age technique of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating (TCND). The capability to provide a large number of exposure ages at low cost, and non-destructively in sensitive natural and artefactual settings, are special strengths of SHD. ]"

In regions of high sediment discharge like the Mekong River Delta in southern Vietnam, these processes are even more significant. Three cruises in 2006, 2007 and 2008 were carried out to investigate the sediment suspension and their spatial distribution. Additionally, we investigated the influence of the tidal currents in relation to the suspended sediment. Therefore, all cruises took place during the inter-monsoon season between March and May where wave and wind influences are not dominant in contrast to the summer monsoon (May to early October) and winter monsoon season (November to early March). Suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) in the particle-size range between 2.5 and 500 μm were measured with an LISST-instrument (Laser In Situ Scattering and Transmissiometry). Current velocities and directions were recorded with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). Additionally, data of different tidal gauge stations in the Mekong River Delta were correlated and compared to the mixed semidiurnal–diurnal tidal cycle. Our results show significant areas of SSCs greater than 25 μl/l in the Mekong River branches and its subaqueous delta during the inter-monsoon season. 20% of all measured SSCs in the subaqueous Mekong Delta exceed 100 μl/l. Highest concentrations occur close to the seabed. SSCs decrease at the transition to the open shelf. The shelf region contains only low suspension loads, especially on the south-eastern shelf (99% of all samples &lt;25 μl/l). However, in the southern shelf region around Ca Mau Cape the suspension load is also higher (&gt;25 μl/l) close to the seabed in water depths of 20–25 m. Two surveys lasting 25 h each were performed on mooring stations in 12 m (Mooring 1) and 26 m (Mooring 2) water depth and located 3.2 km apart on the subaqueous delta slope. Similar patterns of SSC over time show that concentrations of suspension load correlate with the tidal current velocities. High tidal current velocities of up to 0.6 m/s near the sea bottom generate increasing SSCs of more than 25 μl/l in the water column. Additionally a significant trend of decreasing SSC from the near-seabed to the upper part of the water column can be observed. In terms of sediment transport the ebb phase dominates the tidal cycle by its higher tidal current velocities but the flood phase has the longer duration. The switch of the tidal current direction from ebb to flood phase occurs rapidly against which the change from flood to ebb phase requires up to 3 h. This leads to an asymmetry of the tidal ellipses and may cause a net-sediment transport from the shelf into the subaqueous Mekong Delta. In the subaqueous Mekong Delta and adjacent shelf, seven transects show similar patterns of SSCs dependent to the tidal phase. A hypopycnal sediment plume from the subaqueous Mekong Delta into the shelf region was not observed. Our results imply that resuspension by tidal currents dominates the sediment transport in the subaqueous Mekong Delta and adjacent shelf regions during the inter-monsoon season. ]"

Indicators are set to evaluate the success and performance of NBS projects. There is an absence of worldwide accepted and standard approaches to NBS monitoring. Combining data from ground-based techniques and remote sensing offers new opportunities to monitor NBS. NBS are complex features and monitoring their functioning requires expensive equipment. , To bring to fruition the capability of nature-based solutions (NBS) in mitigating hydro-meteorological risks (HMRs) and facilitate their widespread uptake require a consolidated knowledge-base related to their monitoring methods, efficiency, functioning and the ecosystem services they provide. We attempt to fill this knowledge gap by reviewing and compiling the existing scientific literature on methods, including ground-based measurements (e.g. gauging stations, wireless sensor network) and remote sensing observations (e.g. from topographic LiDAR, multispectral and radar sensors) that have been used and/or can be relevant to monitor the performance of NBS against five HMRs: floods, droughts, heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion . These can allow the mapping of the risks and impacts of the specific hydro-meteorological events. We found that the selection and application of monitoring methods mostly rely on the particular NBS being monitored, resource availability (e.g. time, budget, space) and type of HMRs. No standalone method currently exists that can allow monitoring the performance of NBS in its broadest view. However, equipments, tools and technologies developed for other purposes, such as for ground-based measurements and atmospheric observations , can be applied to accurately monitor the performance of NBS to mitigate HMRs. We also focused on the capabilities of passive and active remote sensing, pointing out their associated opportunities and difficulties for NBS monitoring application. We conclude that the advancement in airborne and satellite-based remote sensing technology has signified a leap in the systematic monitoring of NBS performance, as well as provided a robust way for the spatial and temporal comparison of NBS intervention versus its absence. This improved performance measurement can support the evaluation of existing uncertainty and scepticism in selecting NBS over the artificially built concrete structures or grey approaches by addressing the questions of performance precariousness. Remote sensing technical developments, however, take time to shift toward a state of operational readiness for monitoring the progress of NBS in place (e.g. green NBS growth rate, their changes and effectiveness through time). More research is required to develop a holistic approach, which could routinely and continually monitor the performance of NBS over a large scale of intervention. This performance evaluation could increase the ecological and socio-economic benefits of NBS, and also create high levels of their acceptance and confidence by overcoming potential scepticism of NBS implementations. ]"

Differing scales of mangrove ecosystem services provision and policy have posed challenges for their conservation. Mangrove conservation would benefit from understanding the complex interrelationships between social and natural systems. , Mangrove forests provide critical services around the globe to both human populations and the ecosystems they occupy.

Data from an extensive literature review and original fieldwork demonstrates that many landforms and geomorphic features of modern river systems appear in the Palaeozoic stratigraphic record once terrestrial vegetation had adopted certain evolutionary advances. For example, stable point bars are associated with the onset of rooted plants in the Siluro-Devonian and avulsive and anabranching fluvial systems become common at the same time as extensive arborescent vegetation in the Carboniferous. In this paper, we demonstrate a correlation between the diversification of physical fluvial environments and the expansion of terrestrial fauna and flora, with an emphasis on the culmination of these trends within Carboniferous alluvial systems. Many extrinsic factors have been considered as possible controls on the evolutionary timelines of terrestrialization for organisms. However, a fundamental prerequisite for achieving terrestrial biodiversity was the variety of physical habitats, especially riparian systems, available for newly evolved organisms. In association with abundant lowland meandering systems, the widespread appearance across Carboniferous alluvial plains of fixed-channel and anabranching reaches created further physical landforms for colonization and would have promoted increasingly complex hyporheic flow regimes. Furthermore the associated increase in arborescent vegetation and supply of large woody debris to inland and coastal rivers would have created a wealth of microhabitats for continental organisms. We argue that the expanding extent and diversity of physical alluvial niches during the Palaeozoic is an underappreciated driver of the terrestrialization of early continental life. The study of the deep-time fossil and stratigraphic record also illustrates that vegetation is a fundamental prerequisite for the creation of biogeomorphic alluvial landforms and physical habitats and microhabitats . ]"

Sponge meadows were alternate stable states in contrast to carbonate factories. Glass ramps were limited by silica flux and lack modern analogues. Review of Phanerozoic cases reveals sponges' environmental flexibility and ecological dominance. , Glass ramps are coastal marine sedimentation regimes of siliceous biomineralization , and present alternatives to carbonate or siliciclastic deposition. Prominent chert deposits around the world record glass ramps from the Eocene , Jurassic, Permian , and Mississippian. These events ranged from regional to continental scale, and lasted from a couple million years to over ten million years. This review compares established cases of glass ramp deposition to clarify the bio-depositional features that distinguish glass ramps from other bedded or mounded biosiliceous deposits, and from carbonate ramp regimes. It also compares environmental contexts of glass ramp initiation and persistence. The primary sediment on these glass ramps is disaggregated spicules of siliceous sponges. The sponges formed meadows on level-bottom inner- and mid-ramp settings, and loose spicules were redistributed along the shelf. Carbonate bioclasts were generally present but diluted by the great abundance of spicules. Carbonate factories were either limited to small, dense patches; moved offshore; or re-established at a later time. Glass ramps initiated in a wide variety of climates and oceanographic settings but appeared to initially require partial protection from storm energy. The importance of marine silicic acid for such widespread biosiliceous factories is also estimated, showing that glass ramps required long-term adjustments in silica supply. Glass ramps lack modern analogues, but their ecology can be interpreted in light of stable state dynamics in other modern invertebrate communities. It is suggested that siliceous sponge meadows were an alternate stable state locally on carbonate ramps, occurring with greater frequency and carrying greater ecological significance than have been previously expected. This model warrants additional scrutiny on sponge meadows' possible stabilizing feedbacks and on the thresholds of state switching. ]"

Presently, hundreds of thousands of people live in very vulnerable sites, and it seems impossible to avoid potential catastrophe, especially in the poorest neighborhoods, which are located in intermountain areas of the main valleys and in the foothills of the northern Caribbean Mountains. In these areas, urban expansion since 1950 can be traced very clearly, as the result of population growth close to the center of the main economic activities. This chapter analyzes some of the most remarkable disasters that have recently affected Venezuela. The impacts of disorganized urban growth on alluvial fans and the catastrophic flood on the north face of the Caribbean Mountains of Venezuela are presented here in historical perspective. Because of the magnitude of the event, details are offered on the disaster in 1999 at Vargas, which killed more than 15,000 people as a result of debris flows on the coastal alluvial fans. The torrential avalanche of the Limon River in the south side of the north central Caribbean Mountains and other recent human and natural disasters caused by catastrophic floods in the Venezuelan Andes are discussed. On the basis of all the disasters we have reviewed, we can conclude that the catastrophes were induced mainly by human mistakes produced by poverty and by the lack of governmental policies on territorial planning of new urban zoning.

Weathering geochronology provides the appropriate tool for testing these models. New and published 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology of 346 grains of Mn oxides extracted from weathering profiles representing four regionally recognized landsurfaces in southeastern Brazil reveals that weathering minerals record minimum ages for the surfaces hosting the weathering profiles . Weathering profiles at the highest elevation surfaces are as old as ~70 Ma; those at intermediate surfaces formed post ~13 Ma; incipient profiles at incised valleys range from ~4–1 Ma; and the shallowest and least evolved weathering profiles at coastal plains yield ~1.0–0.8 Ma ages. The oldest and highest elevation landsurfaces are blanketed by deep (&gt;150 m) chemically stratified lateritic profiles; intermediate surfaces host deep saprolites (ca. 40–60 m) capped by regional stone lines; and shallow (5–20 m) and young weathering profiles cover the more deeply dissected parts of the landscape within intracontinental valleys and along the coastal plains. The hierarchy in ages and elevations for the weathering profiles suggests that the landscape in southeastern Brazil evolved through alternation of weathering-prone periods interrupted by periods of uplift and widespread incision. The denudation chronology model derived from weathering geochronology is compatible with the sedimentary record in adjacent offshore sedimentary basins . It is also compatible with erosion rates measured by cosmogenic isotopes for each of the separate landsurfaces.

During this period: (1) the highest subsurface temperature anomalies coincided with subsurface nutrient anomaly minima at the depth of the pycnocline; (2) southern saline and nutrient-poor waters occupied the upper 80 dbar of the water column along the entire section; and (3) nitrate levels were close to zero in the euphotic zone, collapsing the potential new primary production in the coastal domain. At the end of February 1998, the nutricline shoaled to 40 dbar at the coast although it remained anomalously deep offshore. Higher temperatures and lower nutrient levels were observed for the entire section through August 1998 although in contrast with the previous winter, there was a strong freshening mainly due to an onshore movement of subarctic waters. ]"

Crab exploitation and degradation of the mangrove forests have increased over the last decades therefore threatening the capture fishery. The preferred market size crab has consistently decreased from more than 1 kg two decades ago to the current size of 0.5 kg therefore posing both management and livelihood threat to the critical ecosystem (mangrove) and coastal populations. To meet the increased tourist and export demand and provide surplus for the local community while conserving the critical crab ecosystem, small-scale aquaculture has been initiated in the concept of silvofisheries. Initial culture methods have targeted sub-adult crabs of 150–350 g for culture to market size (&gt;0.5 kg) in drive-in cages and pens (mud crab fattening). These technology attained survival of between 50 and 70% and a market price of 5 dollars per kilogram. However, research is ongoing to assess viability of stocking juvenile seed crabs directly in ponds as practised in South East Asia (SEA) as opposed to stocking of sub-adults in drive-in cages. In comparison with other areas, crab capture fisheries in East Africa have limited management and enforcement frameworks/capabilities within the wider regional fisheries policies. Also there is limited understanding of wild mud crab resources and suitable management options to avoid over-exploitation as observed in SEA. The double-edged demand (wild market size capture and juvenile capture for aquaculture) for mud crabs in addition to mangrove degradation are likely to cause great challenges to stock exploitation and livelihoods of the coastal people dependent on the resource. This review paper provides an inside onto the tradition, trends and options for development of mud crab capture and culture in Kenya. ]"

Following an actualistic approach, the ecology of extant relatives of the most abundant and diverse fossil groups recorded in the CKL (i.e., vascular plants , arthropods, fishes, and tetrapods) is considered. Data is based on an extensive literature review followed by a re-examination of recently collected fossils. This approach allowed a detailed appraisal of the stratigraphic/ecological distribution of the main fossil groups preserved in the CKL. Plant and animal groups are recorded in three main stratigraphic intervals, named Intervals I–III in ascending order. Most fossils are to be considered autochthonous to parautochthonous and have been preserved in distinct stages of base-level fluctuations within a shallow lacustrine depositional system, subject to periodic flooding in large, depressed areas. Exceptional preservation in such environments was mediated by microbially-induced processes (i.e., microbial mat entombment), mostly in the coastal areas of the alkaline lake. Based on the distinct sedimentary facies and autecological attributes of dominant paleo-bioindicators, a new paleoenvironmental model for the CKL is proposed, encompassing a seasonal, semi-arid, shallow lacustrine wetland. Faunal and floral content were ecologically arranged in long-lasting aquatic zones, surrounded by periodically flooded mesophytic ecotones and outer xeric habitats, as in the modern alkaline lake Chad in Africa. Our data show the relevance of multiproxy analyses (i.e., paleontological, sedimentological, geochemical, and stratigraphic) of exceptional fossil sites for assessing paleoenvironmental conditions in depositional settings subject to continuous base-level changes, such as those existing in complex, present-day wetland ecosystems . The recognition of key parameters in ancient wetlands is of great importance concerning the formation of non-marine Konservat-Lagerstätten in the geological record . ]"

In today's ocean such sediments are deposited in coastal upwelling areas like those in the Gulf of California, off Peru or off the Namibian coast and euxinic basins like the Black Sea. In an attempt to distinguish both environments by their specific TM patterns, some important conclusions may be drawn: 1) The TM enrichment seen in both environments broadly is rather similar. 2) Upwelling sediments are often enriched in Cd and P and depleted in Co and Mn. 3) Sapropels have a tendency towards higher enrichments in Ba and Mo, S, Re, As, Cu, Ni, Sb, and Fe, reflecting the strong sulfidation in an anoxic water column. 4) Upwelling systems cover a broad range of environmental settings where the steepness of the slope, the proximity of H 2 S to the sediment seawater interface and the intensity of bio-accumulation and regeneration play an important role for TM accumulation. 5) The TM content of anoxic basins is mainly controlled by TM availability in the water column and sedimentation rate. 6) Enhanced bio-productivity is the main switch turning an oxygenated into an anoxic environment. Cretaceous black shales (OAE 2) exhibit TM signatures of both, coastal upwelling areas and sapropels. The strong enrichments in Cd, Mo, Tl, V, Cu, Ni, (Bi), and Sb demonstrate that bio-accumulation and presence of H 2 S in the water column and associated sulfidation processes persisted during this time interval in large parts of the Proto-Atlantic. The usefulness of Ba as a paleoproductivity-proxy is obscured by diagenesis. The extreme accumulation in Ag and Zn requires either an additional TM source, for instance hydrothermal input, or a different TM seawater composition during the Cretaceous. The geochemical data suggest, that the major driving force for the widespread occurrence of C/T black shales seems to be the increase in volcanic activity and associated CO 2 -input throughout the Cretaceous. The ocean-atmosphere system operated in a mode different from today during this time interval. After conversion of the “nutrient” CO 2 into organic matter the system switched back into the “normal” operational mode. ]"

Locally, the impact of the tsunami is one of the most severe disasters Samoa has experienced in the last several decades. Within one week of the event, 143 people died. Approximately 6000 traumatized men, women and children – terrified of the sea – refused to return to live or work in their rural, coastal villages, which in turn has had broad consequences for humanitarian emergency relief distribution networks and early recovery planning efforts. Researchers came from all over the world to participate in the UNESCO International Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Samoa International Tsunami Survey Team (ITST). Focusing on the need for interdisciplinary research, for the first time, a social impact assessment team (SIT) was expressly invited to participate. Within days of the tsunami, a group of Australian, New Zealand, American, Fijian, and Japanese disaster researchers began to discuss how they might develop a social science reconnaissance research plan using innovative approaches and best practice. This paper presents an overview of challenges faced by the social impact assessment team with a focus on lessons to be learnt from this experience. We discuss the need to clarify project boundaries, develop a core research agenda and project milestones, and develop day-to-day fieldwork work plans and at the same time be sensitive to the emotional needs of the interviewees as well as the researchers. We also make several practical suggestions for future social reconnaissance research with a set of recommendations to support disaster researchers as they plan their own research projects. The inclusion of a social impacts assessment group within a UNESCO-IOC ITST was a valuable response to the increasing need for responsible social research in sensitive topics of post-disaster analysis. Social scientists are aware that disaster social science research should not be a risk to the public, and that misconduct in such work should be avoided as far as possible. We believe that the inclusion of social science experts will revolutionise conceptual, methodological and empirical approaches in future ITSTs. Social scientists will provide unprecedented volumes of high quality information on post-disaster movements, communication and response activities by individuals, communities, private and public sectors — because social scientists are concerned about the integrity of the research process and results. Building upon our experiences, future ITSTs may tap into the potential that social science has to transform ITST's capacity to gather information about disaster preparedness , what tsunami survivors saw, heard and experienced, and to reconstruct the socio-economic and political dynamics of affected communities. This paper contributes to the limited literature that outlines how to develop responsible plans and processes for post-tsunami disaster work; and, it furthers a line of inquiry applicable to a wide variety of hazards, such as flooding, cyclones , earthquakes, bushfires, pandemics and terrorism. ]"

These layers show enhanced levels of bioturbation , peaks in Mn content, and typically contain elevated abundances of planktonic and benthic micro- and nannofossils . It was early surmised that these layers were deposited under interglacial conditions and that their cyclical downcore occurrence could be correlated to the global benthic oxygen isotope curve. However, the synchronicity of Mn layers with interglacial conditions and the underlying mechanisms responsible for their formation remain controversial. Here we compile and synthesize findings of the last decades with several recent studies that shed light on issues such as the sources of Mn to the Arctic Ocean, the processes and pathways for Mn to the deep sea, the chemical processes active in the sediment, and the spatial and temporal distribution of Mn-rich layers in Arctic deep marine sediments . Budget calculations show that about 90% of Mn input to the Arctic Ocean originates from Arctic rivers or coastal erosion , two sources effectively shut down during mid- to late Quaternary glacial intervals by continental ice sheets blocking or re-directing the rivers and vast subaerial exposure of the shelf areas. Thus, the strong late Quaternary interglacial-glacial cyclicity in Mn content is clearly an input-related signal, and only secondarily influenced by chemical processes in the water column and in the sediment. On the shelves, the Mn undergoes repeated geochemical recycling caused by the high organic carbon content in the sediments before it is ultimately exported to the deep basins where scavenging processes in the water column effectively bring the Mn to the sea floor in the form of Mn (oxyhydr)oxides. The close synchronicity with enhanced bioturbation and elevated micro and nannofossil abundances shows that the Mn peaks are preserved at a stratigraphic level closely corresponding to the interglacial intervals. However, under certain biogeochemical conditions, Mn (oxyhydr)oxides may diagenetically become both dissolved and re-precipitated deep in the sediments, as shown by pore water analyses and X-ray radiograph studies. Dissolution is particularly conspicuous in late Quaternary sediments from the Lomonosov Ridge, where in rapidly deposited coarse grained intervals (diamictons) with elevated total organic carbon (TOC) contents, Mn appears almost completely removed from within the glacial sediments , and also the surrounding interglacial sediments. Correspondingly, bundles of closely spaced, mm-thick, Mn-rich horizontal bands are observed in sediment otherwise devoid of indicators for interglacial conditions, suggesting that these bands were purely formed by diagenetic processes redistributing the Mn from deeper sediment layers. This type of diagenetic Mn redistribution within the sediment can be recognized in XRF-core scanner data combined with sedimentological information from X-ray radiographs, while pore water data are highly promising if clear diagenetic features in the sediment are missing. With this increasing ability to recognize intervals where a diagenetic overprint exists in the Mn record, the recently improved understanding of the Mn cycle in the Arctic Ocean provides a conceptual paleoenvironmental framework in which carefully applied Mn stratigraphy can provide a powerful correlation tool, when combined with other paleoceanographic proxies and sedimentological data. ]"

They regulate the fluxes of nutrients, pollutants, pathogens and viruses that determine whether coastlines achieve the Good Environmental Status (GEnS) required by the EU's Marine Strategy Directive. We review 20th century trends and 21st century projections of changes to climatic drivers, and their potential for altering estuarine bio-physical processes. Sea-level rise will cause some marine habitats to expand, and others diminish in area extent. The overall consequences of estuarine morphodynamics to these habitat shifts, and vice-versa, are unknown. Increased temperatures could intensify microbial pathogen concentrations and increase public health risk. The patterns of change of other climatic drivers are difficult to predict (e.g., river flows and storm surges). Projected increased winter river flows throughout UK catchments will enhance the risks of coastal eutrophication , harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in some contexts, although there are spatial variabilities in river flow projections. The reproductive success of estuarine biota is sensitive to saline intrusion and corresponding turbidity maxima, which are projected to gradually shift landwards as a result of sea-level rise. Although more-frequent flushing events in winter and longer periods of drought in summer are predicted, whereby the subsequent estuarine mixing and recovery rates are poorly understood. With rising estuarine salinities , subtidal species can penetrate deeper into estuaries , although this will depend on the resilience/adaptation of the species. Many climate and impact predictions lack resolution and spatial cover.

Rather than simply constituting recurrent “windows” in the sea ice, polynyas are profoundly affected by, and intimately linked to, local and even regional ice conditions (i.e., the “icescape”). They respond sensitively to thermodynamic and dynamic forcing by the ocean and atmosphere and entail ecologically important “oases” that enable birds and mammals to overwinter at high latitudes and encourage enhanced primary production in the spring. In this review, we introduce the concept of polynyas from the perspective of the sea ice conditions/processes that define them. We discuss the unique characteristics of polynyas in both polar regions, and assess their possible response/contribution to climate variability and change.

Uniquely, the long, zonal shelf is subject to an equatorward Sverdrup transport that gives rise to the Flinders Current – a small sister to the world’s major Western Boundary Currents. The Flinders Current is strongest near the 600 m isobath where the current speeds can reach 20 cm/s and the bottom boundary layer is upwelling favourable. It is larger in the west but likely intermittent in both space and time due to possibly opposing winds, thermohaline circulation and mesoscale eddies. The Flinders Current may be important to deep upwelling within the ubiquitous canyons of the region. During winter, the Leeuwin Current and local winds act to drive eastward currents that average up to 20–30 cm/s. The currents associated with the intense coastal-trapped wave-field (6–12 day band) are of order 25–30 cm/s and can peak at 80–90 cm/s. Wintertime winds and cooling also lead to downwelling to depths of 200 m or more and the formation of dense coastal water within the Great Australian Bight and the South Australian Sea. Within the Great Australian Bight, the thermohaline circulation associated with this dense water is unknown, but may enhance the eastward shelf-edge, South Australian Current. The dense salty water formed within Spencer Gulf is known to cascade as a gravity current to depths of 200 m off Kangaroo Island. This dense water outflow and meanders in the shelf circulation also fix the locations of a sequence of quasi-permanent mesoscale eddies between the Eyre Peninsula and Portland. During summer, the average coastal winds reverse and surface heating leads to the formation of warm water in the western Great Australian Bight and the South Australian Sea. No significant exchange of shelf water and gulf water appears to occur due to the presence of a dense, nutrient-rich (sub-surface) pool that is upwelled off Kangaroo Island. The winds lead to weak average coastal currents (&lt;10 cm/s) that flow to the north-west. In the Great Australian Bight, the wind stress curl can lead to an anticyclonic circulation gyre that can result in shelf-break downwelling in the western Great Australian Bight and the formation of the eastward, South Australian Current. In the east, upwelling favourable winds and coastal-trapped waves can lead to deep upwelling events off Kangaroo Island and the Bonney Coast that occur over 3–10 days and some 2–4 times a season. The alongshore currents here can be large (∼40 cm/s) and the vertical scales of upwelling are of order 150 m (off Kangaroo Island) and 250 m (off the Bonney Coast). Increasing evidence suggests that El Nino events (4–7 year period) can have a major impact on the winter and summer circulation. These events propagate from the Pacific Ocean and around the shelf-slope wave-guide of West Australia and into the Great Australian Bight. During winter El Nino events, the average shelf currents may be largely shut-down. During summer, the thermocline may be raised by up to 150 m. The nature and role of tides and surface waves is also discussed along with uncertainties in the general circulation and future research. ]"

Magnetite chemistry has been used as a petrogenetic indicator to identify the geological environment of ore formation and as a fingerprint of the source reservoir of iron. In this study, we present new textural and microanalytical EPMA and LA-ICP-MS data of magnetite from Carmen, Fresia, Mariela and El Romeral IOA deposits located in the Cretaceous Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile. We also provide a comprehensive summary and discussion of magnetite geochemistry from Andean IOAs including Los Colorados, Cerro Negro Norte, El Romeral (Chilean Iron Belt) and the Pliocene El Laco IOA deposit located in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Chilean Andes. Microtextures coupled with geochemical data were used to define and characterize the occurrence of different magnetite types. Magnetite exhibits a variety of textural features including oscillatory zoning, colloform banding, re-equilibration textures, exsolution lamellae and symplectites. The magmatic vs. hydrothermal origin of the different magnetite types and the evolution of IOA deposits can be assessed using diagrams based on compatible trace elements. However, magnetite is very susceptible to hydrothermal alteration and to both textural and compositional re-equilibration during magmatic and superimposed hydrothermal events. Based on the data presented here, we conclude that V and Ga are possibly the most reliable compatible elements in magnetite to trace ore-forming processes in the Andean IOA deposits. Magnetite chemistry reveals different conditions/events of formation for each IOA deposit ranging from high-temperature, low-oxygen fugacity ( ƒ O 2 ), purely magmatic (&gt;600 °C) conditions; to lower temperature and higher ƒ O 2 magmatic-hydrothermal (300–600 °C) to low-temperature hydrothermal (&lt;200–300 °C) conditions. Specifically, a continuous transition from high-temperature, low- ƒ O 2 conditions in the deepest portions of the deposits to low-temperature, relatively higher ƒ O 2 conditions towards surface are described for magnetite from El Laco. The new and compiled magnetite data from IOA deposits from the Chilean Iron Belt and El Laco are consistent with a transition from magmatic to hydrothermal conditions. The flotation model plausibly explains such features, which result from the crystallization of magnetite microlites from a silicate melt, nucleation and coalescence of aqueous fluid bubbles on magnetite surfaces, followed by ascent of a fluid-magnetite suspension along reactivated transtensional faults or through fissures formed during the collapse of the volcanic structure (El Laco). The decompression of the coalesced fluid-magnetite aggregates during ascent promotes the continued growth of magnetite microlites from the Fe-rich magmatic-hydrothermal fluid. As with any general genetic model, the flotation model allows variation and the definition of different styles or subtypes of IOA mineralization . The deeper, intrusive-like Los Colorados deposit shows contrasting features when compared with the Cerro Negro Norte hydrothermal type, the pegmatitic apatite-rich deposits of Carmen, Fresia and Mariela, and the shallow, subaerial deposits of El Laco. These apparent differences depend fundamentally on the depth of formation, the presence of structures and faults that trigger decompression, the composition of the host rocks, and the source and flux rate of hydrothermal fluids . ]"

They record the development on the present-day northeastern side of the Mesoproterozoic Belt Basin of a carbonate platform early in the basin history while it was still relatively deep. The Waterton–Altyn succession documents a shallowing-upward, westward-prograding, broadly ramp-style platform composed of mixed carbonate–siliciclastic sediments. Five main facies types are recognized: Laminite, Ribbon, Grainstone , Oolite and Stromatolite . The first two were formed of lime muds deposited on the ramp and outer platform under low-energy conditions. The Grainstone facies consists of sand-sized peloids, aggregates and intraclasts plus admixed quartz and feldspar sand, microspar grains, radial ooids and silicified oolite and anhydrite . The Oolite facies is dominated by ooids with a concentric cortex. These are allochthonous coarse-grained particles interpreted to have been transported westward to a marginal belt and outer platform mainly by tsunami off-surge from the platform interior, coastal sand shoals and tidal-flat sabkhas , outcrops of which are not preserved. Absence of hummocky or swaley cross-stratification suggests that the platform was not affected by strong storms. Instead, flat-pebble conglomerates on the ramp are ascribed to episodic, tsunami-induced wave action which caused localized rupture and imbrication of flat pebbles. Scouring by tsunami off-surge produced intraclasts in the outer platform. There, this sediment lay undisturbed, but in the shallower marginal belt it was reworked by strong tidal currents which generated variably directed cross-lamination from dune and ripple migration and, locally, large sand bars with northwest-dipping clinoforms. Deformation features caused by synsedimentary earthquakes are common, with the various seismite types reflecting the facies-specific rheology of the sediment. Seismites in the lower Altyn Formation appear not to be linked to individual tsunami-lain dolograinstone beds in the outer platform, suggesting that these two sets of features were not generated by the same faults. The carbonate factory shut down when the platform was suffocated by siliciclastic mud sourced from the west, and tidal activity diminished as the whole basin shallowed. The interpretation of the carbonate platform presented herein is radically different from previous views that considered the Waterton and Altyn formations to be predominantly of shallow-subtidal and tidal-flat origin. These rocks are relevant to the appreciation of other carbonate platforms, especially in that tsunamis may be an under-appreciated agent of erosion and sediment transport offshore. ]"

We critically discuss existing work from freshwater and marine systems, laboratory studies and microbial batch culture experiments aiming to deduce common characteristics of the mineral's occurrence, and the processes governing its formation. Vivianite regularly occurs in close association with organic remains in iron-rich sediments. Simultaneously, it is a biogenic mineral product of metal reducing bacteria. These findings suggest that vivianite nucleation in natural systems is directed by the activity of such bacteria and crystal growth is particularly favoured within protected microzones. Taking into account recent findings from coastal marine sediments where vivianite authigenesis has been shown to be coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of methane, small-scale microbially mediated reactions appear to be crucial for the formation of vivianite. Small-scale heterogeneity within the sediment matrix may also explain why saturation calculations based upon bulk pore water constitutions often fail to accurately predict the occurrence of the mineral. Vivianite is not restricted to a specific trophic state of a system. The mineral forms in oligotrophic- as well as in eutrophic waters. However, depending on the iron inventory, the production, supply and degradation of organic matter determine the relative contribution of iron sulphide formation to the iron pool, and the concentration of inorganic phosphate and Fe 2 + in pore waters. Thus, vivianite authigenesis is also governed by bulk chemical conditions such as the rate of sulphide formation relative to that of Fe 2 + production. This situation allows stimulation of vivianite formation by iron supplementation aimed at restoring eutrophic lakes. Recent results from coastal marine sediments suggest that vivianite authigenesis is of significance for P burial in the marine realm. Vivianite authigenesis is likely important at the global scale, but has so far largely been ignored. ]"

Because the Baltic Sea is a semi- enclosed basin, winds from favorable directions blowing predominately parallel to the coast cause upwelling leading to vertical displacement of the water body and mixing. During the thermal stratified period, upwelling can lead to a strong sea-surface temperature drop of more than 10 °C changing drastically the thermal balance and stability conditions at the sea-surface. Upwelling can play a key role in replenishing the euphotic zone with the nutritional components necessary for biological productivity when the surface layer is depleted of nutrients. Consequently, it has been found out that in such areas where upwelling lifts phosphorus-rich deep water to the surface, the N/P ratio becomes low which favors the blooming of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae. The rapid temperature decrease during such events was recognized and documented a long time ago when temperature measurements became available. Thus, the study of the upwelling process has a long tradition. However, although the importance of upwelling has generally been accepted for the Baltic Sea, no general review of upwelling exists. The objective of this paper is a comprehensive review of the upwelling process, its dynamics and reflections to ecosystem processes in the Baltic Sea using all relevant literature which will help to close the gaps of present knowledge and some recommendations for future work are outlined accordingly. ]"

Annual secondary production was calculated using size-frequency and empirical methods. , A biological study of suprabenthic mysids of genus Schistomysis (Crustacea, Mysida , Mysidae) was carried out based on quantitative samples collected in coastal waters of the SE Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic) and the Catalan Sea (W Mediterranean). Aspects of the ecology of species noted during this study are summarized and the results of previous researches are incorporated. Small and large-scale environmental factors (swash and surf climate, depth, temperature, day–night and seasonal cycles) contributed significantly to population distributions. All Schistomysis populations are characterized by faster individual growth and earlier maturity at higher temperature, resulting in intensive recruitment during spring or summer seasons in combination with higher fecundity of genitors. Regarding productivity, our production and P / B ¯ P / B ¯ estimates ranged between 2255–26,321 mg AFDW/100 m 3 /year and 6.09–9.73, respectively. These production values are similar to those found for comparable marine mysids with two or three generations per year. The observed demographic heterogeneity and production of populations has ecological implications in the Bay of Biscay and Mediterranean areas, where Schistomysis species are dominant components of littoral and shelf suprabenthic communities. ]"

Although they have annually delivered ~ 2000 × 10 9 kg of sediment to the ocean since 1000 yr BP, they presently contribute only ~ 600 × 10 9 kg/yr, which is reverting to a level typical of the relatively undisturbed watersheds before the rise in human activities in East and Southeast Asia at 2000 yr BP. During the most recent decades flow regulation by dams and sediment entrapment by reservoirs, as well as human-influenced soil erosion in the river basins, have sharply reduced the sediment delivered from the large river basins to the ocean. We constructed a time series of data on annual water discharges and sediment fluxes from these large rivers to the western Pacific Ocean covering the period 1950–2008. These data indicate that the short-term (interannual scale) variation of sediment flux is dominated by natural climatic oscillations such as the El Niño/La Niña cycle and that anthropogenic causes involving dams and land use control the long-term (decadal scale) decrease in sediment flux to the ocean. In contrast to the relatively slow historical increase in sediment flux during the period 2000–1000 yr BP, the recent sediment flux has been decreased at an accelerating rate over centennial scales. The alterations of these large river systems by both natural and anthropogenic forcing present severe environmental challenges in the coastal ocean, including the sinking of deltas and declines in coastal wetland areas due to the decreasing sediment supply. Our work thus provides a regional perspective on the large river-derived sediment flux to the ocean over millennial and decadal scales, which will be important for understanding and managing the present and future trends of delivery of terrigenous sediment to the ocean in the context of global change. ]"

The 1997–98 El Niño event was defined by higher than normal sea levels at Monterey, which began in June 1997, peaked in November 1997, and returned to normal in March 1998. The warming took place in two distinct periods. During June and July 1997, the sea level increased as a result of stronger than normal coastal warming below 200 dbars and within 100 km of the coast, which was associated with poleward flow of saltier waters. During this period, deeper (400–1000 dbar) waters between 150–200 km from shore were also warmed and became more saline. Subsequently, sea level continued to rise through January 1998, mostly as a result of the warming above 200 dbars although, after a brief period of cooling in September 1997, waters below 200 dbar were also warmer than normal during this period. This winter warm anomaly was also coastally trapped, extending 200 km from shore and was accompanied by cooler and fresher water in the offshore California current. In March and April 1998, sea level dropped quickly to normal levels and inshore waters were fresher and warmer than the previous spring and flowed southward. The warming was consistent with equatorial forcing of Central California waters via propagation of Kelvin or coastally-trapped waves. The observed change in heat content associated with the 1997–98 El Niño was the same as that observed during the previous seasonal cycle. The warming and freshening events were similar to events observed during the 1957–58 and 1982–83 El Niños. ]"

We analyze atmospheric and upper oceanic anomalies in the northeast Pacific (NEP) during these events, and compare them to anomalies both elsewhere in the north and tropical Pacific, and to typical EN and LN anomaly patterns. The atmospheric and oceanic anomalies varied strongly on intraseasonal and interannual scales. During the 1995–97 LN and 1997–98 EN, the Northeast Pacific was dominated by negative SLP and cyclonic wind anomalies, and by upper ocean temperature and sea surface height (SSH) anomalies. The latter were positive along the North American west coast and in the NEP thermal anomaly pool (between Hawaii, Vancouver Island, and Baja California), and negative in the central north Pacific. This atmospheric/oceanic anomaly pattern is typical of EN. An eastward shift in the atmospheric teleconnection from east Asia created EN-like anomalies in the NEP during the 1995–97 LN, well before the 1997–98 EN had begun. The persistence of negative sea-level pressure (SLP) and cyclonic wind anomalies in the NEP during the 1997–98 EN intensified pre-existing upper oceanic anomalies. Atmospheric anomalies were shifted eastward during late 1996–early 1998, leading to a similar onshore shift of oceanic anomalies. This produced exceptionally strong positive upper ocean temperature and SSH anomalies along the west coast during the 1997–98 EN, and explains the unusual coastal occurrences of several species of large pelagic warm-water fishes. The growth and eastward shift of these pre-existing anomalies does not appear to have been linked to tropical Pacific EN anomalies until late 1997, when a clear atmospheric teleconnection between the two regions developed. Prior to this, remote atmospheric impacts on the NEP were primarily from east Asia. As the 1998–2001 LN developed, NEP anomalies began reversing toward the typical LN pattern. This led to predominantly negative SLP and cyclonic wind anomalies in the NEP, and upper ocean temperature and SSH anomalies that were mainly negative along the west coast and positive in the central north Pacific. The persistence of these anomalies into mid-2001, and a number of concurrent biological changes in the NEP, suggest that a decadal climate shift may have occurred in late 1998. During 1995–2001, NEP oceanic anomalies tracked the overlying atmospheric anomalies, as indicated by the maintenance of a characteristic spatial relationship between these anomalies. In particular, wind stress curl and SSH anomalies in the NEP maintained an inverse relationship that strengthened and shifted eastward toward the west coast during late 1996–early 1998. This consistent relationship indicates that anomalous Ekman transport driven by regional atmospheric forcing was an important contributor to temperature and SSH anomalies in the NEP and CCS during the 1997–98 EN. Other studies have shown that coastal propagations originating from the tropical Pacific also may have contributed to coastal NEP anomalies during this EN. Our results indicate that at least some of this coastal anomaly signal may have been generated by regional atmospheric forcing within the NEP. ]"

For Holocene times, coastlines displaced from the present mean sea-level are often used together with past relative sea-level (RSL) prediction models to decipher the vertical deformational field. Along the coastline from southwest Turkey eastward to Israel and Cyprus, field data that constrain Holocene vertical movements are already published, leaving a gap only along the Mediterranean coast of the Central Anatolian Plateau (CAP). Based on new field observations between Alanya and Adana (Mersin, southern Turkey), together with AMS 14 C dating, we fill that gap, allowing for the construction of a continuous overview of Holocene vertical differential movements along the Eastern Mediterranean coast. We apply the most recent Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) models to correct for the glacio-hydro isostatic component of the RSL. Different solutions from the ICE-6G(VM5a) and ICE-7G(VM7) models (developed by W.R. Peltier and co-workers at the Toronto University), and a GIA model developed by K. Lambeck and collaborators at the Australian National University, have been applied to 200 middle-to-late Holocene RSL markers. Starting from southwest Turkey, we find subsidence between −0.9 mm/yr and − 2.3 mm/yr, corroborating estimates from previous studies. Velocities from the new markers along the CAP Mediterranean coast are positive, ranging between 0.9 and 1.5 mm/yr. These two first blocks are separated by a sharp velocity jump, occurring along the Isparta Angle Fault System one. Such high vertical velocities for the CAP southern margin were predicted by recently published papers that report a rapid uplift phase that peaked during themiddle to late Pleistocene. Moving to the east, velocities are also positive, from 0.2 to 0.6 mm/yr along the coast between the Hatay Gulf and southern Lebanon. The highly variable velocity along the Lebanese sector is likely due to co-seismic deformation along the Lebanese Restraining Bend (LRB) faults. To the south, in contrast, the Israeli coast shows stability, according to some unique archaeological RSL markers named piscinae, whereas other markers indicate slow subsidence (−0.2 mm/yr on average). Hence, another velocity jump of at least 0.5 mm/yr is recognizable between Israel and Lebanon. This jump is probably associated with mapped, active tectonic structures. In Northern Cyprus, the only Holocene sea-level marker confirms the near zero vertical velocity values already obtained for the MIS 5e marine terrace. Therefore, a vertical velocity jump occurs between stable Northern Cyprus and the uplifting CAP southern margin, although they occur on the same overriding plate of the Eastern Mediterranean subduction system. High-angle normal faults at the northern margin of the Adana-Cilicia Basin could explain these strongly distinct late Holocene vertical velocity fields. These results depict a complex framework of independently moving crustal blocks, with kinematic separation along well-known regional fault zones. The drivers of the block movements could be related either to regional tectonics, as it is probably the case for the LRB coast, or to mantle dynamics, such as for the uplifting Turkish sector, where deeper processes should be considered. ]"

Observations made during 1976 and 1977, many made as part of the Coastal Upwelling Ecosystem Analysis JOINT-II expedition, provide the basis for an interpretative description of the physical processes and phenomena occurring in Peru coastal waters. Four important phenomena are discussed: wind-driven upwelling, the poleward undercurrent, surface mixed layer deepening, and low-frequency coastal-trapped waves. The coastal winds were invariably favorable for coastal upwelling, even during the 1976 El Niño. The agreement between the offshore transport in the relatively shallow (30 m) surface layer and the Ekman transport, deduced from the local wind, was good for both the mean and variable state. The agreement with the deeper onshore transport was less good, consistent with the marked three-dimensionally and spatial variability of the upwelling. The poleward undercurrent was apparently continuous from 5°S to at least 15°S, flowing just below the surface layer over the continental shelf and slope, and supplying the upwelling water. The variability in the alongshore velocity field was dominated by baroclinic free coastal-trapped waves with periods of 5–20 days. Although there is appreciable temporal and spatial variability in the Peru coastal upwelling system, the upwelling, the undercurrent, and the low-frequency coastal-trapped waves were ubiquitous. ]"

They not only damage the marine environment, but also cause economic losses to coastal cities. However, there is still no fully effective approach for preventing green tides. In this article, approaches for the prevention of U . prolifera taken over recent years are reviewed. They can be generally divided into physical, chemical, and biological approaches. Physical approaches have been used to control the overwhelming green macroalgae bloom and inhibit the germination of U . prolifera , including physical salvage approach, refrigeration net technology, improved farming methods and raft technology, and modified clay method. These approaches require significant labor and material resources. Many chemical reagents have been used to eliminate U . prolifera early germination and growth, such as oxidative algaecide , acid treatment, heavy metal compounds, antifouling coating, and alkaloids .

Subcategories are discussed largely in terms of estuaries , lakes and reservoirs. The term fetch-limited refers to basins that are small enough that distance rather than wind duration is always a limitation to wave generation. Attention is focused on basins where fetch distances are &lt; 50 km. The dimensions of small basins provide a limit on the energy potential of the waves, causing geologic and biologic controls to be more significant and wind-induced currents, tidal currents and ice to be relatively more effective than on exposed beaches. Shoreline orientations differ greatly over short distances, causing great differences in exposure to dominant winds and isolating beach segments. Limited longshore sediment exchanges result in beach sediments that closely resemble local source materials. The absence of high-energy waves causes beaches and bar forms to be smaller, and the absence of swell waves following storms and the relatively calm conditions reduces the speed of recovery of post-storm profiles and the cyclic nature of beach response. The beaches are often fronted by flat shallow platforms that undergo little morphologic change and help dissipate waves at low water levels. The narrow beaches are poor sources of sediment for wind-blown sand and dunes are small or frequently absent. The narrow beaches and reduced wave energies allow upland vegetation and algae and seagrass to grow close to the active foreshore. This vegetation, the wrack deposited on the beach, and driftwood logs are better able to resist the low-energy waves and are more effective in resisting beach change. Erosion rates of 2–3 m yr − 1 are common in some estuaries and can be &gt; 7 m yr − 1 . Rates of up to 1.5 m yr − 1 can occur in small lakes and reservoirs. Shore parallel protection structures are common and have greater survivability in low-energy environments than high-energy environments; they are cheaper to build; and they have been implemented more frequently to control erosion . Their effect has been to reduce the extent of beach in small water bodies. Beach nourishment projects have been fewer than on exposed shores and the quantities smaller. Many nourishment projects have been implemented for amenity value and have been placed in locations where waves have not been able to create an equilibrium landform . The biggest difference in process controls between estuaries and lakes and reservoirs is in the mechanism for water level change. Tides and surges from external basins are important on estuarine beaches, whereas rainfall, runoff, groundwater flow , evapotranspiration and control by dams are more important in reservoirs and lakes. Future sea level rise will threaten beach environments in estuaries where shore parallel walls will prevent onshore migration of landforms and habitats and will change the number and locations of beaches in unarmored areas. Dam removal will pose a threat to the existence of reservoirs and dammed lakes. Water levels are more dependent on human actions in lakes and reservoirs, so changes can be minimal or increased to a greater extent than in estuaries. Lesser stability and predictability of beaches will complicate future management efforts. ]"

Determining the sources of fine-grained sediment thus represents an important requirement for watershed and coastal management, as well as for understanding the evolution of landscapes and ocean basins. Sediment source fingerprinting utilizes the diagnostic physical, chemical and biological properties (i.e., tracers) of source materials to enable samples of collected sediment to be apportioned to these sources. This review examines the development of the technique within the earth and ocean sciences, focusing mainly on agricultural landscapes. However, the development of new tracers, such as compound-specific stable isotopes , has allowed the technique to be applied in a growing number of environmental settings including forested (including wildfire-impacted forests), urban and estuarine/coastal settings. This review also describes other applications of the fingerprinting approach such as geoarchaeological (e.g., archaeological site formation), forensic (e.g., identifying the sources of soil/sediment particles in criminal investigations) and human health (e.g., identifying the sources of airborne particulate matter , PM 2.5 ) applications. Identifying commonalities in methods and approaches between environments and disciplines should foster collaboration and the exchange of ideas. Furthermore, refinement of the sediment source fingerprinting technique requires that several methodological issues be addressed. These methodological issues range from the initial sampling design to the interpretation of the final apportionment results. This review also identifies and assesses these methodological concerns. ]"

The magmatic record consists of a coastal plutonic belt dominated by granites and granodiorites with minor mafic and intermediate intrusions and an inland volcanic belt dominated by intermediate and silicic volcanic centers. The juxtaposition of the plutonic belt with the trench indicates the removal of most of the Paleogene forearc during the Oligocene . Abundant evidence indicates that subduction erosion played a significant role in the reconfiguration of the continental margin of southern Mexico following cessation of magmatism . This is evident in the subsidence of continental segments contiguous to the present trench and the loss of lower continental crust as inferred from the present shape of the wedge, as well as in the estimations of the former crustal thickness based on geobarometry of the exposed levels of plutonic complexes. The Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic decreasing age trend in the SMS shows three time intervals in which magmatism ceased at different rates. The general southeastward younging trend of magmatism, as well as the left-lateral shear zones of the central and coastal zones of the Sierra Madre del Sur, in combination with constraints imposed by the prevalent model of the Caribbean plate evolution have been invoked to consider the Chortís block as the removed segment during margin truncation. The main drawbacks of this model are the mismatch in the chronology of migmatitic complexes of northern Chortís and the Xolapa terrane in the continental margin of southern Mexico, and the presence of the Late Cretaceous to present unperturbed marine sequence in the Gulf of Tehuantepec in the assumed trajectory of the Chortís block. These considerations and the subduction erosion evidence suggest a more complex scenario than having Chortís juxtaposed immediately adjacent to the present-day margin. There are alternative possibilities to explain removal of the forearc, ranging from a western provenance for the Chortís block, as has been suggested in other models, to intermediate positions for Chortís with a more southern trajectory with respect to the present-day trench. Such a trajectory would leave a broad zone with shear strain structures more susceptible to removal by subduction erosion after the passage of the trench-trench transform triple junction . This would reconcile the evidence of subduction erosion and the indications of the northwestern provenance of the Chortís block. ]"

Several delta lobes follow each other and have participated in the deltaic evolution.

Two delta lobe systems were built by the Daladel and Peccaïs channels, after which a deflected wave-influenced delta lobe was formed by the La Ville and Saint-Roman channels. The latest channel, the Rhone Vif channel, is skewed because this channel was completely canalized and engineered up to its mouth in the beginning of the 16th century.

However, little is known about the role of tropical peatlands in the global carbon cycle. We therefore determine the past rates of carbon storage and release in the Indonesian peatlands of Kalimantan and Sumatra – the largest global concentration of tropical peatlands – since 20 ka (kiloannum before present). Using a novel GIS (geographic information system) approach we provide a spatially-explicit reconstruction of peatland expansion in a series of paleogeographic maps. Sea-level change is identified as the principal driver for peatland formation and expansion in western Indonesia as it controls both atmospheric moisture supply and the hydrological gradient on the islands. Initiation of inland peatlands in Kalimantan was coupled to periods of rapid deglacial sea-level rise with rates of over 10 mm yr −1 whereas coastal peatlands could only form after 7 ka when the rate of sea-level rise had slowed to 2.4 mm yr −1 . Falling sea levels after 5 ka led to rapid peatland expansion in coastal lowlands and a doubling of the total peatland area in western Indonesia to 131,500 km 2 between 2.3 ka and 0 ka. As a result of slow peatland expansion from 15 to 6 ka and rapid expansion afterwards the rate of annual carbon storage of all western Indonesian peatlands remained &lt;1 Tg C yr −1 until 6 ka and then increased to 7.2 Tg C yr −1 by 0 ka. Associated with this rise in carbon storage was an exponential growth of the peat carbon pool from 0.01 Pg C by 15 ka to 23.2 Pg C at present, of which 70% is stored in coastal peatlands. In inland Kalimantan peatlands, falling sea levels together with increased El Niño activity induced an annual carbon release of 0.15 Tg C yr −1 from aerobic peat decay since 2 ka. Cumulative carbon losses from anaerobic decomposition do not seem to limit peat bog growth in the tropical peatlands of Indonesia. Carbon losses from Holocene peat fires are only known from the Kutai basin since 4.4 ka with an associated release of 0.1–3.6 Tg C per fire event, which never surpassed the contemporaneous annual C storage. The peatlands of western Indonesia were thus a persistent carbon sink since 15 ka but this sink was of global importance only over the past 2000 years when it likely contributed to a slower growth in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Currently, annual losses of carbon from peat drainage and fires are on average 28 times higher than the pre-disturbance rate of uptake implying that this carbon reservoir has recently switched from being a net carbon sink to a significant source of atmospheric carbon and is currently in danger of eradication. ]"

This review provides guidance to select the most appropriate datasets and processing techniques for tropical cyclone disaster management.

The influence of river runoff (e.g. Yellow River) on the flushing is negligible. , We review the key processes controlling the net water circulation in shallow straits. The circulation is mainly barotropic, driven by the difference in mean sea level and tides on either side of the strait, the wind, the meandering of the currents in the adjoining seas, the bathymetry including the shape and width of the mouths and the presence of narrows, shoals, sills, islands, and lateral embayments. As the oceanography forcing can be non-synchronised on either side of the strait, the resulting net currents through the strait may appear chaotic. We apply these findings to the net circulation through the Bohai Strait in China using local wind, remote-sensing data of currents and sea level, and a hydrodynamic model. The net currents through the Bohai Strait were episodic. They were largest during winter storms when the wind generated a cyclonic coastal current in the northern Yellow Sea that flowed across the width of the Bohai Strait. Like the Luzon Strait, this current meandered and a branch of the current intruded into the northern Bohai Strait along the deeper channel. The wind set-up in the Bohai Sea and the wind-driven longshore current in the southern Bohai Sea generated a seaward flow through the southern Bohai Strait, somewhat like in Irbe Strait. As with the straits of the Seto Inland Sea , stagnation occurred in some embayments. As in the Torres Strait , the islands in the southern Bohai Strait retarded the net flow and increased the width of the outflow zone. These flows were also modulated at very long periods (∼60 days) by long waves in the Yellow Sea, possibly generated by meandering of the Kuroshio Current that created an additional sea level slope through the strait. The transit time in the Bohai Strait was 60 and 10 days, respectively, during calm weather and winter storms. The residence time in the Bohai Sea was estimated to be about 1.68 years by the LOICZ model and 1.56 years by the hydrodynamic model, and the influence of the river runoff, including the Yellow River, was negligible. ]"

Rigs-to-Reefs converts decommissioned oil and gas platforms into artificial reefs. Reefing old oil and gas platforms is done globally where offshore production has been developed. Oil platforms off California are among the most productive marine fish habitats. California must decide whether to reef old platforms or removal them from coastal waters. , Consideration of whether to completely remove an oil and gas production platform from the seafloor or to leave the submerged jacket as a reef is an imminent decision for California, as a number of offshore platforms in both state and federal waters are in the early stages of decommissioning. Laws require that a platform at the end of its production life be totally removed unless the submerged jacket section continues as a reef under state sponsorship. Consideration of the eventual fate of the populations of fishes and invertebrates beneath platforms has led to global reefing of the jacket portion of platforms instead of removal at the time of decommissioning. The construction and use of artificial reefs are centuries old and global in nature using a great variety of materials. The history that led to the reefing option for platforms begins in the mid-20th century in an effort for general artificial reefs to provide both fishing opportunities and increase fisheries production for a burgeoning U.S. population. The trend toward reefing platforms at end of their lives followed after the oil and gas industry installed thousands of standing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico where they had become popular fishing destinations. The National Fishing Enhancement Act and subsequent National Artificial Reef Plan laid the foundation for Rig-to-Reefs. Reefing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico is a well-established practice that is also applied globally. Deliberation of reefing decommissioned platforms and many years of scientific study beneath California platforms has culminated in a California State law that now allows consideration of the concept. This paper summarizes the history, practices, published science, and available information involved when considering the reefing option. It is hoped that this material will inform the public, policy makers, and regulators about their upcoming decisions. ]"

Critical lack of surveillance of pathogenic organisms in bathing water is evident. Need to integrate current monitoring methods with more inclusive parameters. Highlight's health risk from organisms undetected by current regulatory methods. Greater understanding of health risk associated with bathing waters is needed. , Globally, water-based bathing pastimes are important for both mental and physical health. However, exposure to waterborne organisms could present a substantial public health issue. Bathing waters are shown to contribute to the transmission of illness and disease and represent a reservoir and pathway for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) organisms. Current bathing water quality regulations focus on enumeration of faecal indicator organisms and are not designed for detection of specific waterborne organisms of public health concern (WOPHC), such as antimicrobial resistant (AMR)/pathogenic bacteria, or viruses. This investigation presents the first scoping review of the occurrence of waterborne organisms of public health concern (WOPHC) in identified natural bathing waters across the European Union (EU), which aimed to critically evaluate the potential risk of human exposure and to assess the appropriateness of the current EU bathing water regulations for the protection of public health. Accordingly, this review sought to identify and synthesise all literature pertaining to a selection of bacterial (C ampylobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. , Shigella spp. , Vibrio spp. , Pseudomonas spp., AMR bacteria), viral (Hepatitis spp. , enteroviruses , rotavirus, adenovirus, norovirus), and protozoan ( Giardia spp., and Cryptosporidium spp.) contaminants in EU bathing waters. Sixty investigations were identified as eligible for inclusion and data was extracted. Peer-reviewed investigations included were from 18 countries across the EU, totalling 87 investigations across a period of 35 years, with 30% published between 2011 and 2015. A variety of water bodies were identified, with 27 investigations exclusively assessing coastal waters. Waterborne organisms were classified into three categories; bacteria, viruses, and protozoa; amounting to 58%, 36% and 17% of the total investigations, respectively. The total number of samples across all investigations was 8,118, with detection of one or more organisms in 2,449 (30%) of these. Viruses were detected in 1281 (52%) of all samples where WOPHC were found, followed by bacteria (865(35%)) and protozoa (303(12%)). Where assessed (442 samples), AMR bacteria had a 47% detection rate, emphasising their widespread occurrence in bathing waters . Results of this scoping review highlight the potential public health risk of exposure to WOPHC in bathing waters that normally remain undetected within the current monitoring parameters. ]"

The smaller segments may include some currently slipping rather than locked. In this review, we outline general principles regarding indicators of relative sea-level change in tidal wetlands and the conditions in which paleoseismic indicators must be distinct from those resulting from non-seismic processes. We present new evidence from sites across southcentral Alaska to illustrate different detection limits of paleoseismic indicators and consider alternative interpretations for marsh submergence and emergence. We compare predictions of coseismic uplift and subsidence derived from geophysical models of earthquakes with different rupture modes. The spatial patterns of agreement and misfits between model predictions and quantitative reconstructions of coseismic submergence and emergence suggest that no earthquake within the last 4000 years had a pattern of rupture the same as the Mw 9.2 Alaska earthquake in 1964. From the Alaska examples and research from other subduction zones we suggest that If we want to understand whether a megathrust ruptures in segments of variable length in different earthquakes, we need to be site-specific as to what sort of geological-based criteria eliminate the possibility of a particular rupture mode in different earthquakes. We conclude that coastal paleoseismological studies benefit from a methodological framework that employs rigorous evaluation of five essential criteria and a sixth which may be very robust but only occur at some sites: 1 – lateral extent of peat-mud or mud-peat couplets with sharp contacts; 2 – suddenness of submergence or emergence, and replicated within each site; 3 – amount of vertical motion, quantified with 95% error terms and replicated within each site; 4 – syncroneity of submergence and emergence based on statistical age modelling; 5 – spatial pattern of submergence and emergence; 6 – possible additional evidence, such as evidence of a tsunami or liquefaction concurrent with submergence or emergence. We suggest that it is possible to consider detection limits as low as 0.1–0.2 m coseismic vertical change. ]"

Recent discoveries suggest a higher TFL prevalence than previously thought. TFLs provide habitat refugia and water supply in often inhospitable conditions. The TFL typology presented here identifies more than six distinct types. This study is the first step towards improving global awareness of TFLs. , Freshwater lenses are lenticular bodies of fresh (TDS &lt; 1000 mg/L) groundwater that develop above more saline groundwater within the same host aquifer due in part to buoyancy. In contrast to the widely studied situation of freshwater lenses in coastal aquifers, the formation, location and persistence of freshwater lenses in terrestrial settings are poorly understood. This is despite inland aquifers commonly containing saline groundwater, particularly in arid and semi-arid climates, and the local occurrences of freshwater being critical for ecosystems and human endeavour. We identify and classify known terrestrial freshwater lenses (TFLs) using four formation categories, namely topography, geology, groundwater-surface water interaction and recharge mechanisms. The resulting typology highlights the importance of buoyancy in the formation of TFLs in otherwise unlikely situations, implying that TFLs may be more prevalent than previously thought. TFLs represent some of the most vulnerable and precious freshwater resources on Earth that require considerably more research into mechanisms of formation and threats to their existence. ]"
542,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379199000347,[ Morphodynamics of Holocene salt marshes: a review sketch from the Atlantic and Southern North Sea coasts of Europe ],"[ Salt marshes, most now embanked, together with genetically related wetlands and high intertidal flats, make a major environmental contribution to the lowland coasts of Northwest Europe. They occur in many different contexts, but chiefly on open and barrier coasts and in estuaries and embayments, and range greatly in scale, from a modest total that measure hundreds of square kilometres in individual extent, to an enormous number each of an area no greater than tens to a few hundred hectares. These marshes and associated environments are under complex natural controls and experienced from the mid-Holocene onward human exploitation and, increasingly, interference. The main external controls are the sea-level, tidal and sediment-supply regimes. Intrinsic infuences are provided by the halophytic vegetation and sediment autocompaction. Upward sea-level movements and autocompaction combine to provide accomodation space within which marshes build upward. Field data and simulation modelling show that youthful mineralogenic marshes grow up rapidly and can mature within a few hundred years of inception. They consist of a vegetated platform dissected typically by extensive networks of blind-ended, branching tidal creeks and gullies. The flow-resistant surface vegetation, shaping the combined wave-tide boundary layer on the platforms, both traps and binds tidally introduced mineral sediment, but also contributes an organic component of indigenous origin to the deposit. When sea-level becomes stable or falls, however, in response to century-millennial scale fluctuations, the organic sediment component becomes dominant and mineralogenic marshes are transformed into organogenic ones. Organogenic marshes normally display a considerable range of sub-environments which create much spatial variation in the peat facies which accumulate. At an advanced stage, domed raised bogs , rising significantly above the general landscape, may appear on the marshes. Because peat is such a porous and permeable sediment, and there is little or no tidal inundation, organogenic marshes in Northwest Europe typically lack surface channels for internal drainage. The stratigraphic sequences accumulated during the Holocene beneath coastal marshes and high tidal flats typically present an alternation on a vertical scale of decimetres to metres of silts (mineralogenic marshes, high intertidal mudflats) and peats (organogenic highest intertidal-supratidal marshes). Coastal barriers and some channels are represented by local accumulations of sand and/or gravel. The silts and peats form couplets which are generally considered to be related to fluctuations of sea-level about the general upward trend. Field investigations and modelling show that, in areas where marshes are mature, the upward change from an organogenic to a sequence of mineralogenic marshes (transgressive overlaps) is accompanied by the initiation and invasive development of a branching network of tidal creeks. These decay and infill during the reversal of the environmental sequence and the approach, expressed as a series of regressive overlaps, of the next set of peat-forming conditions. The operation of the continuous, progressive, irreversible and asymptotic process of sediment autocompaction exerts a major, secondary control on depositional regimes and marsh behaviour. A variety of local responses are consequently possible in an extensive marsh, even though the marsh may be everywhere in dynamic equilibrium with environmental factors. Autocompaction also strongly shapes the character of Holocene coastal sequences as now perceived, introducing significant stratigraphic distortions and displacements which, for the time being, limit the accuracy of sea-level curves and rates of sea-level change based on dated intercalated peats. Prehistoric humans benefitted from the resources of coastal salt marshes, especially at the times when peat marshes begin to be transgressed. Peat domes not yet fully collapsed may have provided vantage points for seasonal ocupancy or even settlement from which the richer resource of the mineralogenic marshes developing on lower ground could be exploited. Increasing human interference on salt marshes over the last millennium, chiefly through wholesale land-claim and set-back, augmented by rising sea levels and continuing autocompaction, has led to a variety of poorly understood but generally deleterious effects in the lowland coastal zone. These include major changes to tidal and sedimentary regimes. ]"

Molecular taxonomic studies confirmed the distribution of these species and further studies at the population level are warranted, as there are possibilities to erect 6 new species. Gulf of Mannar, Palk Bay, Andaman and Nicobar, Lakshadweep islands and Gulf of Kutch are the major seagrass areas characterized by unique ecological variation. Though there is no comprehensive study on the seagrass associated floral and faunal composition in the country, about 1250 species of flora and fauna including endangered dugong and green turtles are reported from this fragile ecosystem. Ecology, productivity and biomass of seagrass of the country are well documented at major seagrass sites leaving the other minor seagrass areas least studied. Mapping of seagrass in Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands and Tamilnadu coast are well documented but holistic mapping of seagrass in the entire country is still not attempted.

The heterogeneity of the reservoirs related to depositional and diagenetic processes is illustrated. The heterogeneity results in a compartmentalization of the reservoirs at various scales. , High-frequency clastic shelf sequences contain porous deposits, consisting of coastal to shallow-water sandstones and conglomerates, which may represent very good reservoirs, and therefore critical targets for exploration and production, as well as for fluid (hydrocarbon, water or CO 2 ) storage. The study of these reservoirs, following a sequence stratigraphic approach, is essential to predict their features and distribution within systems tracts forming high-frequency sequences, which in turn compose higher-rank systems tracts and sequences. A critical aspect to improve the exploitability of the reservoirs is their heterogeneity, which directly affects the volume of the reservoirs and determine internal compartmentalization . The heterogeneity can be primary, related to depositional processes influencing grain size and facies distribution, and secondary, related to diagenesis . In particular, the primary heterogeneity is referred to the facies variability from distal to proximal settings, to the accumulation of condensed shell beds, and to facies characteristics of bedsets, whereas the secondary heterogeneity derives from diagenetic processes at sequence stratigraphic surfaces and facies contacts, and within sandbodies. Both the distribution of reservoirs and their heterogeneity can be predicted following a high-resolution sequence stratigraphic approach. Ultimately, the integration of subsurface data with the analysis of outcrop analogs is essential to better understand the features of clastic shelf reservoirs and to develop 3D models of fluid migration. ]"

This approach has proven successful in gaining community acceptance and achieving local-scale fisheries and conservation objectives. However, the contribution of these MPAs to ecologically connected networks of MPAs is variable since most MPAs were not designed to be parts of networks. Nevertheless, there is growing support for the development of MPAs within the national integrated coastal management framework which supports the “scaling up” of MPAs to establish networks. Scaling up in the Philippine context is achieved by forging inter-institutional collaboration among neighboring local governments (i.e. village to provincial level), with the assistance of other institutions such as non-government organizations, academe, government agencies, and development partners including donors. Herein we review the history of MPAs in the Philippines and the development of inter-institutional collaborations and present examples of scaling up of MPAs to form networks.

Here we use a transient climate simulation of the last deglaciation and a synthesis of hydroclimate proxies from across the continent to broadly assess the moisture budget and its evolution, including the primary components and mechanisms for changes, and evaluate the level of agreement between model and data in order to inform areas of major discrepancy for attention in future work. At the broadest scale, the simulation indicates that North America was wetter than modern through much of the last deglaciation, with the exception of the Pacific Northwest. This was principally due to increased moisture convergence by the mean flow over the west of the continent, and by transient eddies over the east. We find that the simulation demonstrates considerable skill in comparison to proxy records in the coastal Southwest and Pacific Northwest, with limited success in other regions. The highest disagreement occurs in the North-central region, where the model and data disagree on the sign of changes. In addition, we find that the areas of agreement coincide with regions whose hydroclimate is dominated by winter precipitation, while regions of disagreement are those where summer precipitation is predominant, and where the model suggests dynamical changes are important. These results illustrate the impact of the ice sheet on the atmospheric dynamics , and therefore the importance of its accurate reconstruction, as well as that of model resolution. Our analysis and synthesis provide context for future transient climate simulations, and suggest numerous areas of priority for future research. ]"

The dynamical mechanisms by which the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) interacts with the surrounding oceans in the model and real oceans are discussed. The focus is on the variability on timescales ranging from the intraseasonal (&lt;3 months) to the interannual (a few years). A lagged multiple regression technique is applied to anomalies of sea level from a mean seasonal cycle for observed and modeled fields. The results reveal that the region comprises the intersection of two ocean wave guides where sea level and upper ocean temperature anomalies can be largely understood in terms of Kelvin and Rossby waves generated by remote zonal winds along the Indian and Pacific equators , with local wind forcing appearing to play a minor role in generating interannual variability. Variations in zonal Pacific equatorial winds force a response along the Arafura/Australian shelf break through Pacific equatorial Rossby waves exciting coastally trapped waves off the western tip of Irian Jaya, which propagate westward into the Banda Sea and poleward along the Australian west coast. Equatorial Kelvin waves excited by Indian Ocean winds propagate eastward and scatter into coastal waves along the Sumatra–Java–Lesser Sunda coasts to penetrate the western internal seas of Indonesia. While the model captures the variability generated by the equatorial Indian Ocean winds, its pathway eastward into the Indonesian region is prevented by a dynamically “wide” Lombok Strait, which carries too much of the main throughflow and allows too little wave energy to pass directly into the Banda Sea. The model response to El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) wind changes is too weak as expressed by its sea-level response in the western Pacific. The subsequent transmission of this ENSO signal into the ITF region and along the west coast of Australia is also much weaker in the model than observed. Generally, the model/data comparisons suggest that too little energy gets scattered into the model coastal wave guide. An assessment of whether this difference is a model resolution or model dissipation issue (and they are related) needs further work. ]"

Since the Neoproterozoic, its tectonic evolution was constrained by successive consumption-closure processes of the Paleo-South China, Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, and Paleo-Pacific oceans. Studies suggest that this block was initially formed by the Neoproterozoic assembly of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks following the subduction-accretion of the Paleo-South China Ocean. Then after, it experienced three tectonic-magmatic events in the Phanerozoic . Among these events, the Late Mesozoic tectonism-magmatism was linked with the consumption of the Paleo-Pacific Ocean, while the Silurian and Early to Middle Triassic events took place in intracontinental settings that were related to far-field effects of the closure of the remote Proto-Tethys and Paleo-Tethys oceans, respectively. The subduction-accretion of the Paleo-South China Ocean, and collision at 980–820 Ma between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks formed the Jiangnan Orogenic Belt and the Proto-South China Continent, followed by a rifting tectonics and bimodal volcanism at 810–760 Ma. From 760 Ma to 460 Ma, the South China Block was situated under shore, shallow sea to slope depositional environments . During Late Ordovician to Early Devonian (460–400 Ma), an intracontinental orogeny occurred mainly in the Cathaysia Block as a response to the closure of the Proto-Tethys Ocean. Shortly afterwards, this block underwent a stable carbonate deposition during Early Devonian- Middle Triassic (400–230 Ma) and was thus under a shore or shallow sea environment. In the Middle-Late Triassic (240–220 Ma), the South China Block was affected by the closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, intracontinental deformation and S-type granitic magmatism .

Additional local entry points of sand do exist at the edges of the desert, and were quantified by comparison with detrital modes and heavy-mineral suites of hinterland-river sediments. After long-distance fluvial transport, Orange sand is washed by ocean waves and dragged northwards by vigorous longshore currents. Under the incessant action of southerly winds, sand is blown inland and carried farther north to accumulate in the Namib erg , a peculiar wind-dominated sediment sink displaced hundreds of kilometres away from the river mouth. And yet changes in sand mineralogy along the way are minor. After a multistep journey of cumulative 3000 km from their source in Lesotho, volcanic rock fragments and pyroxene are found in unchanged abundance as far as the northern edge of the desert. Only locally is volcanic detritus slightly depleted and minor but regular enrichment in quartz and garnet is observed, the sole potential effect of prolonged transport or recycling of Tertiary aeolianites. Selective comminution of fragile minerals is thus proved unable to substantially modify sand composition in fluvial, coastal, or aeolian settings. Mechanical processes have a much greater effect on the morphology of detrital grains, which in Namib dunes appear commonly shaped into nearly perfect spheres. Aeolian sorting concentrates denser minerals locally in placer lags, but such effects can be identified and compensated for. This study demonstrates that mechanical breakdown is unable to markedly affect provenance signatures even during long-distance and prolonged multistep transport in high-energy settings. In arid climates, where chemical processes are negligible, high-resolution bulk-petrography and heavy-mineral analyses are thus powerful techniques to quantitatively reconstruct provenance, and to trace sediment sources and dispersal paths over distances up to thousands of kilometres. ]"

This model depicts a change from a rollback subduction geometry in which extensional basins were developing in the overriding plate from ca. 1.67–1.604 Ga to a flat-slab subduction environment where ca. 1.65–1.604 Ga arc-magmatism was shut off and hot, extensional basins were inverted under high-temperature/low-pressure metamorphic conditions. The change in subduction architecture was induced by the arrival of a buoyant oceanic plateau at the site of subduction at ca. 1.604 Ga. Subduction was associated with the development of F-rich, S-poor metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) as the result of slab melting within the rollback and/or the flat-slab subduction geodynamic setting. Eclogitisation and densification of the frontal oceanic slab resulted in slab steepening, a sudden upwelling of hot asthenosphere under the present-day Olympic Dam area and transient upper crustal uplift. The sudden heat input triggered slab melting and partial melting in the mantle to produce anhydrous, F-rich, S-poor melts that interacted with the metasomatized SCLM. Fractionation of resultant mafic melts with minimal to no crustal input resulted in generation of the dominantly A-type older Hiltaba Suite granites that were emplaced at upper crustal levels and an ignimbrite flare-up that is now recognised as the Gawler Range Volcanics. Highly fractionated magma that stalled in the upper crust exsolved volatile-rich and metalliferous fluids that mixed with meteoric and basinal brines to produce IOCG mineralization through the Olympic Domain including the supergiant Olympic Dam deposit. Further slab steepening and retreat of the posterior buoyant oceanic plateau resulting in additional upwelling of the asthenosphere and progressive development of an asthenospheric wedge in a normal subduction geometry. Slab retreat can be tracked by the progressive younging of Hiltaba Suite granites in a present-day approximately westerly to southwesterly direction. Heat introduced through progressive development of the asthenospheric wedge resulted in dehydration of the buoyant oceanic lithosphere to produce S-rich fluids that interacted with the asthenosphere to produce oxidised, S-rich partial melts. These melts interacted with the metasomatized SCLM resulting in generation of dominantly I-type magmas and porphyry-epithermal systems in the southwestern Gawler Craton (Central Gawler Gold Province). The location of IOCG and porphyry-epithermal deposits is also dictated by the location of lithospheric-scale structures that acted as conduits for fluids and melts associated with mineralization. The suprasubduction zone environment of mineralization is informed by modern analogues of the Late Cretaceous to Early Eocene Laramide Orogeny in the western United States, present-day slab geometries in the Andes of South America, and by the formation of Cretaceous IOCG and Cu-porphyry deposits in the Chilean Coastal Cordillera . ]"

A model involving five main phases of colonization of desert environments through the Phanerozoic is proposed in this paper. The first phase (Cambrian–Silurian) involved animal incursions into coastal dune fields directly from the sea, although it is unlikely that these animals would have remained for long periods of time in coastal deserts. The second phase (Devonian) reflects the activities of dune pioneers that left their fluvial habitat to enter temporary or permanently into inland deserts. The third phase (Carboniferous–Permian) involved the colonization of deserts by tetrapods. The fourth phase (Triassic–Cretaceous) involved a major exploitation of the infaunal ecospace as reflected by the appearance of more varied behavioral patterns in sub-superficial structures. The fifth phase (Paleogene–Recent) reflects the appearance of the ecological dynamic that characterizes modern desert communities.

Trace-fossil distribution can be understood as reflecting the partitioning of desert settings in a mosaic of landscape units, characterized by water content and its temporal fluctuations, nutrient availability, nature of the substrate, and the dominant organisms present. In turn, desert systems are dynamic entities that change as a response to regional climate. Landscape units, such as eolian sand seas, salt flat and playa lake systems, ephemeral rivers and alluvial fans , interact in response to regional-scale climate variations in hyper-arid, arid, and semiarid climatic settings. Ancient deserts completely developed under hyper-arid climatic conditions rarely preserve trace fossils due to the absence of moisture near the surface. However, the alternation of wet periods may represent windows for life development and thus, preservation of biogenic structures . Arid deserts display complex patterns of dunes combined with dry, wet, and flooded interdunes. Dry desert elements (e.g. dunes, interdunes, sand sheets) typically record the Entradichnus–Octopodichnus and Chelichnus Ichnofacies. Slight rises in regional precipitation produce elevation of the water table and increase of fluvial discharges that provide water and sediment to the system. These processes may result in the local concentration of trace fossils in wet interdunes and ephemeral fluvial systems, illustrating the Scoyenia and Chelichnus Ichnofacies. In semiarid systems playa lakes expand by the addition of freshwater, evolving into freshwater lakes, and fluvial systems may become more common; lake margins and fluvial overbanks typically contain trace-fossil assemblages that may be ascribed to the Scoyenia Ichnofacies. ]"

Mangrove forests underpin ecosystem health and biodiversity of entire estuary. Threats from sea-level rise, land clearing and catchment pollutants. New techniques to monitor ecosystem stressors and function. , The tropical, macro-tidal estuary of Darwin Harbour is in near-pristine condition and supports a rich biodiversity. However, urban and industrial development pressures are increasing in many parts of the catchment. This challenges us to improve our understanding of how the harbour’s ecosystem responds to environmental threats and how best to optimise future development while preserving valuable ecosystem services. Here, we synthesise our current knowledge of several environmental aspects of the harbour and its catchment. The intertidal zone and its abundant mangrove forests account for a major proportion of primary productivity in Darwin Harbour. These areas also play a key role in preserving water quality by intercepting catchment-derived pollutants and they substantially influence the movement of sediment through the estuary. Darwin Harbour mangroves generally remain in healthy condition with extensive areas of highly biodiverse habitats near urban and industrial developments. The future health of Darwin Harbour depends substantially on the protection of the mangrove estate against further pressures from coastal land clearing, catchment derived pollutants and accelerated sedimentation from runoff and dredging . Rapid sea level rise (currently ≈ ≈ 8 mm/year) is a further significant threat to the stratified floristic assemblages and specialised invertebrate fauna typical of Darwin Harbour mangrove forests. These threats require development of new sensitive harbour-wide monitoring techniques to provide early warning of the excess accumulation of stressors and disruption to ecosystem functioning. ]"

However, the impacts of potentially harmful microorganisms and pathogens colonising plastic litter are not well understood. The hard surface of plastics provides an ideal environment for opportunistic microbial colonisers to form biofilms and might offer a protective niche capable of supporting a diversity of different microorganisms, known as the “Plastisphere”. This biotope could act as an important vector for the persistence and spread of pathogens, faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) and harmful algal bloom species (HABs) across beach and bathing environments.

Initial conditions and plant traits activate different feedbacks at different sites. Longitudinal patches and parallel drainage arise from multiscale stress divergence. High sinuosities in low gradients arise from deposition stabilized by vegetation. Runaway positive feedbacks from small to large scale trigger rapid marsh loss. , Low-gradient fluvial landscapes (1–50 cm km −1 ) occupy diverse settings (inland, tidal, and deltaic wetlands, large-river floodplains, lowland streams) but share many commonalities. Because of low flow energies, these landscapes have abundant vegetation that is submersed or frequently inundated. Their sediment loads are predominantly fine, with large loads transported in suspension. The complexities of fluvial-vegetation interactions and fine sediment transport have made these landscapes relatively poorly studied in the field of geomorphology, yet the importance of understanding their dynamics is paramount: these landscapes will be among the first inundated by rising seas and/or are presently the focus of the world's largest restoration projects. In this synthesis, interactions between flow, vegetation, and sediment documented in inland and tidal marshes, chalk and Coastal Plain streams, large river floodplains, and deltas are reviewed and classified into feedback processes occurring over a range of five spatiotemporal scales. Despite different morphologic appearances, the feedback processes governing the coevolution of landscapes and vegetation are broadly consistent across settings, though modified in their effects by life-history traits of vegetation, characteristics of the sediment supply, external boundary forcing, and initial conditions. Longitudinally elongated patches are common in many settings, arising from stress divergence feedbacks. However, their ultimate morphology is strongly dependent upon the activation of patch- or multipatch-scale feedbacks, which depends on initial densities at the time of colonization. Generally, flow-vegetation-sediment feedbacks play a dominant role in landscape morphology when the setting is depositional and little initial topographic differentiation is present. In that case, these feedbacks can explain the apparently paradoxical emergence of high sinuosities or parallel drainage in very low gradients. Importantly for management, flow-vegetation-sediment interactions may activate a chain of positive feedbacks that engages progressively larger scales, resulting in massive destruction of marsh vegetation or topographic homogenization. Interrupting these feedbacks requires intervention over all scales activated. ]"

Increasingly, however, population growth exposes more people to risks as cities spread and as land use must intensify. These social features interact with a heterogeneous distribution of seismic risks shaped by the way the Nazca plate subducts, causing earthquakes to occur throughout the mountains and on the coast, with active volcanoes in the south. Landscapes are shaped not only by catastrophic events such as landslides, but also by soil erosion and fluvial transport. In Peru, rains and floods during an El Niño year can rearrange surface features, in addition to destroying houses and infrastructure. Even if people perceive, recognize, and acknowledge the presence of risks from these natural hazards, they are often constrained in the way they can or will respond. Vulnerabilities in Peru to natural hazards are amplified by poverty and by a disconnection between what science can predict and what people will do. ]"

Despite increasing availability, existing GALC datasets cannot satisfy user needs. A comprehensive GALC mapping framework was proposed to serve various users. This framework can grow from evolving satellite data and technological advancements. Operational GALC mapping should be bridged with generic land cover monitoring. , Aquatic land cover represents the land cover type that is significantly influenced by the presence of water over an extensive part of a year. Monitoring global aquatic land cover types plays an essential role in preserving aquatic ecosystems and maintaining the ecosystem service they provide for humans, while at the same time their accurate and consistent monitoring for multiple purposes (e.g. climate modelling, biodiversity conservation, water resource management) remains challenging. Although a number of global aquatic land cover (GALC) datasets are available for use to monitor aquatic ecosystems, there are prominent variabilities among these datasets, which is primarily caused by the inconsistency between different land versus water-related monitoring approaches and characterization schemes. As aquatic land cover exists in many different forms on Earth (e.g. wetland, open water) and can be mapped by different approaches, it is necessary to consider a much more consistent and comprehensive characterization framework that not only ensures the consistency in the monitoring of aquatic land cover but also serves the needs of multiple users (e.g. climate users, agricultural users) interested in different aspects of aquatic lands. In this study, we addressed this issue by 1) reviewing 33 GALC datasets and user needs identified from the citing papers of current datasets and international conventions, policies and agreements in relation to aquatic ecosystems, 2) proposing a global characterization framework for aquatic land cover based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) classifier principles and the identified user needs, and 3) highlighting the opportunities and challenges provided by remote sensing techniques for the implementation of the proposed framework. Results show that users require or prefer various kinds of information on aquatic types including vegetation type, water persistence, the artificiality of cover (i.e. artificial vs natural), water salinity , and the accessibility to the sea (i.e. coastal vs inland). Datasets with medium to high spatial resolution , intra-annual dynamics and inter-annual changes are needed by many users. However, none of the existing datasets can meet all these requirements and a rigorous quantitative accuracy assessment is lacking to evaluate its quality for most of the GALC datasets. The proposed framework has three levels and users are allowed to derive their aquatic land cover types of interest by combining different levels and classifiers of information. This comprehensive mapping framework can help to bridge the gap between user needs and current GALC datasets as well as the gap between generic and aquatic land cover monitoring. The implementation of the framework can benefit from evolving satellite-data availability, improved computation capability and open-source machine learning algorithms, although at the same time it faces challenges mainly coming from the complexity of aquatic ecosystems. The framework proposed in this study provides insights for future operational aquatic land cover monitoring initiatives and will support better understanding and monitoring of complex aquatic ecosystems. ]"

Great challenges include robust management models of these AR environments. , It is presented a systematic literature review of artificial reef research, including 620 studies throughout the world from 1962 to 2018. The primary focus of this study was to examine long-term trends in research, focusing on ecological and socioeconomic questions, and to develop new research directions for this field. From 1962 to the beginning of the 1990s, the United States and Japan were the main centers of artificial reef research. Subsequently, researchers in several other countries (particularly China, Australia, Italy, Brazil, and the United Kingdom) began to focus on this subject, resulting in an increase in the number of artificial reef studies. In general, publications about artificial reefs have concentrated on investigating the structure of populations and marine communities and evaluating new technical designs and materials to construct artificial habitats. The science of artificial reefs is responding to new challenges with an increase in more elaborate techniques, such as the use of remotely-operated submarines, organic indicators, isotopes, and molecular biology , while research that evaluates the socioeconomic aspects of artificial reefs is lacking. There are many aspects that deserve more research attention, such as the use of alternative inert materials, environmental impact assessment and mitigation, and analysis of conflicts with affected fisheries communities.

A set of 10-tenets is given for sustainable marine management of hazard and risk. We emphasise merging natural &amp; societal aspects to minimise hazards &amp; risks. , This paper illustrates a typology of 14 natural and anthropogenic hazards, the evidence for their causes and consequences for society and their role as vectors of change in estuaries , vulnerable coasts and marine areas. It uses hazard as the potential that there will be damage to the natural or human system and so is the product of an event which could occur and the probability of it occurring whereas the degree of risk then relates to the amount of assets, natural or societal, which may be affected. We give long- and short-term and large- and small-scale perspectives showing that the hazards leading to disasters for society will include flooding, erosion and tsunamis. Global examples include the effects of wetland loss and the exacerbation of problems by building on vulnerable coasts. Hence we emphasise the importance of considering hazard and risk on such coasts and consider the tools for assessing and managing the impacts of risk and hazard. These allow policy-makers to determine the consequences for natural and human systems. We separate locally-derived problems from large-scale effects (e.g. climate change, sea-level rise and isostatic rebound); we emphasise that the latter unmanaged exogenic pressures require a response to the consequences rather than the causes whereas within a management area there are endogenic managed pressures in which we address both to causes and consequences. The problems are put into context by assessing hazards and the conflicts between different uses and users and hence the management responses needed. We emphasise that integrated and sustainable management of the hazards and risk requires 10-tenets to be fulfilled. ]"

In late 2015, a review was undertaken to examine the body of literature regarding the Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) of the world. Trends in the literature were studied to explore this approach as a means for implementing ecosystem-based management of coastal and marine resources, with the objective of providing guidance for filling gaps in the scientific literature supporting this concept. Since 1995, there has been an increase in the number of peer-reviewed, scientific journal articles related to the LME approach, termed “LME articles.” Based on this review, we observed that between 1983 and early 2016, 392 LME journal articles were published. In the examined literature, there is a strong focus on fisheries and fisheries-related considerations and concerns, with 59% of the most relevant journal articles focused on fish or fisheries. Future publications should draw on the experience of past and current LME projects to inform and provide tools for future projects to address the socioeconomic aspects of implementing ecosystem-based management.

Organic sediments include a significant proportion of organic compounds of marine and/or continental origin. In the ocean, organic compounds are for the most part produced by living organisms, which are principally concentrated in the photic zone and the contribution of phytoplankton dominates over that of zooplankton, nekton , and benthos . Organic compounds of continental origin are for the most part derived from vegetation and soils. Organic matter is, therefore, more abundant in oceanic regions of important biological activity such as upwelling and divergence areas.

Sediments commonly present significant and variable concentrations of pollutants. Conventional sediment treatment has traditionally focused on pollutant removal . Circular Economy aims to reduce pollutants, reduce impacts and recover by-products. Circularity must overcome technical and sociopolitical barriers for its development. , Dredging is an essential technique to maintain proper water depths in ports and bays. Many dredged sediments are considered as toxic waste due to their significant amounts of metals and other pollutants. In consequence, they need to be treated to reduce this toxicity and avoid pollutant resuspensions. Physical operations and chemical, thermal and biological processes have been conventionally used to this aim, but the traditional linear sediment approach is often unsustainable and economically and environmentally demanding. Considering the increasing people’s awareness in environmental issues, more efficient dredged sediment management schemes are required. Some authors are making significant efforts to improve circularity in sediment management processes by taking advantage of the mineral composition of sediments to obtain products for the building and road construction sectors, therefore decreasing the need of raw materials while reducing the amounts of sediments wasted to landfills. However, information related to the characteristics of these products, their mechanical behaviour and their functionality is still scarce, being sediment-based by-products developed mainly at low Technological Readiness Level (TRL), showing low global impact in the market. To implement circular economy in the dredged sediment sector, some technical and socio-political barriers must be still overcome. To this aim, further research and technological applications must be developed, with the support of decision makers and stakeholders.

One of the most important environmental issues and economic burdens of industrial mining on land is the safe storage of the vast amounts of waste produced.

Rip currents are ubiquitous on wave-exposed coasts. Each year they cause hundreds of drowning deaths and tens of thousands of rescues on beaches worldwide and are therefore the leading deadly hazard to recreational beach users. The broad definition above masks considerable natural variability in terms of rip current occurrence in time and space, flow characteristics and behaviour. In particular, surf-zone rip currents have long been perceived as narrow flows extending well beyond the breakers, flushing out the surf zone at a high rate (‘exit flow’ circulation regime), while more recent studies have shown that rip flow patterns can consist of quasi-steady semi-enclosed vortices retaining most of the floating material within the surf zone (‘circulatory flow’ circulation regime). Building upon a growing body of rip current literature involving numerical modelling and theory together with emergence of dense Lagrangian field measurements, we develop a robust rip current type classification that provides a relevant framework to understand the primary morphological and hydrodynamic parameters controlling surf-zone rip current occurrence and dynamics. Three broad categories of rip current types are described based on the dominant controlling forcing mechanism. Each category is further divided into two types owing to different physical driving mechanisms for a total of six fundamentally different rip current types: hydrodynamically-controlled (1) shear instability rips and (2) flash rips, which are transient in both time and space and occur on alongshore-uniform beaches; bathymetrically-controlled (3) channel rips and (4) focused rips, which occur at relatively fixed locations and are driven by hydrodynamic processes forced by natural alongshore variability of the morphology in both the surf zone and inner shelf zone; and boundary-controlled (5) deflection rips and (6) shadow rips, which flow against rigid lateral boundaries such as natural headlands or anthropogenic structures. For each rip current type, flow response to changes in hydrodynamic and morphologic forcing magnitude is examined in regard to velocity modulation and changes in circulation regime, providing key force-response relationships of rip currents. We also demonstrate that in the real world, rip currents form through a mixture of driving mechanisms and the discrete rip types defined in fact form key elements in a wide and complex spectrum of rip currents on natural beaches. It is anticipated that this rip current type classification will serve as a resource for coastal scientists and non-specialists with an interest in the rip current hazard, and as a platform for future rip current studies. Finally, we suggest some important future research directions highlighting the need for coastal and beach safety communities to collaborate in order to improve rip current education and awareness. ]"

A sequence of beach ridges, coupled with their subsurface deposits, can be regarded as a time series of coastal evolution . Methodological advances in field surveying and chronology applicable to beach ridges have led to detailed palaeoenvironmental reconstructions to be derived from such sequences. This paper reconsiders the basic aspects of beach ridges and deposits, which need to be properly understood for their comprehensive interpretation in a palaeo-environmental context. It also reviews case studies in which beach-ridge sequences have been used to unveil past sea-level history, catastrophic events, and climate changes. Proposed formative processes of beach ridges include: 1) progradation of sandy beach and berm formations in relation to fairweather waves, coupled with aeolian foredune accumulation; 2) building of gravel ridges by storm waves; 3) welding of longshore bars. Beach-ridge formation through sea-level oscillation is thought to be questionable and caution is suggested for this process when undertaking palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Beach deposit stratification is known to dip either landwards or seawards, but landward dips are uncommon. Seaward dipping stratification is formed in relation to beachface progradation, and is usually dissected in places by erosion surfaces resulting from episodic beach retreat. The boundary between the foreshore and the underlying shoreface is well defined only in the case that longshore bars lead to complex bedding structure relative to that of the foreshore. Reliable chronology of beach ridges can be determined by radiocarbon and optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. Radiocarbon dating of articulated shells, which are considered not to be extensively reworked, provides robust results, but OSL dating is more useful as it enables direct dating of sediment grains. It is noted that there are restrictions in chronological resolution and continuity inherent to beach ridge and beach deposits. The plan-view geomorphic expression of beach ridges typically consists of ridge sets with multi-decadal intervals, whereas their internal sedimentary structures define shorter time scales. Records of beach sedimentation and erosion are likely to be reworked by episodic high-magnitude beach retreat, and the resultant record of the net progradation is likely to be sporadic and discontinuous. The height of sandy beach ridges is often variable due to differing degrees of aeolian sand accumulation, and they are thus not used as sea-level indicators unless purely wave-built. Gravel ridge height is a relatively reliable indicator of sea level, but can vary in response to storminess fluctuations. Subsurface sediment facies boundaries are preferred as sea-level indicators, and those proposed include: boundaries of aeolian/beach, foreshore/shoreface, and upper/lower shorefaces. Catastrophic events are expressed in both erosional and depositional records. Erosion surfaces, or scarp imprints, revealed in a cross section of beach deposits, indicate storm or tsunami events. However, erosional events are likely to rework previous records of sedimentation and even other erosional events, and thus the apparent history decoded from the resultant deposits tends to be biased. Several attempts for estimating the frequency and intensity of prehistoric cyclones rely on assumed relationships between the level of coarse sand beach ridges and cyclone inundation. The formative process of coarse sand ridges remains uncertain and needs to be clarified, as it constitutes the fundamental basis of these attempts. The growth rates of beach-ridge systems are expected to reflect fluctuations in river sediment discharge to the coast and in aeolian sand flux due to onshore winds, both of which are affected by climate change. Assessment of the growth rate is potentially improved by ground-penetrating radar survey of subsurface structure and by detailed chronology. Orientation of beach ridges reflects long-term trends in wave direction. Inferred relationships between beach ridges and cyclic fluctuations of sea level and climate rely on weak assumptions and are not substantiated by rigid chronological evidence, and thus remain highly questionable. Correlation between the inherently decadal signal of beach-ridge intervals and possible climate cycles , such as sunspot activity, is probably coincidental as it lacks causal explanations. ]"

However, it remains unclear whether there exists a genetic link between the intraplate and subduction-related magmatism . Here we conduct a comprehensive geochemical data compilation, sorting and processing of the Cretaceous mafic igneous rocks from SE China, in combination with a 2-D numerical simulation on slab melting, to further decipher the petrogenetic relationship between the arc-type and intraplate magmatism under a unified tectonic framework invoking subduction and rollback-tearing of the paleo-Pacific Ocean. The Cretaceous arc-type mafic rocks (120–80 Ma) include eruptive and intrusive rocks, distributing along the coastal region in a NE-NNE direction. After parent magma compositional recalculation of the mafic intrusions, the results indicate that both the eruptive and intrusive arc-type mafic rocks are hydrous calc-alkaline basalts , with enrichments in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and light rare earth elements (LREEs) but depletions in high field strength elements (HFSEs), crust-like Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions , and low Lu/Hf ratios. All these features are typical of igneous rocks formed in a continental arc . The combined data suggest their mantle source was mainly metasomatized by melts derived from the subducted terrestrial sediments and reflect a relatively hot subduction zone during Cretaceous. The intraplate mafic rocks (110–70 Ma) distribute in SE China interior and generally show trace element geochemistry similar to oceanic island basalt (OIB, hereafter we term them as OIB-like basalts). They can be further divided into two groups: high-Nb (Nb &gt; 50 ppm) and low-Nb (Nb &lt; 40 ppm) basalts . The high-Nb basalts have depleted asthenospheric mantle-like isotopic compositions . Their mantle source was composed mainly of pyroxenite that was likely formed through interaction between the asthenosphere and melts from the dehydrated subducted slab. Relative to the high-Nb basalts, the low-Nb basalts have lower Nb/REE and Nb/LILE ratios, and more evolved but highly variable isotopic compositions. Their mantle source was also the asthenosphere metasomatized by addition of the slab melts containing a higher proportion of recycled sediment component. From the arc-type to low-Nb and ultimately to high-Nb mafic rocks, increases of Nb, Nb/LILE and Nb/REE ratios are coupled with more depleted Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic features, reflecting the occurrence of melting from the upper subducted sediment to the lower oceanic mafic crust that had experienced extensive dehydration. Further thermodynamic modelling results show that melting of the dehydrated slab can occur along the torn surface and lower part of the oceanic crust , once the slab is strongly thinned and fractured in response to tearing and fragmentation. In combination with the contemporaneous sedimentary records in SE China, the Cretaceous mafic magmatism provided geochemical records of tectonic transition from early Cretaceous advanced subduction to late Cretaceous rollback of the paleo-Pacific slab, during which slab tearing or fragmentation and the resultant melting of the dehydrated subducted slab acted as a predominant agent for mantle enrichment. ]"

However, OC turnover rates differ significantly owing to complex spatiotemporal variations in sediment depositional conditions. This review discusses the dominant methodologies through laboratory or in situ methods to measure oxygen consumption or dissolved inorganic carbon production rates to assess OC remineralization rates. The influencing factors in marine sediments are briefly described, including characteristics of OC interactions with the sediment matrix, redox effect, temperature, and biotic activities. Lastly, we provide a comparison of the OC remineralization rates among near-shore (0–50 m), continental shelf and slope (50–2000 m), deep sea (2000–6000 m), and trench (&gt;6000 m) sediments. The remineralization rates generally decreased with distance from the continent, excluding the trench region. While conditions such as redox oscillation, nutrient input, and temperature were severely influenced by global warming and human activities on large scales, reactions between OC and degradation functional genes of microorganisms helped to reveal the microbial scale of sedimentary OC remineralization. Thus, it is pivotal to understand both the processes of OC remineralization and the underlying mechanisms in marine sediments. ]"

De facto, such models have however a coarser resolution than the coastal model and the downscaling of the circulation to the high resolution grid is biased. Indeed the models are not necessarily based on the same physics and the interactions of the general circulation with the topography, in particular over the shelf break region, are generally not correctly represented on the large-scale grid. Studying the response of the Northern Current to the atmospheric forcing in the region of Marseille (France) and its interactions with the continental shelf break, we evaluate in this paper the spurious consequences at short and medium range that can result from a crude interpolation of basin scale model outputs to initialize and force along its open boundaries a high resolution coastal model.

Geochemistry is now a much more widely used proxy in tsunami research, mainly due to its increasingly recognised value in the identification of historical and/or prehistorical deposits, at times even providing the conclusive proof when other proxies are missing or equivocal, but also its significance in environmental impact assessments following recent tsunamis. The rapid advance in analytical techniques has also made it a more approachable and popular method, as it is now often faster and cheaper. Here we provide a review of the applications of geochemistry, including the techniques used, as well as a database of studies that used chemical proxies in their investigation of recent and old events, including onshore and offshore tsunami deposits . Chemical signatures are often used as markers of marine inundation, either as salinity indicators, where they can also allow the identification of the limit of tsunami inundation, or tracers of the incorporation of marine-sourced carbonates. Their applications as indicators of source material are nevertheless expanding, thereby potentially providing additional information on the hydrodynamic processes associated with tsunami inundation, although they are largely site-specific. The effects of post-depositional changes in different climatic regimes are examined, with a particular emphasis on water-leachable components and implications for post-event recovery of coastal ecosystems . We demonstrate the usefulness of chemical proxies in studies of the geological record of tsunamis extending back thousands of years, suggest new approaches and discuss limitations and existing knowledge gaps. ]"

Diurnal and annual cycles are the 1st/2nd modes over the IMC, in contrast to intraseasonal and interannual modes in open oceans. Rainfall is distributed along coastlines where the diurnal cycles are concentrated. Intraseasonal/annual/interannual variations of sea–land temperature gradient modulate the diurnal-cycle amplitude. The IMC with the world's longest coastline has the world's largest rainfall. , The Indonesian maritime continent (IMC) is a miniature of our land–sea coexisting planet Earth. Firstly, without interior activity, the Earth becomes an even-surfaced “aqua-planet” with both atmosphere and ocean flowing almost zonally, and solar differential heating generates (global thermal tides and) Hadley's meridional circulations with the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) along the equator as observed actually over the open (Indian and Pacific) oceans on the both sides of the IMC. The ITCZ involves intraseasonal variations or super cloud clusters moving eastward with hierarchical substructures moving also westward. Secondly, the lands and seas over the actual Earth have been keeping the area ratio of 3:7 (similar to that of islands and inland/surrounding seas in the IMC), but their displacements have produced the IMC near the equator, which turns equatorial Pacific easterly ocean current northward (Kuroshio) and reflects equatorial oceanic waves that affect coupled ocean–atmosphere interannual variations such as ENSO and IOD , or displacements of Walker's zonal circulations . Thirdly, because the IMC consists of many large/small islands with very long coastlines, many narrow straits control the global (Pacific to Indian) ocean circulation, and the land-sea heat capacity contrasts along the coastlines generate the world's largest rainfall with diurnal cycles (sea–land breeze circulations). The diurnal cycles are dominant even in the rainy season (austral summer in Jawa and Bali), because rainfall-induced sprinkler-like land cooling reverses the trans-coastal temperature gradient before sunrise, and subsequent clear sky on land until around noon provides solar heating dependent on season. These processes lead to rapid land/hydrosphere-atmosphere water exchange, local air pollutant washout, and transequatorial boreal winter monsoon (cold surge). In El Niño years, for example, the cooler sea-surface temperature suppresses the morning coastal-sea rainfall, and induces often serious smog diffused from land over the IMC. Lastly, high-resolution observations/models covering both over islands and seas are necessary. A radar-profiler network (HARIMAU) has been constructed during FY2005–09, and capacity building on radar operations and buoy manufacturing has been promoted during FY2009–13 by Japan–Indonesia collaboration projects, which are taken over by an Indonesian national center (MCCOE) established in November 2013. Through these projects, variabilities of local circulations and precipitations with diurnal cycles have been recognized as important targets both in science and application. ]"

PMMoV is 100% sensitive to domestic wastewater and 90% specific, per published studies. PMMoV and pathogen co-detection rate is as high as 72% for waters exposed to raw sewage. PMMoV and pathogen co-detection rate is as high as 67% for waters exposed to treated sewage. PMMoV is an effective, conservative index virus for enteric viruses to assess water quality. , An enteric virus surrogate and reliable domestic wastewater tracer is needed to manage microbial quality of food and water as (waste)water reuse becomes more prevalent in response to population growth, urbanization, and climate change. Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), a plant pathogen found at high concentrations in domestic wastewater, is a promising surrogate for enteric viruses that has been incorporated into over 29 water- and food-related microbial quality and technology investigations around the world. This review consolidates the available literature from across disciplines to provide guidance on the utility of PMMoV as either an enteric virus surrogate and/or domestic wastewater marker in various situations. Synthesis of the available research supports PMMoV as a useful enteric virus process indicator since its high concentrations in source water allow for identifying the extent of virus log-reductions in field, pilot, and full-scale (waste)water treatment systems. PMMoV reduction levels during many forms of wastewater treatment were less than or equal to the reduction of other viruses, suggesting this virus can serve as an enteric virus surrogate when evaluating new treatment technologies. PMMoV excels as an index virus for enteric viruses in environmental waters exposed to untreated domestic wastewater because it was detected more frequently and in higher concentrations than other human viruses in groundwater (72.2%) and surface waters (freshwater, 94.5% and coastal, 72.2%), with pathogen co-detection rates as high as 72.3%. Additionally, PMMoV is an important microbial source tracking marker, most appropriately associated with untreated domestic wastewater, where its pooled-specificity is 90% and pooled-sensitivity is 100%, as opposed to human feces where its pooled-sensitivity is only 11.3%. A limited number of studies have also suggested that PMMoV may be a useful index virus for enteric viruses in monitoring the microbial quality of fresh produce and shellfish, but further research is needed on these topics. Finally, future work is needed to fill in knowledge gaps regarding PMMoV's global specificity and sensitivity. ]"

Daily proxy records for discharge since 2002 and for each of the 33 river systems can be derived with novel Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) methods. A descriptive framework based on analysis of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data is used to capture the major landscape-scale floodplain elements or zones: 1) container valleys with their long and narrow pathways of largely sediment transit and bypass, 2) floodplain depressions that act as loci for frequent flooding and sediment storage, 3) zones of nodal avulsions common to many continental scale rivers, and often located seaward of container valleys, and 4) coastal floodplains and delta plains that offer both sediment bypass and storage but under the influence of marine processes. The SRTM data allow mapping of smaller-scale architectural elements in unprecedented systematic manner. Floodplain depressions were found to play a major role, which may largely be overlooked in conceptual floodplain models. Lastly, MODIS data (independently and combined with AMSR-E) allows the tracking of flood hydrographs and pathways and sedimentation patterns on a near-daily timescale worldwide. These remote-sensing data show that 85% of the studied major river systems experienced extensive flooding in the last decade.

Volatilisation from marine and terrestrial sources is vital in iodine's global cycle. Plant uptake of iodine is limited. For most populations iodine intake derives from adventitious sources. A large percentage of the world population are at risk of iodine deficiency. , Iodine is an essential element in the human diet and a deficiency can lead to a number of health outcomes collectively termed iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). The geochemistry of iodine is dominated by its volatility with volatilisation of organo-iodine compounds and elemental iodine from biological and non-biological sources in the oceans being a major component of its global cycle. As a result of the dominant oceanic source, iodine is strongly enriched in near-coastal soils, however, the major zone of marine influence generally stretches to only 50–80 km inland and terrestrial sources of volatilised iodine, from wetlands, soils and plants are also an important aspect of its global geochemical cycle . Iodine in soils is strongly bound with transfer factors from soil to plants being generally small and as a consequence there is only limited uptake of iodine through the plant root system. It is likely that uptake of atmospheric iodine by the aerial parts of plants is an essential process and, along with iodine deposited on plant surfaces, is a major source for grazing animals. Human intake of iodine is mainly from food with some populations also obtaining appreciable quantities of iodine from drinking water. Plant-derived dietary iodine is generally insufficient as evidenced from the low dietary iodine of strict vegan diets. Seafood provides major iodine-rich dietary items but other inputs are mainly from adventitious sources, such as the use of iodised salt and from dairy produce, which is a rich source mainly due to cattle-feed being fortified with iodine, and to the use of iodine-containing sterilants in the dairy industry . While the distribution and geochemistry of iodine are reflected in the global distribution of IDD, the recent upsurge of IDD in developed countries would seem to reflect changes in diet. ]"

Machine learning (ML) methods can increase the efficiency of RS data. Different key features can be extracted by applying ML methods to RS data. Lithological units, alteration zones, and structures are from the key features. Recently developed ML methods have to be applied for mapping mineralization zones. , The decline of the number of newly discovered mineral deposits and increase in demand for different minerals in recent years has led exploration geologists to look for more efficient and innovative methods for processing different data types at each stage of mineral exploration. As a primary step, various features, such as lithological units, alteration types, structures, and indicator minerals, are mapped to aid decision-making in targeting ore deposits. Different types of remote sensing datasets, such as satellite and airborne data, make it possible to overcome common problems associated with mapping geological features. The rapid increase in the volume of remote sensing data obtained from different platforms has encouraged scientists to develop advanced, innovative, and robust data processing methodologies. Machine learning methods can help process a wide range of remote sensing datasets and determine the relationship between components such as the reflectance continuum and features of interest. These methods are robust in processing spectral and ground truth measurements against noise and uncertainties. In recent years, many studies have been carried out by supplementing geological surveys with remote sensing datasets, which is now prominent in geoscience research.

Here we present new sedimentological data from the Paleoarchean-early Mesoarchean eastern Iron Ore Group (EIOG) from the Singhbhum craton , India and critically synthesize the earlier published data to constrain the depositional setting of the EIOG succession. Two distinct facies associations characterize the EIOG succession: while the lower facies association is marine and indicates initial shallowing and subsequent deepening of the sea level, the upper facies association is terrestrial (alluvial fan-fluvial) with an unconformable lower contact. The upper facies association formed because of continental emersion at around 3300 Ma. The ultramafic (komatiite)-mafic (minor felsic) volcanic rocks indicate mantle plume activity and crustal contamination . Carbon isotopic analysis of the carbonaceous matter (CM) preserved within the lower facies association reveals that these are syngenetic with the host rock without any evidence of migration of bitumen and modern organic contamination.

The major advances achieved in this period are: Meteorological databases are now available to the research community, partly as station data, with a growing number of freely available gridded datasets on decadal and centennial time scales. The free availability of meteorological datasets supports the development of more accurate forcing functions for Baltic Sea models. In the last decade, oceanographic data have become much more accessible and new important measurement platforms, such as FerryBoxes and satellites, have provided better temporally and spatially resolved observations. Our understanding of how large-scale atmospheric circulation affects the Baltic Sea climate, particularly in winter, has improved. Internal variability is strong illustrating the dominant stochastic behaviour of the atmosphere. The heat and water cycles of the Baltic Sea are better understood. The importance of surface waves in air–sea interaction is better understood, and Stokes drift and Langmuir circulation have been identified as likely playing an important role in surface water mixing in sea water. We better understand sea ice dynamics and thermodynamics in the coastal zone where sea ice interaction between land and sea is crucial. The Baltic Sea’s various straits and sills are of increasing interest in seeking to understand water exchange and mixing. There has been increased research into the Baltic Sea coastal zone, particularly into upwelling, in the past decade. Modelling of the Baltic Sea–North Sea system, including the development of coupled land–sea–atmosphere models, has improved. Despite marked progress in Baltic Sea research over the last decade, several gaps remain in our knowledge and understanding. The current understanding of salinity changes is limited, and future projections of salinity evolution are uncertain. In addition, modelling of the hydrological cycle in atmospheric climate models is severely biased. More detailed investigations of regional precipitation and evaporation patterns (including runoff), atmospheric variability, highly saline water inflows, exchange between sub-basins, circulation, and especially turbulent mixing are still needed. Furthermore, more highly resolved oceanographic models are necessary. In addition, models that incorporate more advanced carbon cycle and ecosystem descriptions and improved description of water–sediment interactions are needed. There is also a need for new climate projections and simulations with improved atmospheric and oceanographic coupled model systems. These and other research challenges are addressed by the recently formed Baltic Earth research programme, the successor of the BALTEX programme, which ended in 2013. Baltic Earth will treat anthropogenic changes and impacts together with their natural drivers. Baltic Earth will serve as a network for earth system sciences in the region, following in the BALTEX tradition but in a wider context. ]"

An understanding of the fate of nitrate in groundwater is vital for managing risks associated with nitrate pollution, and to safeguard groundwater supplies and groundwater-dependent surface waters. Denitrification is focused upon as the dominant nitrate attenuation process in groundwater. As denitrifying bacteria are essentially ubiquitous in the subsurface, the critical limiting factors are oxygen and electron donor concentration and availability. Variability in other environmental conditions such as nitrate concentration, nutrient availability, pH, temperature, presence of toxins and microbial acclimation appears to be less important, exerting only secondary influences on denitrification rates. Other nitrate depletion mechanisms such as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and assimilation of nitrate into microbial biomass are unlikely to be important in most subsurface settings relative to denitrification. Further research is recommended to improve current understanding on the influence of organic carbon, sulphur and iron electron donors, physical restrictions on microbial activity in dual porosity aquifers, influences of environmental condition (e.g. pH in poorly buffered environments and salinity in coastal or salinized soil settings), co-contaminant influences (particularly the contrasting inhibitory and electron donor influences of pesticides) and improved quantification of denitrification rates in the laboratory and field. ]"

Preliminary measurements indicate maximum runup values of around 17 m (Okal et al., 2010) and shore-normal inundation distances of up to ~ 620 m (Jaffe et al., 2010). Geological field reconnaissance studies were conducted as part of an UNESCO-IOC International Tsunami Survey Team survey within three weeks of the event in order to document the erosion, transport, and deposition of sediment by the tsunami. Data collected included: a) general morphology and geological characteristics of the coast, b) evidence of tsunami flow (inundation, flow depth and direction, wave height and runup), c) surficial and subsurface sediment samples including deposit thickness and extent, d) topographic mapping, and e) boulder size and location measurements. Four main types of sedimentary deposits were identified: a) gravel fields consisting mostly of isolated cobbles and boulders, b) sand sheets from a few to ~ 25 cm thick, c) piles of organic (mostly vegetation) and man-made material forming debris ramparts, and d) surface mud deposits that settled from suspension from standing water in the tsunami aftermath.

Here we review the impacts of settled and suspended sediment on sponges. Sediment has generally negative impacts on sponges. Specific adaptations allow sponges to survive and often thrive in sediment habitats. Further research on early life stages, adaptations and tolerance limits is required. , Changes in sediment input to marine systems can influence benthic environments in many ways. Sponges are important components of benthic ecosystems world-wide and as sessile suspension feeders are likely to be impacted by changes in sediment levels. Despite this, little is known about how sponges respond to changes in settled and suspended sediment. Here we review the known impacts of sedimentation on sponges and their adaptive capabilities, whilst highlighting gaps in our understanding of sediment impacts on sponges. Although the literature clearly shows that sponges are influenced by sediment in a variety of ways, most studies confer that sponges are able to tolerate, and in some cases thrive, in sedimented environments. Critical gaps exist in our understanding of the physiological responses of sponges to sediment, adaptive mechanisms, tolerance limits, and the particularly the effect of sediment on early life history stages. ]"

The steady sulfur isotopic ratios show an overall stability of the S–D oceanic geochemical system as a whole and do not indicate any synchronous changes in anoxic deep oceanic and sediment processes. Therefore this led us to a hypothesis that the crucial changes that contributed to the recorded carbon cycling turnover are related to rapidly evolving ocean–continent–biosphere feedback. Coastal zones of the latest Silurian epicontinental seas accumulated considerable quantities of organic carbon from early vascular vegetation, which explosively expanded to inhabit vast near-coastal shallows and deltas. Large primary production of these early terrestrial plants and rapidly enhanced sedimentary burial of organic carbon were also responsible for CO 2 drawdown, which have resulted in reversed-greenhouse effect and a global climatic cooling tendency. This feedback was blocked when the sea level gradually dropped and led to shrinking of the Silurian epicontinental seas and the growing climatic deterioration during the S–D transition limited primary production. Furthermore, continued processes of regressive abrasion and erosion limited the storage of organic carbon, as well as the efficiency of the carbonate factory. During the following Early Devonian greenhouse interval, marine regression and active latest Caledonian tectonism promoted progressive weathering of the sedimentary organic matter. The oxidation of C-rich deposits caused the subsequent growth of CO 2 levels in the Early Devonian, culminating in the warming of global climate. ]"

Strong coastal upwelling and the Congo River strongly influence primary production. Much of the present knowledge of the South East Atlantic has been derived from ship-borne measurements and in situ sensors, which cannot generally provide extensive spatial and temporal coverage. Similarly, previous satellite studies of the region have often focused on small spatial areas and limited time periods. This paper provides an improved understanding of seasonal and interannual variability in ocean dynamics along the South East Atlantic coast of Africa using time series of satellite and model derived data products. Eighteen years of satellite sea surface temperature data are complimented by 7 years of sea level data. Three years of chlorophyll a data illustrate the seasonal biological response, but the time series is not of sufficient length for investigating interannual variability in chlorophyll biomass. Modelled wind fields are used to describe atmospheric forcing of the surface ocean. This is the first synoptic-scale description of the South East Atlantic from a suite of large spatial coverage, long time series products. Previous studies of seasonal and interannual variability in the region are reviewed and used to interpret key oceanographic features and processes identified in the satellite data. Key findings of this study are: 1. Descriptions of seasonal and interannual variability from these data show climate forcing of the South East Atlantic coast of Africa from both the northern and southern boundaries. Bimodal seasonal signals of equatorial origin propagate poleward along the Angolan coast, while the trade winds and events in the Agulhas region dominate the Agulhas Bank and Southern Benguela. The Northern Benguela is a mixed regime, under the influence of forcing from both directions. 2. The Benguela Niño years of 1984 and 1995 are clearly observed in sea surface temperature and sea level anomalies and correspond to anomalously weak southerly winds at the equator. These conditions were also observed in 1999, suggesting this too may have been a Benguela Niño year. 3. Consideration of putative Niño-type events in the equatorial Atlantic from this and other studies suggests that the frequency of these events is much higher than previously estimated and may be similar to the frequency of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, years of anomalously strong southerly winds at the equator occur during Pacific ENSO years. ]"

The analysis is based on extensive tsunami damage data for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake collected by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transportation of the Japanese Government. Multivariate tsunami fragility curves are developed through multinomial logistic regression of un-binned data. This approach facilitates the flexible development of various nested models considering inundation depth alone or inundation depth and velocity altogether. Statistical diagnostic metrics, such as the Bayesian Information Criterion, the Akaike Information Criterion , and the residual deviance, are used to determine which model improves the predictability of tsunami damage. The significance and importance of including flow velocity in the vulnerability models are assessed quantitatively by examining the influence of different spatial resolutions in elevation model and different source models. Then, the effects of coastal topography have been investigated. Numerical results show that flow velocity generally improves the fragility models, particularly for severer structural damage states, and that it is important for sites along the coast where the inundation depth is not extremely high. Coarse digital elevation model and inaccurate source models have influence on the calculated values of flow velocity and thus they affect the accuracy of fragility modeling. Finally, two different fragility models are calibrated for plain-type and ria-type coasts by reflecting differences in hydrodynamic behavior and recorded damage on the structures. ]"

Analysis of the time-stratigraphic history of point-sourced delta systems, using strike and dip cross sections, is used to evaluate the completeness of the stratigraphic record to resolve how basins fill, how vertical stratigraphic successions record time, and which surfaces record the longest hiatuses. The paper includes analyses and comparison of Quaternary and Cretaceous river and delta systems. Supply-dominated systems fed by rivers that are free to avulse, like the Holocene highstand Mississippi Deltas in the Gulf of Mexico , show a strong autogenic record. In the Mississippi deltas, a quasi-continuous Holocene stratigraphic record can be reconstructed but this record is distributed among a series of laterally offset delta complexes and component delta lobes. Although 1D vertical sections may sample less than 25% of the total time, and in many cases less than a few percent, a hiatus in one section typically correlates to deposits elsewhere. Deltas fed by entrenched rivers, and especially the lowstand shelf edge systems in the Gulf of Mexico , as well as the Mahakam in Kalimantan Indonesia, form a series of laterally-offset lobes at the shelf edge that look superficially similar in their pattern and areal scale to the autogenic lobes of the Mississippi delta, but the time stratigraphic relationships are very different. Rather than a quasi-complete time-stratigraphic record, each shelf edge lobe is interpreted as an allogenic lowstand delta, deposited over tens of thousands, versus thousands of years, and are bounded by a prolonged non-depositional hiatus, time equivalent to highstand deposition confined to the inner shelf. Analysis of strike cross sections within an allogenic lobe of the Lagniappe lowstand delta reveals an autogenic signal, similar, but at a smaller scale than the Mississippi. In 1D, the progradational part of an upward coarsening deltaic parasequence records the time it takes the delta to prograde past a given point, which is estimated to be a few hundred years, representing only a few percent of the time associated with progradation and transgression of a parasequence . Nevertheless, this part of the succession records the highest rates of deposition (typically 10–50 m/ka). Much of the time associated with a parasequence is tied up at the top surfaces that record periods of bypass, as the lobe progrades farther seaward, as well as transgressive surfaces of erosion and deepening. The trangressive units deposit at much slower rates (1 m/ka) recorded by highly bioturbated condensed sections. Analysis of fluvial and deltaic floodplains and channel belts also show a highly incomplete record (as little as 5% of elapsed time), reflecting the observation that rivers only occupy a small part of any given floodplain at any given time, especially when rivers are entrenched and floodplains may be exposed to form paleosols . Entrenched river deposits, such as valley fills, may record only a few percent of the total time, indicating that most of the valley records bypass and erosion. Aggrading floodplains, which may be more common during highstands of sea level, may contain more complete records, including peats and coals, with up to 50% of time recorded by sediment. A tentative reconstruction of the development of the fluvial Canterbury Plain of South Island, New Zealand, is offered as an example of the highly discontinuous nature of alluvial sedimentation. ]"

Data from 1997–1999 allow the comparison of seasonal variations during the strong 1997–1998 El Niño with more normal seasonal distributions during 1998–1999. Maximum nutrient supplies and chlorophyll standing stocks were observed during the seasonal upwelling period (August/September 1998, July 1999). In comparison, both nutrients and chlorophyll standing stocks were severely depressed during the 1997 summer sampling, and nitrate availability appeared to limit primary production. Usually winter conditions result in intermediate nutrient levels with primary production being limited by light availability. During the 1997–1998 winter, the enhanced poleward flow of coastal water resulted in the movement of warm, high salinity water to the Oregon coast. This poleward moving southern water had a lower N:P ratio than typical coastal water. Thus, El Niño conditions had two direct effects on nutrient supply: (1) reduced upwelling resulted in severe nitrogen limitation during the normal upwelling season; and (2) enhanced poleward movement of warm, high salinity water resulted in anomalously low N:P ratios in the halocline. The latter effect contributed to nitrate limitation during the El Niño spring. ]"

TFZs provide significant substrate to facilitate estuarine hypoxia and acidification. Extent of impairment varies as a function of hydrologic connectivity. Changes in biogeochemical processes in TFZs due to sea level rise are also discussed. Conceptual models to design future research directions are described at length. , The river's role as the aquatic continuum, transporting and transforming terrestrial material in transit to sea, has long been appreciated. Along this aquatic continuum lies an enigmatic river stretch known as the tidal freshwater zone (TFZ). Because it oscillates along the daily tidal cycle , yet records no salinity , TFZs are often overlooked or sporadically studied. Additionally, research efforts into TFZs have been disproportionately focused on the intertidal zone rather than the subtidal zone. The limited studies to date do, however, highlight the subtidal TFZ's importance in both the removal and transformation of terrestrial material before exchange at sea, and, as both a primary production and respiration hotspot. The shifts between biogeochemical activity within the TFZ vary in a semi-predictable manner based on hydrologic state. Presented here is a conceptual model, defining the TFZ as inseparable from the traditionally studied estuary by reviewing the relevant literature. The TFZ acts as a “fluidized bed reactor” which depends on marine and aquatic material delivery and tidally prolonged retention times. Subsequently, TFZ biogeochemical byproducts affect the saline estuarine reach's chemistry, water quality, and ecology. Specifically, TFZ biogeochemistry contributes significantly to episodic acidification and deoxygenation in the saline reaches, due to a hydrologic switch. Therefore, conceptualizing the TFZ and estuary as a single entity oscillating jointly between river and ocean dominated forces, within the framework of the pulse-shunt concept, developed in low order stream networks, is most apt. TFZ ecological and hydrological restoration efforts, like those occurring in the traditional estuary, will be needed to mitigate hydrologic switch events in the future. ]"

The very strong 1997–1998 El Niño was analyzed with respect to the long-term historic record to assess the forcing mechanisms for sea level and SST. Beginning in the spring of 1997, we observed several long-period (&gt;30 days) (&gt;30 days) fluctuations in daily sea level with amplitudes of over 10 cm at San Francisco, California.

The sea level fluctuations are also correlated with sea level fluctuations observed further south at Los Angeles and Tumaco, Columbia, which showed a poleward phase propagation of the sea level signal. We suggest that the sea level fluctuations were, to a greater degree, forced by the passage of remotely generated and coastally trapped waves that were generated along the equator and propagated to the north along the west coast of North America. However, both local and remote AWSA can significantly modulate the sea level signals.

Combining new analytical methods, ecology and history to shed light on ancient human-whale interactions ]","[ Ancient human-whale relationships are difficult to study because, counterintuitively, whales have been virtually invisible in the archaeological record despite the immense quantities of valuable products they provide. In this review, we explain the reasons for this invisibility, and we also show how an interdisciplinary approach combining archaeological and ethnographic studies with new biomolecular and isotopic techniques is yielding new insights, allowing a broader perspective on what whale bones found in archaeological sites or collections can tell us. Until recently, the rare whale bones found in archaeological sites were often overlooked or misidentified. The recent development of biomolecular methods, including ancient DNA analyses and collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (ZooMS), has enabled reliable identification of whale species from even small bone fragments. In addition, stable isotope analyses can provide information about ancient whale diets, feeding habits, migrations, or even environmental changes. Combined with radiocarbon dating , these approaches provide valuable ecological and historical context for whale conservation. The results obtained from these new analytical methods can be contextualised by historical and ethnographic information to shed light on ancient uses of whales. Indeed, ethnographic records from maritime cultures around the world reveal that in addition to the bones, whales were valued for their blubber, meat, baleen, intestines, nerves or even veins. Previously undetectable in the archaeological record, recent advances in the analysis of lipid and protein residues, trapped in ceramics or charcoal, can reveal the processing of marine mammal blubber oil in stone pits, the transport of whale products in containers, or the use of blubber for lighting. The identification of the whale species, thanks to ZooMS or ancient DNA analyses, is also essential to consider whether the bone may have originated not simply from scavenging, but through an active capture of the whale, as only some species could be caught with pre-industrial methods. Nonetheless, historical and ethnographic records reveal that a wide diversity of pre-industrial whaling techniques existed throughout the world, beyond the traditional boat and harpoon hunting. The tools they employed, such as natural traps, stone or wooden dams, nets, spears, arrows, and ropes leave few or no artefacts, or artefacts not specific to whaling. Therefore, the absence of unequivocal evidence of whaling should not be confused with evidence that it did not exist. ]"

This region, which has been identified as a “hotspot” for climate change, is therefore expected to experience environmental impacts that are considerably greater than those in many other places around the world. These natural pressures interact with the increasing demographic and economic developments occurring heterogeneously in the coastal zone, making the Mediterranean even more sensitive. This review paper aims to provide a review of the state of current functioning and responses of Mediterranean marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems with respect to key natural and anthropogenic drivers and to consider the ecosystems’ responses to likely changes in physical, chemical and socio-economical forcings induced by global change and by growing anthropogenic pressure at the regional scale. The current knowledge on and expected changes due to single forcing (hydrodynamics, solar radiation, temperature and acidification, chemical contaminants) and combined forcing (nutrient sources and stoichiometry, extreme events) affecting the biogeochemical fluxes and ecosystem functioning are explored. Expected changes in biodiversity resulting from the combined action of the different forcings are proposed. Finally, modeling capabilities and necessity for modeling are presented. A synthesis of our current knowledge of expected changes is proposed, highlighting relevant questions for the future of the Mediterranean ecosystems that are current research priorities for the scientific community.

Such events can be orders of magnitude larger than their onshore equivalents. Despite the hazard they pose, many aspects of submarine landslides remain poorly understood, such as why they fail on low angle (&lt;2°), seemingly stable slopes. Many studies have proposed that failure on low slope angles, and the large areal extent of submarine landslides, may be controlled by the presence of laterally-extensive weak layers embedded within the slope stratigraphy, which precondition slopes to failure. Little remains known, however, about the characteristics and processes that control and form weak layers. We conducted a comprehensive review of published submarine landslide studies that examine failure planes and apparent weak layers associated with historical and ancient submarine landslides. Based on a new global landslide catalogue that comprises 64 case studies, this review aims to investigate the types of sediment that form weak layers and to understand the controls on their global variability. Existing classification schemes are based on mechanical process(es), and do not readily enable a diagnosis of weak layers from unfailed sediments. Here, a new and complementary classification of weak layers based on lithology is introduced. This classification enables weak layer recognition from sediment cores (including those sampling unfailed sediments), and allows us to attribute failure mechanisms to different environmental settings where distinct types of weak layers are more likely. The results show that failure planes usually form in the vicinity of an interface between distinct lithologies that together comprise a weak layer. The weak layers of 22 of the 64 case studies were related to characteristic sediment sequences within the slope stratigraphy, of which 19 were classified based on direct measurements from sediment cores and in-situ measurements: 16 weak layers were classified as siliciclastic, four as volcaniclastic, and two as fossiliferous sediment sequences. Only three submarine landsides were related to clay-dominated weak layers. In addition, failure along lithological contrasts was inferred for six case studies. Based on global depositional models likely locations of these different types of weak layer can be inferred. These include oceanic gateways where long-term circulation can create distinct permeability interfaces within siliciclastic sequences, areas of high productivity where biogenic sediments may dominate, and regions that experience widespread ash fall from volcanic eruptions. We highlight that many submarine landslide studies have historically not collected sediment cores that characterise weak layers within intact sedimentary sequences and instead have focused on characterising the slope failure deposit. As weak layers can collapse or become heavily modified during failure, there is a widespread omission of key information required for geotechnical analysis to determine where and why certain slopes are predisposed to failure. We conclude by highlighting the need to combine detailed geotechnical measurements with sedimentological and geophysical analyses including grain-scale observations (e.g. micro-Computed Tomography 3D imagery), and emphasise the importance of a uniform workflow that will allow for a better comparison between individual studies. ]"

A large proportion of the world's population lives near coastlines; thus, a high proportion of hazard from active tectonics comes from submarine fault systems and volcanic and landslide generators of tsunamis. During and shortly after large earthquakes, in the coastal and marine environment, a spectrum of evidence is left behind. Onshore, land levels change with elastic unflexing of the formerly coupled plates, thereby resulting in coastal subsidence, uplift, or lateral shift, and the generation of familiar onshore paleoseismic evidence, such as fault scarps , colluvial wedges, damaged trees, landslides, and offset features. If the seafloor is shaken or displaced, another suite of events may result in further geologic and geodetic evidence of the event, including turbidity currents , submarine landslides , tsunami, and soft-sediment deformation. Offshore and lacustrine records offer the potential of good preservation, good spatial coverage, and long temporal span. Marine deposits offer significant opportunities for stratigraphic correlation along the source zone. Stratigraphic correlation methods have a potential to address source zone spatial extent and segmentation, and because of the longer time intervals available, it can be used to examine recurrence models, fault interactions, clustering, and other phenomena commonly limited by short temporal records. ]"

For instance, intense tropical rainfall in mountain areas is responsible for some of the most catastrophic floods and landslides in Latin America, such as those that occur in northern Venezuela, Colombia, and southeastern Brazil. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation also triggers a variety of geomorphologic hazards along the continent such as the floods, landslides, and coastal erosion that affect desert areas of the Pacific coast and the floods and landslides that affect southeastern Brazil and the La Plata Basin. In Central America and Mexico, hurricane landfalls from the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean bring intense rainfall, winds, and storm surges that cause devastating floods and landslides. Many of the devastating effects of natural hazards and disasters have been aggravated by increased human-induced vulnerability in various Latin American regions. Human-induced desertification in Patagonia and accelerated fluvial erosion in south and southeastern Brazil are examples of negative human effects on the Latin American landscape that aggravate the effects of natural disasters. Climatic trends in South America during the last few decades, in particular in the Argentinean plains, have also contributed to flood aggravation. ]"

This high productivity is driven by a unique mix of factors, including: coastal upwelling, wind-driven mixing, extreme tidal mixing and turbulence, thermohaline circulation that moves intermediate waters into the mixed layer, coastal-trapped waves, regular sediment resuspension , and, to a lesser extent, agricultural runoff , released nutrients from erosion of ancient Colorado River Delta sediments, and perhaps input from decomposing tidal-flat plant debris. It has been suggested that decreased Colorado River flow, due to anthropogenic water impoundments and diversions, has had a negative impact on the health of the Northern Gulf of California ecosystem, particularly by reducing primary productivity and/or stock production of finfish and shellfish. However, there is no evidence that surface flow from the Colorado River is now, nor has ever been an important driver of primary productivity in the Northern Gulf, and nutrient/chlorophyll studies show no relationship to Colorado River flow (or, if anything, reduced nutrient/chlorophyll levels occur during high river-flow periods). And, there is very limited and equivocal evidence to support the claim that reduced river flow has significantly impacted secondary productivity in the Northern Gulf. The marine ecosystem of the Northern Gulf remains rich in nutrients, high in biodiversity and productivity, and appears to continue to be healthy, except for the impacts of historical and current fisheries. Human extraction of shrimp, Gulf corvina, totoaba (largely illegally), and other marine resources, remain very high in this region. There also is no evidence that reduced Colorado River flow has negatively impacted the health of the critically endangered vaquita porpoise, and assertions that it has done so deflect attention from the actual cause of decline—bycatch in legal and illegal gillnet fisheries. A review of Colorado River Delta research confirms that, historically and perhaps as long as the river has reached the Gulf of California, there have been long periods of no flow, or greatly reduced flow to the sea. Thus, the ecosystem is historically adapted to broadly fluctuating river flows and elevated salinities . Although commonly used by recent researchers, measurements of Colorado River water crossing the border into Mexico do not provide a reliable proxy for how much water (if any) actually reaches the Upper Gulf because of the complex nature of internal basins and diversions in the region. ]"

Heterogeneous reactions of chloride depletion of SSA are comprehensively reviewed. Potential factors affecting chloride depletion of SSA are discussed. , Sea spray aerosol (SSA) is the largest natural source of aerosols in the troposphere , and has profound potential significance for climate change, visibility, and human health. It has been shown that the aging process of SSA in the atmosphere by various chemical transformations can result in chloride depletion, releasing HCl, Cl 2 , ClNO 2 , etc. These active chlorine species can significantly affect the atmospheric oxidizing capacity in the troposphere and stratosphere . Compared with the fresh SSA, the aged SSA exhibits distinctly different behaviors in hygroscopicity , optical properties , and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)/ice nuclei (IN) activity. The literature over the past three decades has dramatically broadened the knowledge of the chloride depletion and improved our understanding of the interconnection between the ocean, atmosphere, and SSA. This paper provides a critical review and synthesis of field observations and laboratory studies on chloride depletion of SSA. More specifically, we summarize recent discoveries in the various types of heterogeneous reactions that lead to chloride depletion, the experimental methodology, mechanism and potential influencing factors. General conclusions are drawn that the acidic species, particle size, types and mixing state, and environmental factors have a significant impact on chloride depletion of SSA. Particularly, the difference in mixing state between individual SSA plays a crucial role in chloride depletion but is still ambiguous. Finally, we conclude with a summary on the results and inadequacy of current laboratory and field studies on chlorine depletion of SSA and some future research perspectives. ]"

Each of these six factors has influenced the geomorphology, sedimentation, stratigraphy, petrology and geometry of the Cenozoic sedimentary units and the diversity of surficial Quaternary coastal deposits.

Major geologic units can be neatly placed in the plate tectonic context, albeit critical mapping in specific areas is still needed, but the key processes involved in the building of the island remain under discussion. Of the two plates in the vicinity of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea Plate (PSP) is oceanic in its origin while the Eurasian Plate (EUP) is comprised partly of the Asian continental lithosphere and partly of the transitional lithosphere of the South China Sea basin. It is unanimously agreed that the collision of PSP and EU is the cause of the Taiwan orogeny , but several models of the underlying geological processes have been proposed, each with its own evolutionary history and implied subsurface tectonics. TAIGER (TAiwan Integrated GEodynamics Research) crustal- and mantle-imaging experiments recently made possible a new round of testing and elucidation. The new seismic tomography resolved structures under and offshore of Taiwan to a depth of about 200 km. In the upper mantle , the steeply east-dipping high velocity anomalies from southern to central Taiwan are clear, but only the extreme southern part is associated with seismicity ; toward the north the seismicity disappears. The crustal root under the Central Range is strongly asymmetrical; using 7.5 km/s as a guide, the steep west-dipping face on the east stands in sharp contrast to a gradual east-dipping face on the west. A smaller root exists under the Coastal Range or slightly to the east of it. Between these two roots lies a well delineated high velocity rise spanning the length from Hualien to Taitung. The 3-D variations in crustal and mantle structures parallel to the trend of the island are closely correlated with the plate tectonic framework of Taiwan. The crust is thickest in the central Taiwan collision zone , and although it thins toward the south, the crust is over 30 km thick over the subduction in the south; in northern Taiwan, the northward subducting PSP collides with Taiwan and the crust thins under northern Taiwan where the subducting indenter reaches 50 km in depth. The low Vp/Vs ratio of around 1.6 at a mid-crustal depth of 25 km in the Central Range indicates that current temperatures could exceed 700 °C. The remarkable thickening of the crust under the Central Range, its rapid uplift without significant seismicity, its deep exhumation and its thermal state contribute to make it the core of orogenic activities on Taiwan Island. The expanded network during the TAIGER deployment captured broadband seismic data yielding enhanced S-splitting results with mainly SKS/SKKS data. The polarization directions of the fast S-waves follow very closely the structural trends of the island, supporting the concept of a vertically coherent Taiwan orogeny in the outer few hundred kilometers of the Earth. ]"

This basin, located in the Southern California Bight adjacent to the coast, is roughly 100km long, 40km wide and 900m deep. From the sea surface to a depth of about 250m, the basin is open to the San Diego Trough to the southeast, the Santa Barbara Channel to the northwest, and the Santa Cruz basin to the west. The resulting data set is the first spatially comprehensive data set over the continental slope of the US west coast, the first comprehensive data set in a coastal region of such complicated topography, and the first that includes detailed measurements over a semi-enclosed shelf, namely, Santa Monica bay. The most significant contributions of the research based on this data set are: (1) demonstration of the alteration of a low mode coastal-trapped wave by a sharp bend in topography; (2) demonstration that fluctuating currents on a semi-enclosed shelf can be driven by the flow along its open boundary; (3) demonstration that topographic waves exist in the completely enclosed portion of coastal basins. In addition, the research allowed an order of magnitude improvements in regional knowledge of both the seasonal and subtidal scale fluctuations within the Southern California Bight. For example, on seasonal scales, the winter surfacing of the California undercurrent (the dominant feature of the seasonal mean flow field) as well as the continuity of the undercurrent in a spatially limited region were addressed. The existence of an equatorward undercurrent at mid water column depths (300–500m) over the continental slope during the late summer to fall season was also documented. On subtidal scales, the data demonstrated that the velocity field is far from “quiescent” over the basin, even below the depth of the deepest basin sill. Spatially-organized subtidal fluctuations occur at all depths and the time scale of the dominant fluctuations (∼ 20–30d) is a factor of two or more longer than that typical of most coastal shelves. The fluctuations have a subsarface maximum during most of the year and the maximum is best developed in late summer and over the mainland slope of the basin. Propagation characteristics south of the basin and within the basin along its coastal perimeter are consistent with those of first mode freely propagating coastal-trapped waves at these long periods. The long period waves enter the basin from southeast and then appear to pivot conterclockwise around the basin, so that at least some porion of the waves exits the basin over its western sill. The phase speed of the waves is reduced by an order of magnitude over all but the coastal slope of the basin. Below sill-depth velocity and temperature fluctuations appear to be the signature of freely propagating basin-scale topographic waves driven by the long period upper water column fluctuations. The waves travel counterclockwise around the lower basin at speeds about 25cm s −1 . Current fluctuations over the adjacent inner Santa Monica shelf have significant variance at shorter periods as well as at the longer periods observed over the basin and its slopes. These fluctuations are driven predominantly by boundary forcing over the outer shelf and only secondary by local wind stress. Wind data suggests that although local upwelling within the Bight is extremely limited from late spring through fall, strong upwelling events occur routinely in winter early spring. During the summer to fall months effects of upwelling may be experienced within the Bight, but these effects are primarily the results of upwelling outside the Bight in combination with lateral advection. During periods of strong upwelling outside the Bigth, outflow from Santa Monica basin appears to be preferentially directed south of the Channel Islands rather than through the Santa Barbara Channel. ]"

Earliest indications of palaeoclimate cooling occurs shortly after 33.9 Ma. , Australia's Gippsland Basin contains a semi-continuous Eocene-Oligocene (41.5–28.4 Ma) near-coastal coal record that formed adjacent to Pacific Ocean. Traralgon and Morwell Formation brown coals include 4 main seams (T2, T1, T0, M2). Coal seam palynology records show late Middle Eocene (T2) coals formed under megathermic conditions characterized by high-gymnosperm contents, Late Eocene (T1) coals formed under mesothermic conditions characterized by reduced-gymnosperm contents and earliest indications of palaeoclimate cooling. Earliest Oligocene T0 coal record (33.9–31.5 Ma) contains high-gymnosperm palynology profile, very similar to the T2 coals. The earliest indication of cooler climes only begins after this coal formed as indicated by low-gymnosperm high-Nothofagus (southern beech) pollen proportions. We suggest in Gippsland the earliest evidence for major glacial cooling (by inference the Oi1 event) be placed immediately above the T0 coal seam where Early to Late Oligocene Morwell Formation sands, clays and coals contain low counts of gymnosperms (&lt; 10%) but high average proportions of Nothofagus (50%). This is the main definitive indicator that palaeoclimates had cooled between the Eocene and Oligocene. This agrees with the current ocean drilling position of the earliest (Oi1) glacial event shortly above the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. A number of contemporaneous Middle to Late Eocene brown coals occurred in near-coastal settings across 1200 km of southern Australia. Palaeogeographically, all these coal basins faced the Australo-Antarctic Gulf and have a much lower gymnosperm proportion (&lt; 10%), low Nothofagus proportion (&lt; 10%), but very high (non- Nothofagus ) angiosperms proportion. This suggests a different climatic regime separated a cooler and wetter Gippsland Basin flora that responded to the cooler Proto-Ross Sea Gyre rotating around a wide Pacific Ocean, and a warm-wet climate associated with a warm proto-Leeuwin current of the Australo-Antarctic Gulf. ]"

That discussion was basically triggered by the need to meet the demand for research generated by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (1972). More recently, also as a consequence of the inputs from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, 1992), the discussion of the role of oceanography in the framework of the co-operation between physical and social disciplines was initiated focusing on the prospect of building up the ocean science . The prospect of the ocean science as designed by IOC (1984) was finalised only to integrate the branches of oceanography. To discuss how that design could be implemented on the basis of progress in epistemology and ocean policy, the subject is focused on considering three levels: i) the epistemological level , where the option between positivism- and constructivism- based epistemologies has arisen; ii) the logical level , where the option is concerned with disjunctive and conjunctive logic; and iii) the methodological level , where the option regards the analytical-deductive and the inductive-axiomatic methods. The thesis is sustained that, to meet the demand for management-oriented research, the pathway including constructivist epistemology, conjunctive logic and inductive-axiomatic methods could be usefully adopted as the cement of inter-disciplinarity. The second part of the paper is concerned with the Mediterranean, and how holism-referred and management-aimed investigations might be conducted by applying the above conceptual approach is considered: i) presenting the individual emerging subject areas on which the demand for management patterns is expected to focus in the mid- and long-run; ii) illustrating the major aspects of the individual subject areas to be investigated; iii) deducing what leading role might be assigned to oceanography in building up inter-disciplinary approaches; iv) which disciplines might be stimulated to co-operate.

Previous investigators, solely based on the U-Pb zircon geochronology for the detrital grains, all advocated the important roles, but with varying emphasis, of drainage systems in the South China Block. Influence of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River from the far-source Yangtze block versus nearby systems like Zhujiang, Minjiang and Jiulongjiang Rivers in the Cathaysia block has been the main issue. However, the fundamental question of whether the provenance is really the South China Block has never been evaluated. Here we report both the U-Pb zircon and Electron MicroProbe (EMP) monazite age data for seven sediment samples from two sides of the Taiwan Strait and synthesize the published data for all these rivers and sedimentary strata in western Taiwan to tackle this problem. The lack of, or insufficient, ~1.8 Ga monazites in the sediments of river mouths for all drainage systems in the South China Block makes them unlikely to be the source of Miocene sediments in western Taiwan where ~1.8 Ga monazite grains occupy 14.5–33.3% of the total age population. With reference to the tectonic evolution of the coastal southeast China-Taiwan region during Early Cretaceous to recent time, we propose a new explanation that invokes a now-concealed microcontinent along the Manila Trench. This microcontinent, probably related to a Paleoproterozoic orogen in Gondwana , eventually collided with the South China Block causing uplift of the easternmost structural element—the Pingtan-Dongshan Metamorphic Belt (PDMB) at ca. 130–120 Ma. It then drifted away sometime after 100 Ma and split into two parts with one becoming today's Palawan-Mindoro terrain of the Philippines. As indicated by the geophysical data near southern Taiwan, the remainder of this split microcontinent had subducted underneath the Philippine Sea plate along Manila Trench as a result of the opening of the South China Sea at ~33 Ma. Both the Peikang and Kuanyin basement highs in the offshore western Taiwan represent the unsubducted remnants of this microcontinent and also the major suppliers of Late Oligocene-Miocene sediments in western Taiwan. On the other hand, the Eocene-Early Oligocene strata of the Hsuehshan Range in central Taiwan show both zircon and monazite age patterns resembling the Eocene-Early Oligocene and recent sediments of the Zhujiang drainage system, indicating the southwestern origin of the protolith Taiwan. This scenario also matches the recent proposition that part of the Central Range belongs to the deep-level accretionary prism of a Miocene subduction system. ]"

The palaeogeographic and physiographic evolution of the basin is illustrated. The present results allow to better understand the late Quaternary glacio-eustatic changes. , During the last 0.45 Ma, the Crotone Basin, a forearc basin located on the Ionian side of Calabria, southern Italy, experienced a phase of uplift that persists today. The transition from subsidence to uplift occurred close to the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 (ca. 0.4 Ma). The subsequent progressive emergence of the area was punctuated by several marine transgressions linked to high-frequency, high-magnitude glacio-eustatic changes, which are recorded as coastal terraces. These high-frequency sequences show a variable stacking pattern due to the interplay between glacio-eustasy, uplift and local physiography. In particular, a progressive SE-ward migration of the shoreline is documented in the study area since MIS 11. This trend was enhanced during the MIS 5.5 to MIS 2 time interval, due to the combined effect of uplift and lowering glacio-eustatic sea level until the Last Glacial Maximum . Moreover, the regional uplift also led to a physiographic change from relatively low-gradient to high-gradient settings between MIS 7.1 and MIS 5.5. A comparison between the late Quaternary geological record of the Crotone Basin and that of other basins is crucial to improve the present knowledge on past sea levels related to MISs. This ultimately will help to better understand the Holocene sea-level history and the human contribution to sea-level change, in order to predict future scenarios. ]"

However, adaptation planning uptake is slow. This is particularly unfortunate because patterns of urban form interact with mean sea level rise (MSLR) in ways that reduce or intensify its impact. There are currently two main barriers that are significant in arresting the implementation of adaptation planning with reference to the MSLR projections composed of geomorphologic MSLR projections and eustatic MSLR projections from global climate warming, and making a comprehensive risk assessment of MSLR projections. The present review shows recent progresses in mapping MSLR projections and their risk assessment approaches on Chinese delta cities, and then a perspective of adapting these cities to MSLR projections as following six aspects. 1) The geomorphologic MSLR projections are contributed by the natural tectonic subsidence projections and the MSLR projections by anthropogenic geomorphologic change. The former needs to be updated in a global framework. The latter is accumulated by land subsidence from underground water depletion, water level fall caused by the erosion of riverbeds from a sediment supply decline attributed to the construction of watershed dams, artificial sand excavation, water level raise by engineering projects including land reclamation , deep waterway regulation, and fresh water reservoirs. 2) Controlling MSLR projections by anthropogenic geomorphologic changes. 3) The IPCC AR5 RCPs MSLRs scenarios are expected to be projected to the local eustatic MSLR projections on the Chinese deltas. 4) The MSLR projections need to be matched to a local elevation datum . 5) Modeling approaches of regional river-sea numerical with semi-analytical hydrodynamics, estuarine channel network, system dynamics and adaptation points are perspective. 6) Adaptation planning to MSLR projections requires a comprehensive risk assessment of the risk of flood, fresh water supply shortage, coastal erosion , wetland loss, siltation of ports and waterway in Chinese delta cities and adjacent regions. ]"

Detailed advices on corresponding technical and administrative methods were given. , The study reported and analyzed the current state of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in urban China from the aspects of scale, treatment processes, sludge handling, geographical distribution, and discharge standards. By 2012, there were 3340 WWTPs in operation in China with a capacity of 1.42 × 10 8 m 3 /d. The number of medium-scale WWTPs (1–10 × 10 4 m 3 /d) counted for 75% of total WWTPs. On average, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies of small-scale, medium-scale, large-scale and super-large-scale WWTPs were 81, 85.5, 87.5 and 86.5%, respectively. Generally speaking, the nutrients removal instead of COD removal was of concern. As to the different processes, oxidation ditch, anaerobic–anoxic–oxic (A 2 /O) and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) were the mainstream technologies in China. These technologies had minor difference in terms of overall COD removal efficiency. The sludge treatment in WWTPs was basically “thickening-coagulation-mechanical dehydration” and the major disposal method was sanitary landfill in China. The distributions of WWTPs and their utilization showed significant regional characteristics. The sewage treatment capacity of China concentrated on the coastal areas and middle reaches of Yangtze River, which were the economically developed zones. Besides, most WWTPs enforced the Class 1 or Class 2 discharge standards, but few realized wastewater reuse. Finally, existing problems were discussed, including low removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus, emerging contaminants , low reuse of reclaimed water, poor sludge treatment and disposal, low execution standard of effluent, and emissions of greenhouse gas from WWTPs. Suggestions regarding potential technical and administrative measures were given. ]"

Comparison between events is facilitated by long-term records for Yakutat, Tofino, Neah Bay, and San Francisco which appear to be representative of distinct coastal oceanic regimes. Residual (tide-removed) time series reveal that the anomalously high sea levels of the 1997–98 El Niño persisted from the spring of 1997 to the spring of 1998, and this event was more protracted than the 1982–83 El Niño. During both major events, the annual (Sa), semiannual (Ssa), and synoptic-scale sea level constituents were amplified relative to non-El Niño years, with synoptic fluctuations in sea level height and sea level pressure for mid-latitude sites Tofino and Neah Bay strongly correlated through the inverted barometer response. The spectral anomaly coefficient, S j R ( ω )=[ R j ( ω )−1]/[ R j ( ω )+1] (where R j (ω)=S j / S ̄ j R j (ω)=S j / S ̄ j is the spectral ratio between the El Niño spectrum, S j ( ω ), and the time-averaged non-El Niño spectrum, S(ω) j S(ω) j , for tide gauge site “ j ”) indicates that both events gave rise to enhanced sea level variability at periods of days to weeks because of passing atmospheric systems. However, the 1982–83 El Niño generated greater signal variance at seasonal-scales (periods of months) while the 1997–98 El Niño generated greater variance at synoptic scales (periods of days). Findings further indicate that poleward oceanic propagation of the 1982–83 and 1997–98 events terminated near central California, and that much of the enhanced sea level variability observed at mid to high latitudes was associated with atmospheric teleconnection responses that gave rise to amplified variations in coastal sea level pressure and/or surface wind stress. ]"

Now interpreted as phoronid worm tubes of microconchid origin, the true paleoenvironment (i.e. paleosalinity) for these tubeworms can be determined with a detailed study of their distribution with respect to local sedimentology as well as with recognition of their biologic characteristics to determine their ability to osmoregulate. Osmoregulation is a key characteristic in determining the ability of a marine body type to tolerate freshwater. The literature on over three hundred localities worldwide covering Phanerozoic lacustrine sites and Paleozoic to Lower Triassic marine-influenced sites were searched and those containing microconchid fossils ranging from “freshwater to marine” were documented; data collection included presence or absence of these worm tubes, their preservation mode as transported or in life position, and their associated fauna and flora along with paleoenvironmental interpretation. These worm tubes are not documented from any purely freshwater continental paleoenvironment unconnected to the ocean. All fossil occurrences of these microconchid tubes are in association with coastlines, whether within a nonmarine-marine transition (tidal coast, estuary, delta) or a distal transition floodplain within a low-gradient coastal area potentially affected by rare storm surges or tsunamis. The biology of this organism supports a marine affinity because of its and its sister phylum Brachiopoda need for osmoregulation within marine salinities only. Opportunistic settling on hard substrates or plants and the growth of a shell occurring within an hour during larval settlement are similar to modern spirorbid polychaete worms. The ‘ Spirorbis ’ problem of multiple life habitats is solved: microconchid worm larvae can settle anywhere where currents exist along a coastline and as far inland as storm surges can go, but they only thrive within true marine conditions and are not freshwater fauna. Microconchid worm tubes preserved within continental settings indicate marine influence only, not living habitats. ]"

A review and definition of shore platform morphology ],"[ Shore platforms are erosional coastal landforms that have attracted scientific attention since the mid 19th century. The defining element of a platform is width that is used in many calculations such as determining a platform's evolutionary state or inferring how wave energy is distributed along the shore. Although a critical variable, there are no uniform criteria for defining the seaward edge. Quantification of platform width has been driven by site-specific variables, with the seaward edge defined on the basis of tides, morphology, biology, processes and sediment coverage. The lack of a uniform definition has meant that comparative studies are difficult and results are possibly spurious, as widths derived from very different criteria can vary by an order of magnitude just on the basis of which criteria is used to determine its edge. In this review a combination of morphologic and process elements is used to define the seaward edge of a shore platform. The development of strict criteria is especially needed in an environment of rising sea levels if measurements of landscape change are to be made. In addition, the advent of seamless datasets that cross the land–sea boundary means that the delineation of platform morphology is no longer limited by physical access. This review concludes that the seaward edge of a shore platform will occur at or landward of wave base and should be defined as: the point where active erosion of the bedrock ceases, characterised by erosional features such as notches and block-plucking scars or the deposition of sediment of such a thickness that the underlying bedrock is not exposed during storm events. ]"

Ecosystem based marine spatial management (EB-MSM) is an approach that recognizes the full array of interactions within an ecosystem, including human uses, rather than considering single issues, species, or ecosystem services in isolation. Marine spatial planning and ocean zoning are emerging concepts that can support EB-MSM. EB-MSM is driven by high-level goals that managers aim to achieve through the implementation of measures. High-level goals and objectives need to be translated into more operational objectives before specific targets, limits and measures can be elaborated. Monitoring, evaluation and adaptation are necessary to ensure that marine management measures are both effective and efficient. Solid monitoring frameworks are the foundation of adaptive management, as they provide the necessary information to evaluate performance and the effectiveness of management actions. Marine protected areas (MPAs) - possibly set up in networks - constitute a key component in EB-MSM policies and practises and have been applied as a cornerstone in conservation of marine biodiversity, management of fish populations, development of coastal tourism, etc. Moreover, MPA experiences have provided methods and concepts (such as zoning) to a wider EB-MSM context. The assignment of values to biophysical features of the marine environment allows the direct assessment of related management choices and may assist EB-MSM. A range of monetary valuation techniques have been proposed to reduce attributes of goods and services to a single metric. However, in the marine environment such an approach is often over simplistic, and thus less reductive techniques may be necessary. Rather than producing a single metric, the results of non-monetary assessments guide policy allowing weight to be given as necessary to potential areas of conflict and consensus. Strategies to take into account climate change effects and geohazard risks in EB-MSM have been applied or proposed worldwide. EB-MSM regimes must be alert to such risks and flexible to account for changes. ]"

The topics cover improvements in tsunami numerical modeling including multi-physics simulations, applications to source modeling, hazard assessment and real-time forecasting and warning. During the last 10 years, tsunami numerical modeling has been improved, validated and applied to better predict tsunami’s behavior and impacts, with aids from the groundbreaking data of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake tsunami. Marked progresses have been made for propagation and inundation modeling, multi-physics simulations such as sediment transport modeling and real-time forecasting and warning. Sediment transport modeling since the Tohoku earthquake tsunami has shown that it may profit from bridging different disciplines to gain further advance in disaster science. Despite the progresses, further exploration for better accuracy and capability, and improved understanding of model limitations and uncertainties is needed. Source modeling of the Tohoku earthquake tsunami, with aids from tsunami records and other geophysical datasets, have provided detailed depiction of the spatial distribution of initial water level, fault slip and mechanism and process of tsunami amplification. To improve assessment of tsunami hazards and related damages, the source features of the Tohoku earthquake tsunami were characterized and applied to hazard assessments of future tsunamis in other areas. The characterization will benefit from not overlooking ‘unexpected’ hazards and damages, although some other processes, such as rupture propagation and submarine mass failure, cannot be excluded from uncertainty quantification in tsunami source modeling. As in past years, tsunami numerical modeling will play a crucial role in policy making and consensus building for tsunami disaster mitigation actions, with efforts for better transmission of the model’s intent, limitation and uncertainty. ]"

For teletsunamis, as scientific information (forecast model wave heights, first-wave arrival times, etc.) from NOAA's West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center is made available, federal- and state-level emergency managers must help convey this information in a concise, comprehensible and timely manner to local officials who ultimately determine the appropriate response activities for their jurisdictions. During the September 29, 2009 Tsunami Advisory for California, government geoscientists assisted the California Emergency Management Agency by providing technical assistance during teleconference meetings with NOAA and other state and local emergency managers prior to the arrival of the tsunami. This technical assistance included background information on anticipated tidal conditions when the tsunami was set to arrive, wave height estimates from state-modeled scenarios for areas not covered by NOAA's forecast models, and clarifying which regions of the state were at greatest risk. Over the last year, state geoscientists have started to provide additional assistance: 1) working closely with NOAA to simplify their tsunami alert messaging and expand their forecast modeling coverage; 2) creating “playbooks” containing information from existing tsunami scenarios for local emergency managers to reference during an event; and, 3) developing a state-level information “clearinghouse” and pre-tsunami field response team to assist local officials as well as observe and report tsunami effects.

Continental sequence stratigraphy provides a basis for correlation of frequent lateral and vertical facies changes, a framework for interpretation of continental deposits, and predictive models for facies geometry and reservoir architecture. The subaerial unconformity , the maximum flooding surface, and the correlative conformity are the three basic surfaces suitable for bounding units in continental sequence stratigraphy. Other sequence stratigraphic terminology commonly used in marine sequence stratigraphic work such as systems tracts and parasequences can be applied to continental sequences, but it may be more applicable to certain depositional environments that mimic some marine processes, such as lacustrine settings. Continental carbonates are extremely useful in sequence stratigraphic studies as shown by numerous case studies reviewed in this chapter. The most commonly used carbonates for sequence boundary delineation are mature calcic paleosols/calcic paleosol pedocomplexes and palustrine deposits. In some settings, palustrine carbonates are so overprinted by pedogenesis that both types of carbonates essentially mark the same sequence boundary. Nevertheless, both calcic paleosols/pedocomplexes and palustrine calcretes are typically associated with regional surfaces and possess physical properties that make them easily identifiable on the surface and in the subsurface. Controls on the formation of continental carbonates within a sequence stratigraphic framework are varied and often are interrelated. Although carbonate-bearing sequences and carbonates that delineate sequence boundaries are mainly controlled by tectonism and climate, eustasy may play a major role in coastal plain settings. Many case studies are presented in this chapter that document the role of tectonism, climate, and eustasy in the sequence stratigraphy of continental carbonates. ]"

This information can be used to make management decisions and reveal fundamental aspects of an organism’s biology. Distinct intrinsic (e.g., biological characteristics) and extrinsic (e.g., geographical and historical events, environment, human pressures) factors can influence population structure, with significant differences among species. However, detection of population structure in migratory lamprey species can be difficult to detect due to their lack of natal homing; this is particularly the case for anadromous lampreys, with their potential for wide dispersal at sea during their parasitic feeding stage. We review phenotypic and genetic markers, as well as the methods that have been used to assess population structure in lampreys, and discuss the relative strengths and limitations of each. Structure has been detected in several anadromous species using some of these methods, even without homing in these species, but we briefly contrast the weak population structure observed in anadromous species with the stronger structure observed in freshwater-resident lamprey species (particularly non-migratory brook lampreys). We relate lamprey population structure to species-specific ecological traits, such as juvenile dispersal tendencies, and provide case studies of six species. Delineation of appropriate management units in migratory lamprey species is important for conservation and management. ]"

By integrating a range of stratigraphic, sedimentologic, and geochronological datasets, the roles of various geological processes within the CFB are better constrained, especially more enigmatic subcrustal processes probably related to large-scale mantle flows. This study summarizes the complex shoreline evolution of the central part of the CFB (Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico) in 25 temporally constrained paleogeographic maps illustrating high-resolution shoreline history (location and migration trend) and distribution of gross depositional environments through the Late Cretaceous . Detailed stratigraphic synthesis indicates that sediment fill of the CFB was subject to complex interactions of tectonics (both local and regional scale and both crustal and subcrustal processes), eustasy , and sediment supply because stratigraphic stacking patterns and shoreline migration trends varied along the coeval shoreline during most of the Late Cretaceous . The spatial variability in the shoreline migration trend, as well as changes in the sediment dispersal pattern help to disentangle the effects of subsidence caused by crustal and/or subcrustal processes, and provide constraints on the spatial and temporal scales these processes operate on. Subcrustal processes such as mantle flow, possibly associated with enhanced coupling by subduction of an oceanic plateau (i.e., the conjugate Shatsky rise) attached to the Farallon plate, were documented as an important mechanism influencing the subsidence/uplift and sediment dispersal patterns in the CFB since at least ~85 Ma. The along-strike variation in shoreline migration trend along the coeval shoreline is likely the norm, rather than the exception, due to the spatial variation in topographic load, lithospheric strength, mantle-induced dynamic topography, and sediment supply across the CFB. Although quantifying the relative roles of different allogenic factors on the architecture of the CFB strata remains a challenging task, the chronostratigraphic framework, shoreline trends, and paleogeographic maps compiled herein could provide critical boundary conditions for forward modeling, such as geodynamic and landscape models, to better understand the paleogeographic and tectonic evolution of the CFB and other basins worldwide, in a more comprehensive way that considers the effect of the mantle on basin-formation. Eventually, high-resolution reconstruction of the geohistory of the CFB through holistic approaches will greatly advance our understanding of the roles of different allogenic factors in sediment filling of the CFB and enable us to better use the stratigraphic record of foreland basins as important archives of paleoenvironmental evolutions and the interaction between surficial and deep Earth processes through geological time . ]"

We provide data from both basins draining east of the continental divide ( n = 37) and discharging into the Tasman and Coral Seas, and from basins draining to the west as part of the larger Murray-Darling and Lake Eyre river systems ( n = 11). 10 Be-derived denudation rates in mainstem samples from east-draining basins range between 7.7 ± 1.9 (± 1σ; Mary) and 54.6 ± 13.7 mm kyr −1 (North Johnstone). Denudation rates in tributary samples range between 3.0 ± 0.7 (Burdekin) and 70.2 ± 18.9 mm kyr −1 (Liverpool). For west-draining basins, denudation rates are overall lower and with a more restricted range of 4.8 ± 1.2 (Barcoo) to 15.4 ± 3.6 mm kyr −1 (Maranoa) in mainstem samples, and between 4.4 ± 1.0 (Murrumbidgee) and 38.5 ± 7.8 mm kyr −1 (Murray) in tributary samples. East Australian denudation rates (median = 14.5 mm kyr −1 ) are similar to those found in other postorogenic landscapes (global median = 12.4 mm kyr −1 ) and the medians of the top 10% denudation rates recorded here (46.5 mm kyr −1 ) and in other passive margin settings are also similar, despite differences in topography and precipitation. These median denudation rate values are close to the 95th percentile denudation rate for all tectonically passive basins (≈53 mm kyr −1 ) and are very similar to the global silicate weathering speed limit (≈58 mm kyr −1 ) calculated as the 95th percentile of global soil weathering rates . The above suggests that in post-orogenic terrain, the overall rates of topographic decay have a ‘speed limit’ that is imposed by the rate at which rock is converted to soil by chemical weathering. Denudation rates along the East Australian margin correlate with topographic metrics at both the mainstem basin scale and at the smaller tributary basin scale suggesting that topography exerts the main control on rates of landscape lowering in this setting. An important link between denudation rate and rainfall is also inferred: the highest mainstem 10 Be denudation rates all occur in basins which also have the highest rainfall amounts and there is a strong correlation between the distance knickpoints have travelled upstream from the river mouth and basin area — a proxy for discharge and so to some extent also rainfall. On both sides of the divide, in all but a few of the samples, 26 Al/ 10 Be ratios are consistently lower than what is expected in a setting where sediments experience a simple and continuous exposure history. East of the continental divide, the lowest 26 Al/ 10 Be ratios are found in basins that also experience increased flood variability. We posit that there is a causal link between the hydrological variability that characterises the coastal rivers of eastern Australia and the observed non-steady state 26 Al/ 10 Be ratios: the periodic stripping of vertically accreted floodplains by large floods means that deeper and potentially older material is periodically incorporated into the sediment mix transported by the modern river. ]"

Settled particles and sediment cores were also sampled within OAR and FAR to determine aluminium, calcium, silicon and chlorophyll a and organic and inorganic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous. Results obtained showed that: (i) water column nutrients evidenced seasonal and spatial variability. The maximum nutrients concentration was recorded inside the lagoon and in OAR, mainly during warmer periods. Ammonium, nitrate and silicate in OAR were statistically higher ( p &lt;0.01, n =18) than in FAR and NRA; (ii) particulate organic carbon and nitrogen in FAR settled particles were significantly higher ( p &lt;0.005) than those collected at OAR; and (iii) organic carbon and nitrogen, calcium, aluminium and chlorophyll a in OAR upper sediment were higher than at FAR. The overall results suggest that OAR is a productive system, emphasizing its contribution to the trophic chain pull out, while FAR presented oceanic oligotrophic water. ]"

It differs from previously published reviews by focusing on three topics critical to the development of the Great Lakes: the glaciation of the Great Lakes watershed during the late Cenozoic, the evolution of the Great Lakes since the last glacial maximum, and the record of lake levels and coastal erosion in modern times. The Great Lakes are a product of glacial scour and were partially or totally covered by glacier ice at least six times since 0.78 Ma. During retreat of the last ice sheet large proglacial lakes developed in the Great Lakes watershed. Their levels and areas varied considerably as the oscillating ice margin opened and closed outlets at differing elevations and locations; they were also significantly affected by channel downcutting, crustal rebound, and catastrophic inflows from other large glacial lakes. Today, lake level changes of about a 1/3 m annually, and up to 2 m over 10 to 20 year time periods, are mainly climatically-driven. Various engineering works provide small control on lake levels for some but not all the Great Lakes. Although not as pronounced as former changes, these subtle variations in lake level have had a significant effect on shoreline erosion, which is often a major concern of coastal residents. ]"

Despite the genetic diversity and the spatial variability of As concentrations, the most common geogenic As-enriched groundwater occurs in flat, low-lying river floodplains and fluvial-lacustrine plains. Within river systems draining the Himalaya, tectonic movement, sedimentological processes and palaeoclimatic optima after the Last Glacial Maximum have created favorable conditions for the formation of high-As aquifer systems mainly within the Late Pleistocene-Holocene deposits. The co-deposition of As-bearing Fe oxides and reactive organic matter within sediments of deltas/floodplains or fluvial-lacustrine plains forms the premise for As release under reducing geochemical environments. However, depending on the reactivity of organic matter and As-bearing Fe oxides, as well as the availability of aqueous sulfate , geochemical mechanisms controlling As enrichment in the groundwater differ between the coastal floodplains of South and Southeast Asia and the fluvial-lacustrine plains of North and Central China. The indigenous geomicrobes thriving to adapt to specific aquifer environments may mediate Fe-S-As biogeochemical cycling responsible for As speciation transformation, dissolution/desorption, and hence mobilization. Hydrologic processes regulated by the local and regional groundwater flow regimes control As transport as well as its spatial distribution. Special attention must be paid to anthropogenic perturbation from intensive groundwater pumping and land use changes that affect the aquifer hydrological conditions and the biogeochemical processes, thus altering groundwater As levels. To decipher the patterns of As variation within the aquifers, an integrated approach characterizing the major sedimentological, hydrobiogeochemical and anthropogenic processes influencing As release and transport needs to be applied to ensure sustainable water supply for domestic and agricultural needs. ]"

Surface currents were collected with the purpose of studying the temporal and spatial modes of surface circulation in the area. Their dependence on local wind forcing was investigated using wind records from coastal stations and the mesoscale meteorological model ALADIN/HR. EOF decomposition, spectral and tidal analyses, and time-lagged correlation extracted the dominant features in the area and their time scales. The time-averaged flow presented a cyclonic circulation pattern with relatively weak currents and standard deviations comparable to average values. Three dominant current patterns were extracted by the EOF analysis, which accounted for about 70% of total variance. In the region, wind was the major source of current variability over a wide portion of frequencies, whereas tidal forcing was weak and limited to the semidiurnal and diurnal frequencies, representing 10%–20% of the total variance. The response to wind forcing was immediate with veering angles consistent with Ekman dynamics in the majority of the area. Coherence analyses revealed strong correlation within the sub-tidal and diurnal bands, the latter related to diurnal sea-breezes variability. The seasonal variability of the inertial motions was also observed in the area. ]"

Previous work has tackled this problem by applying a limited number of techniques (mostly sediment textures and heavy minerals) to parts of the large dryland. The generally highly quartzose mineralogy of aeolian dunes and their compositional variability have been only broadly evaluated and several sedimentological issues have thus remained controversial, including the relative role played by fluvial processes versus aeolian reworking of older sediments and weathering controls. This reveals a need for a systematic provenance study that considers the entire basin. For this reason, here we combine original petrographic, heavy-mineral, and detrital-zircon geochronology data with previously published clay-mineral, geochemical, and geochronological information to present the first comprehensive provenance study of the vast Kalahari sand sea. Our multi-proxy dataset comprises 100 samples, collected across the Kalahari Basin from 11°S (NW Zambia) to 28°S (NW South Africa) and from 15°E (Angola) to 28°30′W (Zimbabwe). Kalahari aeolian-dune sand mostly consists of monocrystalline quartz associated with durable heavy minerals and thus drastically differs from coastal dunefields of Namibia and Angola, which are notably richer in feldspar , lithic grains, and chemically labile clinopyroxene . The western Kalahari dunefield of southeastern Namibia is distinguished by its quartz-rich feldspatho-quartzose sand, indicating partly first-cycle provenance from the Damara Belt and Mesoproterozoic terranes . Within the basin, supply from Proterozoic outcrops is documented locally. Composition varies notably at the western and eastern edges of the sand sea, reflecting partly first-cycle fluvial supply from crystalline basements of Cambrian to Archean age in central Namibia and western Zimbabwe. Basaltic detritus from Jurassic Karoo lavas is dominant in aeolian dunes near Victoria Falls. Bulk-sediment petrography and geochemistry of northern and central Kalahari pure quartzose sand, together with heavy-mineral and clay-mineral assemblages, indicate extensive recycling via aeolian and ephemeral-fluvial processes in arid climate of sediment strongly weathered during previous humid climatic stages in subequatorial Africa. Distilled homogenized composition of aeolian-dune sand thus reverberates the echo of paleo-weathering passed on to the present landscape through multiple episodes of fluvial and aeolian recycling. Intracratonic sag basins such as the Kalahari contain vast amounts of quartz-rich polycyclic sand that may be tapped by rivers eroding backwards during rejuvenation stages associated with rift propagation. Such an event may considerably increase the sediment flux to the ocean, fostering the progradation of river-fed continental-embankments, as documented by augmented accumulation rates coupled with upward increasing mineralogical durability in the post-Tortonian subsurface succession of the Zambezi Delta. The Central Kalahari is not a true desert. It has none of the naked, shifting sand dunes that typify the Sahara and other great deserts of the world. In some years the rains may exceed twenty — once even forty — inches, awakening a magic green paradise.” Mark Owens, Cry of the Kalahari. ]"

It was generally found that the finer the taxonomic analysis of the plankton, the better it could be related to the horizontal distribution patterns of the North Sea current regime. During both the winter cruise and the late spring cruise, the largest planktonic biomasses were found in the central and northern North Sea. However, in late spring the influence of the shelf edge was evident from the incoming Calanus stocks, whereas in late winter the greatest biomasses stemmed from the Dogger Bank and the Skagerrak regions. At this time, the Dogger Bank was already a reproductive centre for various meroplanktic and holoplanktic organisms, which apparently provided the trophic basis for large populations of predators such as Sagitta spp., amphipods and Aglantha digitale . The large biomass in the Skagerrak was mainly based on various Atlantophilic forms such as Calanus finmarchicus, Metridia spp. and diverse mesopelagic copepods as well as euphausiids and chaetognaths. ]"

Tainting of seafood caused by industrial chemicals has been observed after groundings of seagoing tankers. For cases other than those of long-term or accidentally large volume discharges, “natural” reasons could be established for flavor impairments. There have been no reports of discharges from tank washings in the open ocean spoiling the flavor of seafood.

The types of palaeosols developed are influenced by four key palaeoenvironmental controls (atmosphere, biosphere , lithosphere and hydrosphere) on time scales ranging from hundreds to potentially millions of years. As a result, palaeosols may preserve a valuable record of palaeoclimate , palaeotopography , palaeobiology , palaeodepositional processes, and their changes over time. The integrated study of palaeosols in their depositional context improves knowledge of the dynamic evolution of terrestrial sedimentary successions, and enables prediction of the future behaviour of landscapes. This special issue is divided into two themes and comprises 17 papers that address the wider significance of palaeosols. The first theme exclusively considers the characteristics of palaeosols and uses them as proxies for palaeoenvironmental conditions, especially palaeoclimate factors. Some keys findings include (i) proposals for new climofunctions, based on modern soils with pedogenic carbonate, (ii) critical observations on the chemical pre-treatment of palaeosol samples after application of climofunctions and (iii) climate variations identified by mineralogical, macroscopic and micromorphological evidence in a succession of palaeosol profiles. The second theme considers palaeosols as a tool to understand the relationships between sedimentation and pedogenesis , and its application to define depositional sedimentary architecture and aid sequence stratigraphic interpretations. Some key findings address (i) how tectonic or climatic factors may act to minimise the influence of sea level variations on the characteristics of the palaeosols, and (ii) the importance of understanding lateral variations in the palaeosol profiles before extrapolating results extracted from a single palaeosol profile to the basin scale. As such this special issue highlights the great value of palaeopedology for academic and applied knowledge. ]"

Ask the fish ],"[ It is generally accepted that a climate shift occurred about 1977 that affected the dynamics of North Pacific marine ecosystems. Agreement on the possibility of further climate shifts in 1989 and the late 1990s is yet to be achieved. However, there have been changes in the dynamics of key commercial fishes that indicate changes in their environment occurred in the early 1990s, and possibly around 1998. One method of measuring climate change is to observe the dynamics of species that could be affected. Several studies have described decadal-scale changes in North Pacific climate–ocean conditions. Generally, these studies focus on a single index. Using principal components analysis, we use a composite index based on three aspects of climate ocean conditions: the Aleutian Low Pressure Index, the Pacific Atmospheric Circulation Index and the Pacific Interdecadal Oscillation Index. We link this composite index (Atmospheric Forcing Index) to decadal-scale changes in British Columbia salmon and other fish populations. Around 1989 there was a change from intense Aleutian Lows (above average south-westerly and westerly circulation patterns and warming of coastal sea surface temperatures) to average Aleutian Lows (less frequent south-westerly and westerly circulation and slightly cooler coastal sea surface temperatures in winter). These climate–ocean changes were associated with changes in the abundance and ocean survival of salmon ( Oncorhynchus spp.), distribution and spawning behaviour of hake ( Merluccius productus ) and sardines ( Sardinops sagax ) and in recruitment patterns of several groundfish species. ]"

Cruise ship emissions and practices are reviewed to define environmental impacts. The growing cruising tourism sector has hidden environmental costs. Existing environmental management options are described. An Environmental Impact Matrix is presented for future assesments of the industry. , Cruise tourism is a growing sector of the travel and recreation industry. Due to it mobility it is often one of the first forms of tourism to relocate to new host environments and it is encouraged by transition economies looking to increase foreign revenue. Yet the environmental impacts of cruise vessels on the host environment can be significant, and due to the growth of this sector, it is likely to increase. The Mediterranean is a growing market for cruise tourism. The absence of any international coordination of the industry at the region level leaves it open to exploitation, especially considering the lack of effective pollution control mechanisms in most States. The Adriatic Sea, and Croatia in particular, is of growing interest to the cruise industry. As such Croatia can serve as an example of the strategies and practices that will be implemented as the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean States become more stable and accessible. This work examines cruise ship emissions and impacts, points to existing environmental management options, and opens up the discussion on coastal tourism development as a panacea to the current economic crisis in the region. ]"

Cumulated field data and numerical modeling has facilitated scientific understanding of its hydro-morphodynamics at multiple spatial and time scales, but the changing boundary forcing conditions and increasing anthropogenic influences pose management challenges requiring integrated knowledge. Here we provide a comprehensive synthesis of the multi-scale deltaic hydro-morphodynamics, discuss their relevance and management perspectives in a global context, and identify knowledge gaps for future study. The CD is classified as a river-tide mixed-energy, muddy and highly turbid, fluvio-deltaic composite system involving large-scale land-ocean interacted processes. Its hydro-morphodynamic evolution exhibits profound temporal variations at the fortnightly, seasonal, and inter-annual time scales, and strong spatial variability between tidal river and tidal estuary , and between different distributary channels. As the river-borne sediment has declined &gt;70%, the deltaic morphodynamic adaptation lags behind sediment decline because sediment redistribution within the delta emerges to play a role in sustaining tidal flat accretion. However, the deltaic channels have become narrower, deepened and growingly constrained under cumulated human activities, e.g., extensive embankment and construction of jetties and groins, possibly initiating a decrease in morphodynamic activities and sediment trapping efficiency. Overall, the CD undergoes transitions from net sedimentation and naturally slow morphodynamic adaptation to erosion and human-driven radical adjustment. A shift in management priority from delta development to ecosystem conservation provides an opportunity for restoring the resilience to flooding and erosion hazards. The lessons and identified knowledge gaps inform study and management of worldwide estuaries and deltas undergoing intensified human interferences. ]"

Widespread over-stocking of sheep and clearing for wheat cropping in this period. Pronounced long distance dust transport to coastal cities occurred. Landscapes subjected to extreme erosion, sand drift. USA Dust Bowl and SE Australian ‘Dust Bowl’ shared similar causes, effects. , Australia has an anecdotal history of severe wind erosion and dust storm activity, but there has been no lasting public perception of periods of extreme dust storm activity in this country, such as that developed in the USA following the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Newspaper accounts of droughts and dust storms in southeastern (SE) Australia between 1895 and 1945 suggest that, at various times, the scale of these events was comparable to those experienced in the USA Dust Bowl. During this 50-year period, average annual rainfall values in this region were substantially below long-term averages, air temperatures were distinctly warmer, marginal lands were actively cropped and grazed, and rabbits were a burgeoning grazing pest. From the beginning of the Federation Drought of 1895–1902, dust storm activity increased markedly, with the downwind coastal cities of Sydney and Melbourne experiencing dust hazes, dust storms and falls of red rain relatively regularly. Between 1935 and 1945, Sydney and Melbourne received ten and nine long-distance dust events, respectively, with the years of 1938 and 1944/45 being the most intensely dusty. Entire topsoil horizons were blown away, sand drift was extreme, and crops and sheep flocks were destroyed. Although these periods of extreme dust storm activity were not as sustained as those experienced in the USA in the mid-1930s, there is a strong case to support the contention that SE Australia experienced its own extended, somewhat episodic version of a Dust Bowl, with a similar combination of causal factors and landscape effects. ]"
651,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825217303239,[ Infragravity waves: From driving mechanisms to impacts ],"[ Infragravity (hereafter IG) waves are surface ocean waves with frequencies below those of wind-generated “short waves” (typically below 0.04 Hz). Here we focus on the most common type of IG waves, those induced by the presence of groups in incident short waves. Three related mechanisms explain their generation: (1) the development, shoaling and release of waves bound to the short-wave group envelopes (2) the modulation by these envelopes of the location where short waves break, and (3) the merging of bores (breaking wave front, resembling to a hydraulic jump) inside the surfzone. When reaching shallow water (O(1–10 m)), IG waves can transfer part of their energy back to higher frequencies, a process which is highly dependent on beach slope. On gently sloping beaches, IG waves can dissipate a substantial amount of energy through depth-limited breaking. When the bottom is very rough, such as in coral reef environments, a substantial amount of energy can be dissipated through bottom friction . IG wave energy that is not dissipated is reflected seaward, predominantly for the lowest IG frequencies and on steep bottom slopes. This reflection of the lowest IG frequencies can result in the development of standing (also known as stationary) waves. Reflected IG waves can be refractively trapped so that quasi-periodic along-shore patterns, also referred to as edge waves, can develop. IG waves have a large range of implications in the hydro-sedimentary dynamics of coastal zones. For example, they can modulate current velocities in rip channels and strongly influence cross-shore and longshore mixing. On sandy beaches, IG waves can strongly impact the water table and associated groundwater flows . On gently sloping beaches and especially under storm conditions, IG waves can dominate cross-shore sediment transport , generally promoting offshore transport inside the surfzone. Under storm conditions, IG waves can also induce overwash and eventually promote dune erosion and barrier breaching. In tidal inlets , IG waves can propagate into the back-barrier lagoon during the flood phase and induce large modulations of currents and sediment transport . Their effect appears to be smaller during the ebb phase, due to blocking by countercurrents , particularly in shallow systems. On coral and rocky reefs, IG waves can dominate over short-waves and control the hydro-sedimentary dynamics over the reef flat and in the lagoon . In harbors and semi-enclosed basins, free IG waves can be amplified by resonance and induce large seiches (resonant oscillations). Lastly, free IG waves that are generated in the nearshore can cross oceans and they can also explain the development of the Earth's “hum” (background free oscillations of the solid earth). ]"

Extension and incentives are the main strategies used to improve practices that reduce sediment and nutrient loads.. These strategies are effective if tailored to diverse farmers’ needs; are collaboratively delivered; and regularly evaluated Future progress can be made by engaging supply chains; addressing cultural barriers; and enhancing place-based delivery. , The health of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is rapidly declining, driven by multiple stressors including land-based impacts on water quality. For over fifteen years Australian Governments have been investing in programs to promote the voluntary adoption of agricultural practices that reduce nutrient, pesticide and sediment runoff. Insights from monitoring, modelling and research have been used to progressively refine and focus investments over time. Despite this, progress is clearly inadequate to achieve the ambitious program targets. More recently, policy makers have introduced new targets to enhance the active engagement of communities and land managers in programs to improve water quality outcomes. In this review article, we draw on the empirical evidence from the social science literature available from studies within the Great Barrier Reef catchments and consider implications for the current approach being used in Reef programs. Adopting a qualitative evidence synthesis approach, the review examines a nested set of themes: from landholder decision making on practice adoption; participation and engagement in programs; and the influence of the broader policy settings and instruments to deliver government plans and investment. The review highlights the influence of factors such diverse landholder goals and motivations, social and cultural risks of participation, and the benefits of knowledge exchange over knowledge transfer in building trust and commitment amongst landholders. The review also highlights the importance of maintaining collaboration and capacity in industry and natural resource management networks, and, committing to active experimentation and learning at both the farm and program levels. Critical knowledge gaps include the potential for greater participation of supply chain and private actors in program delivery, including exploring the efficacy of ‘smart’ regulation responses, and the impact of re-emergent place-based models for implementation. ]"

A list of indicator variables is suggested for conservation managers. Assessment criteria based on spatial extent lack diagnostic power and may over-estimate risk of collapse. Assessment criteria focused on community structure and functioning more robust. , Estuarine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by coastal development and climate change. The large number of estuaries globally necessitates risk assessment to prioritise conservation efforts. Schemes for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse have been designed around terrestrial ecosystems , often defined by a single characteristic vegetation type, with their applicability to estuaries unclear. Here we consider the causes and symptoms of estuarine ecosystem collapse and assess, using a case study of the Chesapeake Bay, the applicability of ecosystem-level risk assessments to estuarine ecosystems, typified by mosaics of habitats. Functional estuaries are characterised by habitat heterogeneity and connectivity, maintenance of constituent habitats through recruitment, and a complex trophic structure including apex predators. Additionally, primary production and biomass are dominated by benthic, as opposed to pelagic, species. Hence, homogenisation of habitat types, decreased connectivity, recruitment failure, loss of apex predators and a decreased ratio of benthic to pelagic biomass may be symptoms of a trajectory towards collapse. In terrestrial ecosystems, criteria used for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse include declining or restricted distribution of ecosystems, degradation of the abiotic environment , changes in species composition and declining ecological function. As the boundaries of estuaries are typically defined by topography, rarely do significant changes in the area of the ecosystem occur. Furthermore, because the extent of estuaries is typically small, assessments based on area of occupancy may over-inflate risk. Instead, criteria based on abiotic and biotic changes, many of which are documented through monitoring programs, may be most useful for risk assessments of estuarine ecosystems. ]"

However, anthropogenic activities and climate change impacts are driving changes in the distributions and population dynamics of these animals, with negative consequences for ecosystem functioning. Across mid-latitude shelf-seas marine mammals and seabirds are known to forage across a number of oceanographic habitats that structure the spatio-temporal distributions of prey fields. Knowledge of these and the bio-physical mechanisms driving such associations are needed to improve marine management and policy. Here, we provide a concise and easily accessible guide for both researchers and managers of marine systems on the predominant oceanographic habitats that are favoured for foraging by marine mammals and seabirds across mid-latitude shelf-seas. We (1) identify and describe key discrete physical features present across the continental shelf , working inshore from the shelf-edge to the shore line, (2) provide an overview of findings relating to associations between these habitats and marine mammals and seabirds, (3) identify areas for future research and (4) discuss the relevance of such information to conservation management . We show that oceanographic features preferentially foraged at by marine mammals and seabirds include shelf-edge fronts, upwelling and tidal-mixing fronts, offshore banks and internal waves, regions of stratification, and topographically complex coastal areas subject to strong tidal flow. Whilst associations were variable across taxa and through space and time, in the majority of cases interactions between bathymetry and tidal currents appear to play a dominant role, alongside patterns in seasonal stratification and shelf-edge upwelling. We suggest that the ecological significance of these bio-physical structures stems from a capacity to alter the densities, distributions (both horizontally and vertically) and/or behaviours of prey in a persistent and/or predictable manner that increases accessibility for predators, and likely enhances foraging efficiency . Future conservation management should aim to preserve and protect these habitats. This will require adaptive and holistic strategies that are specifically tailored to the characteristics of an oceanographic feature, and where necessary, evolve through space and time in response to spatio-temporal variability. Improved monitoring of animal movements and bio-physical conditions across shelf-seas would aid in this. Areas for future research include multi-disciplinary/trophic studies of the mechanisms linking bio-physical processes, prey and marine mammals and seabirds (which may elucidate the importance of lesser studied features such as bottom fronts and Langmuir circulation cells), alongside a better understanding of how predators perceive their environment and develop foraging strategies during immature/juvenile stages. Estimates of the importance of oceanographic habitat features at a population level should also be obtained. Such information is vital to ensuring the future health of these complex ecosystems, and can be used to assess how anthropogenic activities and future environmental changes will impact the functioning and spatio-temporal dynamics of these bio-physical features and their use by marine predators. ]"

Underexplored indicators hold potential for future studies and management themes. , Sustainable production of fish and seafood products contributes to achieving the economic, social, and environmental goals in fisheries. Different sustainability strategies are applied to achieve these three goals. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the status and implementation of various sustainable fishery management strategies in the Philippines over the past 20 years. We identified various management themes and the extent these themes are related to economic, social and environmental sustainability goals using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) and text mining. Six sustainability management themes were identified. The analysis shows that overall, the sustainability management themes appear to be socio-economic in nature based on the relative occurrences of indicators belonging to the three sustainability goals. When comparing the strength of the three sustainability goals in each management theme, the social goal appears to be most prominent in four management themes, the economic goal in one theme, and a balance of the three sustainability goals in another theme. Furthermore, this study shows which fishery management themes are most (dis-)similar based on clustering. Policy makers and other fishery management bodies can use these insights to optimize the sustainability goals in fisheries by not only relying on a single management theme in each fishery, by improving focus on large scale fishers, by incorporating underexplored sustainability indicators, and by adapting current trends and proven-to-be effective management themes. ]"

Microbial water quality of sources responds to individual rainfall events. Substantial evidence of increasing risk of cyanobacteria and saltwater intrusion . Sparse literature on climate impacts on geogenic contaminants. , Understanding how climate change will affect water quality and therefore, health, is critical for building resilient water services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the effect of climate change will be felt most acutely. Evidence of the effect of climate variables such as temperate and rainfall on water quality can generate insights into the likely impact of future climate change. While the seasonal effects on water quality are known, and there is strong qualitative evidence that climate change will impact water quality, there are no reviews that synthesise quantitative evidence from LMICs on links between climate variables and water quality. We mapped the available evidence on a range of climate exposures and water quality outcomes and identified 98 peer-reviewed studies. This included observational studies on the impact of temperature and rainfall events (which may cause short-term changes in contaminant concentrations), and modelling studies on the long-term impacts of sea level rise. Evidence on links between antecedent rainfall and microbiological contamination of water supplies is strong and relatively evenly distributed geographically, but largely focused on faecal indicator bacteria and on untreated shallow groundwater sources of drinking water. The literature on climate effects on geogenic contaminants was sparse. There is substantial research on the links between water temperature and cyanobacteria blooms in surface waters, although most studies were from two countries and did not examine potential effects on water treatment. Similarly, studies modelling the impact of sea level rise on groundwater salinity, mostly from south-Asia and the Middle East, did not discuss challenges for drinking water supplies. We identified key future research priorities based on this review. These include: more studies on specific pathogens (including opportunistic pathogens) in water supplies and their relationships with climate variables; more studies that assess likely relationships between climate variables and water treatment processes; studies into the relationships between climate variables and geogenic contaminants, including risks from heavy metals released as glacier retreat; and, research into the impacts of wildfires on water quality in LMICs given the current dearth of studies but recognised importance. ]"

The main foundation concepts from ecology and evolutionary biology which have led only recently to an improved conception of landform dynamics in geomorphology are reviewed and discussed. The biogeomorphologic macroevolutionary insights proposed explicitly integrate geomorphologic niche-dimensions and processes within an ecosystem framework and reflect current theories of eco-evolutionary and ecological processes.

The amount of information as well as the emphasis of the science contained in these 273 references differs greatly between documents. A meta-analysis of this collective scholarship shows six principal areas of scientific endeavour: (i) observation and cataloguing of modern and historical tsunami impacts caused by earthquakes and landslides, (ii) modelling and evaluation of near- and far-field generated tsunamis, (iii) detailed mapping and assessment of offshore seismic and other geological structures responsible for near-field tsunami generation, (iv) investigation and cross-referencing of Holocene palaeo-records of tsunami deposits preserved in wetlands, dunes and other coastal landforms , (v) survey and reconnaissance of modern and historical tsunami impacts, and (vi) guidance for tsunami hazard mitigation, preparedness and land-use planning. Synthesising all of these references, it is clear that A–NZ has been affected by remote, regional and locally generated tsunami during the historic, pre-written and pre-human periods.

An investigation of atmospheric turbidity has been undertaken in Kerkennah Island (in Tunisia). Turbidity indexes, namely, Linke factor (T L ) and Angstrom coefficient (β) were derived directly from measurements taken by pyrheliometer during a year: July (2008) to June (2009). Data obtained from these measurements in this area were compared with measurements performed in a coastal and urban region (Sidi Bou Said) located in the North of Tunisia. A comparison of the seasonal cycle of turbidity at both sites showed: *) maximum values of turbidity in the summer due to dust storms, vertical convection and breeze sea circulation; *) Values of turbidity decrease in the autumn season, due to the decreasing of days of Sirocco and to the increasing of amount of rainfall; *) low values of turbidity index in the winter, due to precipitation removal as well as relative humidity-impacted deposition; *) middle values of turbidity were observed in the spring season. Monthly, diurnal, hourly mean values and frequency of occurrence of the value of each turbidity index were used to characterize variations of atmospheric turbidity. The three-hourly standard meteorological data given by the Meteorological National Institute (Sfax) represent a valuable supplement to the data sets with the pyrheliometer measurements. The analysis of the results shows that there is a high correlation between atmospheric turbidity and local weather conditions, especially temperature and wind speed. The correlation of meteorological parameters (wind speed and temperature) with the turbidity coefficients was analyzed and discussed. ]"

The cruises were all carried out during periods of high river flow, but under different climatological conditions with 1997 conditions described as relatively typical or ‘neutral/normal’, compared to the El Niño warmer water temperatures in 1998, and the cooler La Niña conditions in 1999. Near-shore sea-surface temperatures ranged from cold (9.5–10.5°C) during La Niña 1999, to average (11–13°C) during 1997 to warm (13.5–15°C) during El Niño 1998. Nutrients are supplied to the Gulf of the Farallones both from San Francisco Bay (SFB) and from oceanic sources, e.g. coastal upwelling near Point Reyes. Nutrient supplies are strongly influenced by the seasonal cycle of fall calms, with storms (commencing in January), and the spring transition to high pressure and northerly upwelling favorable winds. The major effect of El Niño and La Niña climatic conditions was to modulate the relative contribution of SFB to nutrient concentrations in the coastal waters of the Gulf of the Farallones; this was intensified during the El Niño winter and reduced during La Niña. During January 1998 (El Niño) the oceanic water was warm and had low or undetectable nitrate, that did not reach the coast. Instead, SFB dominated the supply of nutrients to the coastal waters. Additionally, these data indicate that silicate may be a good tracker of SFB water. In January, delta outflow into SFB produces low salinity, high silicate, high nitrate water that exits the bay at the Golden Gate and is advected northward along the coast. This occurred in both 1997 and 1998. However during January 1999, a La Niña, this SFB feature was reduced and the near-shore water was more characteristic of high salinity oceanic water penetrated all the way to the coast and was cold (10°C) and nutrient rich (16 μM NO 3 , 30 μM Si(OH) 4 ). January chlorophyll concentrations ranged from 1–1.5 μg l −1 in all years with the highest values measured in 1999 (2.5–3 μg l −1 ) as a result of elevated nutrients in the area. The impact of climatic conditions on chlorophyll concentrations was not as pronounced as might be expected from the high temperatures and low nutrient concentrations measured offshore during El Niño due to the sustained supply of nutrients from the Bay supporting continued primary production. ]"

Following the termination of the CSK in 1979, each MS continued the work to advance ocean science. The results of scientific studies of the Kuroshio and its adjacent regions have been published by various experts including many from the MSs of the WESTPAC; however, to-date, there has been no systematic approach to the research of the Kuroshio and its adjacent regions. This review considered the Kuroshio from the regional perspective of experts of the MSs, that is, from the perspectives of MSs, science, and the future prospects. Experts from each MS reviewed past activities and contributions and reviewed the knowledge gaps in the fields of physical, biological, and biogeochemical science. Many scientific questions remain regarding the path of the Kuroshio from south to north, as well as associated phenomena, including mesoscale eddies and fronts, the important roles of ocean variations in adjacent regions, and the different roles and mechanisms of air–sea interactions in low- and mid-latitude areas. Despite considerable effort by many biologists, substantial gaps remain in our biological knowledge of the region. The Kuroshio and its adjacent regions comprise one of the areas of the world with high biodiversity; however, there has been insufficient research into what is the cause of this high biodiversity. From a biogeochemical aspect, high-resolution spatiotemporal observations will be required to understand interactions with physical processes both in the Kuroshio region and in the marginal seas . It has been highlighted that long-term fixed-location observations will be needed to understand the key mechanisms of biogeochemical processes, particularly in relation to climate change. Finally, the report summarized the future perspectives. Based on recognition of the current circumstances and with acknowledgment of the potential short-term future capabilities of MSs, the possible uses of new technologies and frameworks were discussed. Since the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , which came into force in 1994, it has been difficult to conduct observations in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of other regional states. Thus, new frameworks and/or technologies will be needed to ensure the success of future studies of the Kuroshio. ]"

Here we present key geologic evidence to reassess first-order features of geomorphology and tectonics across the Central Andes, where the orogen includes the Altiplano Plateau and attains its maximum integrated height and width. The Andean subduction margin has a stepped morphology dominated by the low-relief Atacama Bench, which is similar to a giant uplifted terrace, slopes gently over a width of 60–100 km from the Andes to the Pacific, and runs over more than 1000 km of coastal length. We find that the genesis of stepped morphology at the Andean seaboard is due to concomitant development of large west-vergent thrusts parallel to the subduction interface and increasing aridity in the Atacama Desert, which keeps an unprecedented large-scale record of interplaying tectonics and Cenozoic climate change. Incorporating our results with published geological knowledge demonstrates that Andean orogeny is characterized by trench-perpendicular (bivergent) and trench-parallel (bilateral) growth over the past 50 Myr, associated with positive trench velocity toward the continent (trench advance) and subduction of a wide slab under South America. We hypothesize that a global plate tectonic reorganization involving long-lasting viscous mantle flow has probably forced both, Andean orogeny and global climate cooling since ~ 50 Ma. In contrast, two important stepwise pulses of increasing aridity and trench-perpendicular Andean growth appear to be results of changes in erosion rates due to global Late Eocene and Middle Miocene cooling events. ]"

The southern Caribbean area has been considered the cradle of Neotropical mangroves. These inferences were based mainly on qualitative evidence, such as the presence/absence of fossils showing botanical affinities with present-day mangrove taxa. However, as demonstrated in Quaternary paleoecology , the most suitable approach for reconstructing past plant communities is the assemblage approach, which is based on quantitative palynology. Therefore, the problem of the origin of Caribbean mangroves, as ecological communities, is addressed here by reviewing in detail the Late Cretaceous to Eocene quantitative palynological studies available for the region to properly reconstruct past mangrove assemblages. No evidence has been found for the occurrence of mangrove ecosystems during the Late Cretaceous and the Paleocene, only records of the fossil representatives of some individual taxa ( Nypa , Acrostichum ), which are not mangrove-forming elements and, hence, are not reliable indicators of mangrove communities. The first robust evidence of true mangrove communities was found in the Middle Eocene (Lutetian). These mangrove communities were dominated by the fossil representative of Pelliciera , a mangrove-forming tree with a Neotropical distribution by that time. Back-mangrove communities were dominated by the palm Nypa (which was pantropical by that time but is now restricted to the Indo-Malayan region), the fern Acrostichum and palms, notably Mauritia , along a sea-land saline to freshwater community gradient. Pelliciera originated in the southern Caribbean during the Early Eocene and became dominant in the Middle Eocene, when it dispersed across the Caribbean area, probably favored by the migration of the Caribbean plate . Therefore, the first Caribbean mangroves were ecological and evolutionary innovations that emerged de novo during the Eocene, rather than a consequence of the regional evolutionary differentiation from hypothetical Late Cretaceous Tethyan mangroves, whose existence is not supported by quantitative palynological records. It is proposed to develop this type of study for other tropical/subtropical mangrove communities, for a sounder view of mangrove origin and evolution, at a global scale. ]"

The ocean probably formed following 3-way rifting between Laurentia , Baltica , and Amazonia – West Africa (a block that became incorporated in Gondwana). Closure of the ocean trapped numerous terranes during the development of the Appalachian–Caledonide Orogen. Subsequent deformation, including late Paleozoic strike slip, transpression , and transtension , and Mesozoic stretching during Pangea breakup, must be taken into account in models for orogen development. Traditional analyses of Iapetan terranes have focussed on Cambrian sedimentary successions, and on isotopic criteria, to classify terranes into larger domains: Ganderia, Avalonia and Megumia. Detrital zircon data show that these domains did not cross the Iapetus as single entities, while paleomagnetic data reveal significant vertical-axis terrane rotations. We here review and interpret 17 paleomagnetic poles and &gt;350 published detrital zircon data sets from the northern Appalachians and western Caledonides, using consistent and rigorous criteria for the selection and presentation of data. We place these data on an integrated stratigraphic chart to show timing relations and to seek constraints on the provenance and travel of terranes in the Iapetus Ocean. We distinguish groups of terranes that likely travelled together as terrane assemblages. In the Taconian/Grampian Orogeny, Furongian to Katian continent–arc collision involved off-margin blocks along the hyperextended Laurentian margin. In New England, early Taconian collision by 475 Ma involved the Gondwana-derived Moretown assemblage. An assemblage of the Bronson and Popelogan arc terranes probably arrived at the main Laurentian margin 25-30 Myr later. Subduction polarity reversal then led to the progressive accretion of additional terrane assemblages (Salinian Orogeny). The Miramichi–Victoria assemblage arrived close to the Ordovician–Silurian boundary. The Miramichi terrane underwent partial subduction in the Québec re-entrant, whereas the Victoria terrane was juxtaposed with the Newfoundland promontory without major metamorphism . In mid-Silurian time, an assemblage including the Gander terrane of Newfoundland and related portions of Britain and Ireland was accreted to Laurentia, along with Baltica (Scandian Orogeny). The St. Croix – La Poile assemblage may have been accreted slightly later, but is distinguished by the development of a Silurian arc–backarc system (coastal igneous belt) above a northwest-dipping subduction zone . The Avalon–Brookville assemblage encountered this system in Přídolí to Middle Devonian time (Acadian Orogeny), leading to the collapse of the backarc basin and northwest-vergent thrust emplacement onto Laurentia during sinistral transpression in the Appalachian Orogen. Acadian deformation involved mainly sinistral strike slip in Britain and Ireland. Several of the terranes that were accreted to the Laurentian margin carried internal records of earlier deformation that took place near Amazonia – West Africa in Early Ordovician time and earlier (Monian/Penobscottian Orogeny). The Iapetus Ocean thus contained a complex array of terranes, small ocean basins, arcs, and previously emplaced ophiolites analogous to modern southeast Asia. It closed to form a complex array of sutures in an orogen within which no single Iapetus suture can be clearly identified. ]"

Geomorphic evidence suggests Cenozoic rejuvenation of Appalachian topography. Geomorphic disequilibrium may also result from complex boundary conditions. Evidence exists for broad impact of basin reorganization and climate change. Heterogeneity of exhuming bedrock may also lead to perpetual disequilibrium. , Despite vast scientific inquiry, the evolution of Appalachian Mountain topography in eastern North America has yet to be robustly explained. After a century and a half of investigation, two end member visions have developed to explain its geomorphic origins. One view holds that topographic remnants of the Paleozoic orogen were eroded away and that the modern mountains are explained by Cenozoic topographic rejuvenation from crustal tectonics or mantle dynamics . The alternative vision is the mountains are supported by a lingering Paleozoic crustal root , but are actively shaped by erosional processes and their adjustment to changing boundary conditions. In this review, we first examine the observations and interpretations that comprise the vision of active Cenozoic rejuvenation. Although there is considerable evidence for tectonic deformation, mantle support, and topographic disequilibrium , the interpretations are non-unique and universal signals have yet to emerge. Next, we explore the alternative view by examining how the signals of topographic disequilibrium may be explained without invoking rejuvenation. We present evidence, including new examples, for landscape unsteadiness due to basin reorganization, climate change, and the three-dimensional complexity of exhuming bedrock of variable erodibility . These factors can force continual topographic and erosional adjustment. This complexity-driven disequilibrium yields geomorphic noise that can mimic signals of active uplift, but does not preclude Cenozoic rejuvenation. We conclude that is it not yet possible to quantify the effects of any one specific variable on the modern landscape, but stress the importance of a holistic investigative approach that accounts for the innate complexity of the system. ]"

Most climate models forecast an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation at the end of the 21st century. This will enhance stress on natural forests and shrubs, and will result in more water consumption, evapotranspiration , and probably interception , which will affect the surface water balance and the partitioning of precipitation between evapotranspiration, runoff, and groundwater flow . As a consequence, soil water content will decline, saturation conditions will be increasingly rare and restricted to periods in winter and spring, and snow accumulation and melting will change, especially in the mid-mountain areas. Future land management will be characterized by forest and shrub expansion in most Mediterranean mountain areas, as a consequence of farmland and grazing abandonment, with increasing human pressure localized only in some places (ski resort and urbanized of valley floors). In the lowlands, particularly in the coastal fringe, increasing water demand will occur as a consequence of expansion of irrigated lands, as well as the growth of urban and industrial areas, and tourist resorts. Future scenarios for water resources in the Mediterranean region suggest (1) a progressive decline in the average streamflow (already observed in many rivers since the 1980s), including a decline in the frequency and magnitude of the most frequent floods due to the expansion of forests; (2) changes in important river regime characteristics, including an earlier decline in high flows from snowmelt in spring, an intensification of low flows in summer, and more irregular discharges in winter; (3) changes in reservoir inputs and management, including lower available discharges from dams to meet the water demand from irrigated and urban areas. Most reservoirs in mountain areas will be subject to increasing water resource uncertainty, because of the reduced influence of snow accumulation and snowmelt processes. Besides, reservoir capacity is naturally reduced due to increasing sedimentation and, in some cases, is also decreased to improve the safety control of floods, leading to a reduction in efficiency for agriculture. And (4) hydrological and population changes in coastal areas, particularly in the delta zones, affected by water depletion, groundwater reduction and saline water intrusion. These scenarios enhance the necessity of improving water management, water prizing and water recycling policies, in order to ensure water supply and to reduce tensions among regions and countries. ]"

The studied events occurred between the Neoaptian and Neoalbian (Mid Cretaceous). They are related to the Gondwana breakup and associated with deep climatic changes. Data were analyzed from five intervals following the Brazilian palynological zoning. Late Albian probably represents the hottest interval of the entire studied section. , The eastern, equatorial and interior basins from Northeastern Brazil contain a diverse sedimentary record representative of the events that culminated in the rupture of the Gondwana megacontinent and the genesis of the South Atlantic Ocean. Those events that occurred between the Neoaptian and Neoalbian (Mid cretaceous) were associated with deep climatic changes that, besides involving particular depositional systems from continental to lacustrine-evaporitic-open marine, allowed the development of a wide and diversified vegetation adapted to the new ecological niches then created. Paleobotanical data were analyzed from five intervals defined according to the Brazilian palynological zoning. The middle section of the Upper Aptian (P-260) suggests the existence of highlands with cold to hot but dry climate in the interior basins, with high humidity in the interior plains and stressful conditions along the coast. Warmer, but not arid climate prevailed on the east margin, being even hotter and arid on the equatorial margin. The Upper Aptian (P-270) is suggestive of highlands in the interior basins and at the eastern and equatorial margins, with hot and humid climate in the interior basins and the eastern margin. The climate would be significantly more arid in the equatorial margin, where coastal evaporitic systems would have been developed. From the Neoaptian (P-280) the records for the interior basins are not significant. For the eastern and equatorial margin basins would persist the presence of highlands, with a mild climate, with frequent humid, locally hot and arid environments , but not stressful. During early Albian (P-320), the phytogeographic distribution reflects a significant climate change in the east and equatorial margins, with a marked reduction of humidity and reduction or absence of highlands. The climate would have been warm, with increasing aridity and presence of more stressful environments. During Mid Albian (P-330), the highlands would no longer exist on the eastern and equatorial margins, the climate being predominantly hot and dry, but milder on the eastern margin, while on the equatorial margin there would be an increase in aridity from east to west. During the late Albian (P-355 / P-360), in addition to the absence of highlands, the phytogeographic distribution suggests the maintenance of a hot and arid climate, probably representing the hottest climate of the entire studied section ]"

Most of the basic principles of inorganic-chemical hydrogeology were first established by investigations of organic-free, regional-scale systems for which simplifying assumptions could be made. The problems of groundwater contamination are causing a shift of emphasis to microscale systems that are dominated by organic-chemical reactions and that are providing an impetus for the study of naturally occurring and manmade organic material. Along with the decrease in scale, physical and chemical heterogeneity become major controls. Current investigations and those selected from the literature demonstrate that heterogeneity increases in importance as the study site decreases from regional-scale to macroscale to microscale. Increased understanding of regional-scale flow systems is demonstrated by selection of investigations of carbonate and volcanic aquifers to show how application of present-day concepts and techniques can identify controlling chemical reactions and determine their rates; identify groundwater flow paths and determine flow velocity; and determine aquifer characteristics. The role of chemical hydrogeology in understanding geologic processes of macroscale systems is exemplified by selection of investigations in coastal aquifers. Phenomena associated with the mixing zone generated by encroaching sea water include an increase in heterogeneity of permeability, diagenesis of minerals, and formation of geomorphic features, such as caves, lagoons, and bays. Ore deposits of manganese and uranium, along with a simulation model of ore-forming fluids, demonstrate the influence of heterogeneity and of organic compounds on geochemical reactions associated with genesis of mineral deposits. In microscale environments, importance of heterogeneity and consequences of organic reactions in determining the distributions and concentrations cf. constituents are provided by several studies, including infiltration of sewage effluent and migration of creosote in coastal plain aquifers. These studies show that heterogeneity and the dominance of organically controlled reactions greatly increase the complexity of investigations. ]"

This network of zooplankton time-series stations has enabled us to collect and synthesise seasonal and multi-annual data on abundance, body size, fecundity, hatching success and vertical distribution of C. helgolandicus . An aim was to enable comparison with its congener Calanus finmarchicus , which has been studied intensively as a key component of European and north east Atlantic marine ecosystems. C. finmarchicus is known to over-winter at depth, whereas the life-cycle of C. helgolandicus is less well understood. Overwintering populations of C. helgolandicus have been observed off the Atlantic coast between 400 and 800 m, while in the Mediterranean there is evidence of significant deep-water populations at depths as great as 4200 m. The biogeographical distribution of C. helgolandicus in European coastal waters covers a wide range of habitats, from open ocean to coastal environments, and its contribution to mesozooplankton biomass ranges from 6% to 93%. Highest abundances were recorded in the Adriatic and off the west coast of Spain. C. helgolandicus is generally found in 9–20 °C water, with maximum abundances from 13–17 °C. In contrast, C. finmarchicus is found in cooler water between 0 and 15 °C, with peak abundances from 0 to 9 °C. As water has warmed in the North Atlantic over recent decades, the range of C. helgolandicus and its abundance on the fringes of its expanding range have increased. This review will facilitate development of population models of C. helgolandicus . This will not only help answer remaining questions but will improve our ability to forecast future changes, in response to a warming climate, in the abundance and distribution of this important species. ]"

UV and UV-AOPs can mineralize I-DBPs and liberate halides . UV can reduce IO 3 − IO 3 − to I – , leading to I-DBP formation in subsequent disinfection. , Iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs) formed in water treatment are of emerging concern due to their high toxicity and the tase-and-odor problems associated with iodinated trihalomethanes (I-THMs). Iodoacetic acid and dichloroiodomethane are currently regulated in Shenzhen, China and the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China has also been considering regulating I-DBPs. Iodide (I – ), organoiodine compounds (e.g., iodinated X-ray contrast media [ICM]), and iodate (IO 3 – ) are the three common iodine sources in aquatic environment that lead to I-DBP formation. While UV irradiation effectively inactivate a wide range of microorganisms in water, it induces the transformation of these iodine sources, enabling the formation of I-DBPs. This review focuses on the fate and transformation of these iodine sources in UV-based water treatment (i.e., UV irradiation and UV-based advanced oxidation processes [UV-AOPs]) and the formation of I-DBPs in post-disinfection. I – released in UV-based treatments of ICM and can be oxidized in subsequent disinfection to hypoiodous acid (HOI), which reacts with natural organic matter (NOM) to produce I-DBPs. Both UV and UV-AOPs are not able to fully mineralize ICM and completely oxidize the released I – to (except UV/O 3 ). Results reveal that UV and UV-AOPs are adequate for I-DBP degradation but require high UV doses. While the ideal I-DBP mitigation strategy awaits to be developed, understanding their sources and formation pathways aids in informed selections of water treatment processes, empowers water suppliers to meet drinking water standards, and minimizes consumers’ exposure to I-DBPs. ]"

Each tectonic event resulted in the arrival of quartz-rich deposits on the oceanic units and in a sedimentary hiatus in the backarc zone (Oriente basin), which both indicate an uplift of the South-American continental margin . This is interpreted as the underplating of oceanic terranes beneath the Andean continental margin. After the Incaic contractional phase (~40 Ma), the Oriente Basin recorded a sharp increase in the subsidence rate, the westward migration of the depocenters and a drastic change in the detrital source around 25 Ma, which indicate the onset of its foreland basin evolution, driven by flexural subsidence . It is therefore proposed that the Ecuadorian Andes resulted first from the evolution of a western, west-verging orogenic wedge, made of accreted oceanic material (~75–40 Ma). Once this western wedge overthickened and submitted to strong vertical body forces, the strain related to ocean-continent convergence was transmitted to the continental plate, where a second, eastern, east-verging orogenic wedge formed about 25 Ma ago. This scenario accounts for the tectonic and sedimentary evolution of the Ecuadorian-north Peruvian margin, and explains why, in spite of a moderate elevation, the partly oceanic crustal root of the Ecuadorian Andes, is almost as thick as beneath the high-altitude Altiplano of southern Peru and Bolivia, where the crustal root is mainly of continental nature. ]"

We present a reconstruction of the spatial and temporal variability of these inputs since the early 1960s, based on a review of available data on water discharge, nutrient concentrations and climatic parameters. Our compilation indicates that Mediterranean rivers suffer from a significant reduction in freshwater discharge, contrary to rivers of the Black Sea, which do not have clear discharge trends. We estimate this reduction to be at least about 20% between 1960 and 2000. It mainly reflects recent climate change, and dam construction may have reduced discharge even further. A similar decrease can also be expected for the fluxes of dissolved silica (Si), strongly controlled by water discharge and potentially reduced by river damming as well. This contrasts with the fluxes of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in Mediterranean and Black Sea rivers, which were strongly enhanced by anthropogenic sources. Their total inputs to the Mediterranean Sea could have increased by a factor of &gt;5. While N still remained at elevated levels in 2000, P only increased up to the 1980–1990s, and then rapidly dropped down to about the initial values of the 1960s. With respect to the marine primary production that can be supported by the riverine nutrient inputs, Mediterranean and the Black Sea rivers were mostly phosphorus limited during the study period. Their anthropogenic nutrient enrichment could only have had a fertilizing effect before the general decline of the P loads. When also considering Si as a limiting element, which is the case for siliceous primary producers such as diatoms, silica limitation may have become a widespread phenomenon in the Mediterranean rivers since the early 1980s. For the Black Sea rivers, this already started the late 1960s. Gross primary production sustained by rivers (PPR) represents only less than 2% of the gross production (PP) in the Mediterranean, and less than 5% in the Black Sea. Possible ecological impacts of the changing river inputs should therefore be visible only in productive coastal areas, such as the Gulf of Lions, where PPR can reach more than two thirds of PP. Reported ecosystem changes both in the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea are concomitant with major changes in the reconstructed river inputs. Further work combining modelling and data collection is needed to test whether this may also have been the case for coastal ecosystems at other places in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. ]"

This can be done rationally at two levels: into four primary ecological domains (three oceanic and one coastal), or about fifty biogeochemical provinces. The domains differ in their characteristic seasonal cycles of stability, nutrient supply and illumination, while provinces are defined by ocean currents, fronts, topography and recurrent features in the sea surface chlorophyll field. For each of these compartments, seasonal cycles of photic depth, primary production and accumulation (or loss) of algal biomass were obtained from the climatological CZCS chlorophyll field and other data and these, together with mixed layer depths, rendered characteristic seasonal cycles of production and consumption, which can be grouped into eight models: i — polar irradiance-mediated production peak; ii — nutrient-limited spring production peak; iii — winter-spring production with nutrient limitation; iv — small amplitude response to trade wind seasonality; v — large amplitude response to monsoon reversal; vi — canonical spring-fall blooms of mid-latitude continental shelves; vii — topography-forced summer production; viii — intermittent production at coastal divergences. For higher latitudes, these models suggest that the observed late-summer ‘blooms’ result not from a renewal of primary production rate, but from a relaxation of grazing pressure; in mid-latitudes, the observed ‘winter’ bloom represents chlorophyll accumulation at a season when loss terms are apparently smaller than during the period of peak primary production rate which occurs later, in spring. Where an episodic seasonal increase in rate of primary production occurs, as in the Arabian Sea, algal biomass accumulation may brief, lasting only until consumption is fully re-established. Only in the low latitude oligotrophic ocean are production and consumption perennially and closely coupled. ]"

The hot spots of these processes are located at the Darss Sill and the Bornholm Channel in the western Baltic Sea. In the central Baltic Sea the horizontal advection of saline water in deep layers below the permanent halocline dominate the temporal changes and associated transports. This is accompanied by the turbulent vertical transport through the halocline into the surface layers. The related vertical salt transport into the entire surface mixed layer estimated by various methods is slightly above 30 kg/(m 2 a). During stagnation periods, the residence time of the deep water in the Eastern Gotland Basin increases roughly by a factor of five. Vertical mixing through the halocline is drastically reduced when inflows are lacking, the potential processes of diapycnal mixing are discussed to the present knowledge. The turbulent motion resulting from breaking internal waves is capable of turbulent transports through the halocline corresponding to the estimates of the salt transport into the surface mixed layer. The actual knowledge about boundary mixing due to internal waves in the Baltic Sea is poor. Mesoscale eddies may contribute to the vertical mixing, but it is not known whether they really do and which of the possible direct and indirect mixing mechanisms is most effective. Near-bottom currents induced by inflow events likely enhance vertical mixing. Coastal upwelling certainly contributes to the vertical transport, but the depth of its origin and the volume transport are hard to determine for large-scale quantifications. The short spatiotemporal scale of turbulent transports through the halocline resulting in a weakening of the halocline during summer together with the mixing of the entire surface layer down to the halocline in winter form a consistent description of the vertical salt transport. It is hypothesised that the longer residence time of the deep water during stagnation periods results from the lack of energy imported by the inflows and directly or indirectly feeding the diapycnal mixing processes. The vertical transport of nutrients such as the phosphate is quantitatively not sufficiently understood and needs further interdisciplinary research activities. ]"

The satellite data are especially helpful in capturing rapid sub-mesoscale motions insufficiently resolved by the in situ measurements. Various forms of isolated features, including dipole eddies and river plumes, are identified in the satellite images. Unstable flow structures at these sites appear to transport materials and momentum across the continental shelf. Species differentiation and competition are evident along the boundary current system and at the frontal regions during the development of early summer productivity. A time series of Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) images indicate dynamical modulation of the springtime surface productivity in the southern Black Sea. Unstable meandering motions generated at Sakarya Canyon propagate east with speeds of ∼10–15 km d −1 . Within weeks, a turbulent jet is created which separates from the coast, covering the entire southwestern sector. The nutrients driving the phytoplankton production (mainly Emiliana huxleyi ) of the current system evidently originate from fluvial discharge entering from the northwestern region including the Danube river. The productivity pattern develops in early summer when the Danube inflow is at its peak, and through meandering motions spreads into an area several times wider than the continental shelf. In 1980, the CZCS data, and in 1991 and 1992, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data indicate patches of upwelling along the west Anatolian coastline between Sakarya Canyon and Cape İnce ( Ince Burun ) in summer. The upwelling phenomenon is outstanding because it occurs on a coast where normally the surface convergence near the coast implies downwelling, and under conditions of unfavorable winds. In 1992, the hydrographic data indicated the upwelling to be the result of a surface divergence of the boundary current, and sequences of satellite data indicate the role of transient dynamics. The in situ data showed the upwelling centres to be devoid of phytoplankton as well as fish eggs and larvae. The AVHRR and in situ hydrographic data in winter 1990 indicate cold water is formed over the entire western Black Sea continental shelf. The band of cold water decreases in width as it moves south and impinges on the headland at Baba Burnu, where it undergoes a sudden expansion. The maximum winter phytoplankton bloom sampled during the same period indicates explosive populations of diatoms following the band of cold water. ]"

The first approach concerns the monitoring of contemporary processes and environments, and the second concerns the application of insights gained on these to the interpretation of past process regimes and associated products. Technological improvements are at the basis of efficient data collection and analysis, both of which are, in turn, necessary for comprehension of shore processes and palaeoenvironments . Both contemporary process monitoring and palaeoenvironmental interpretation rely on the use of rapidly developing modern techniques involving field, laboratory, and modeling techniques. Analysis of contemporary shore processes may stem from the acquisition of direct or indirect data that include hydrodynamic and aerodynamic conditions. It should be noted, however, that while contemporary process studies and modeling approaches form the basis for insight into shore processes, their reliable application to palaeoenvironments depends on adequate preservation of indicators of such environments. ]"

Tidal currents in the central mediterranean sea are investigated. Tidal currents are weak and concentrated in the diurnal–semidiurnal band. Diurnal-period tidal currents are potentially affected by internal tides. , Two years of sea surface current measurements acquired since August 2012 by High-Frequency SeaSonde radars over the relatively shallow shelf area dividing the Maltese Islands from Sicily (the Malta - Sicily Channel), are used to characterize the surface tidal currents in the region. Tidal currents are generally weak and concentrated in the semidiurnal and diurnal bands, barely exceeding 3 cm s −1 in the semidiurnal band (M 2 , S 2 ), and below 6 cm s −1 in the diurnal band (K 1 , O 1 ). In the middle part of the basin, the M 2 currents oscillate along the main Channel axis; on the contrary the S 2 oscillations are oriented along the energetic Atlantic Ionian Stream (AIS) flow. Diurnal tides have a more circular pattern, also following the AIS path and with a significant intensification in proximity of the shelf break, thus suggesting a substantial contribution from internal tides in the region. Phase contours suggest the presence of amphidromic points for both the semidiurnal and diurnal constituents, located in the central area of the Channel for S 2 , O 1 and K 1 , but slightly shifted towards north-west for the M 2 component. ]"

Critical disconnection between management practitioners and researchers. Geopolitical differences between Mesoamerican Reef countries reduces management effectiveness. Practicable recommendations using existing infrastructures to promote conservation. , Mangroves are declining globally at faster rates than tropical forests and coral reefs, with primary threats including, aquaculture , agriculture and climate change. Mangroves provide ecosystem services to coastal communities of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras, which comprise the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) ecoregion. Over the past two decades mangroves within the MAR have declined. Current estimates of mangrove cover in the region suggest that mangroves cover 239,176 ha of the MAR, equivalent to 1.7% of the world's mangroves. Concerted efforts to manage, conserve and protect mangrove forest are apparent in all four countries. Comprehensive laws that prohibit the cutting and clearing of mangroves have been implemented in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. Belize has a permitting system to regulate mangrove alterations. In addition, a total of seven international and regional agreements have been ratified. Across the ecoregion, forty-three protected areas have been designated that contain mangroves, providing protection to 111,396 ha of mangroves (47% of the total). However, our findings suggest a lack of transparency in the governance framework, a disconnect between management and research, and geopolitical differences have all played a role in reducing management efficacy. A key finding of our study reveals a distinct division in the perceived major threats to mangroves between Ramsar site managers and researchers. Ramsar site managers identify anthropogenic disturbances as key threats, while in contrast, the bulk of research focuses on natural disturbances. To promote the inclusion of evidence-based research within mangrove management plans, greater efforts to connect these important stakeholders are required. ]"

Threats to beaches arise from a range of stressors which span a spectrum of impact scales from localised effects (e.g. trampling) to a truly global reach (e.g. sea-level rise). These pressures act at multiple temporal and spatial scales, translating into ecological impacts that are manifested across several dimensions in time and space so that today almost every beach on every coastline is threatened by human activities. Press disturbances (whatever the impact source involved) are becoming increasingly common, operating on time scales of years to decades. However, long-term data sets that describe either the natural dynamics of beach systems or the human impacts on beaches are scarce and fragmentary. A top priority is to implement long-term field experiments and monitoring programmes that quantify the dynamics of key ecological attributes on sandy beaches. Because of the inertia associated with global climate change and human population growth, no realistic management scenario will alleviate these threats in the short term. The immediate priority is to avoid further development of coastal areas likely to be directly impacted by retreating shorelines. There is also scope for improvement in experimental design to better distinguish natural variability from anthropogenic impacts. Sea-level rise and other effects of global warming are expected to intensify other anthropogenic pressures, and could cause unprecedented ecological impacts. The definition of the relevant scales of analysis, which will vary according to the magnitude of the impact and the organisational level under analysis, and the recognition of a physical–biological coupling at different scales, should be included in approaches to quantify impacts. Zoning strategies and marine reserves, which have not been widely implemented in sandy beaches, could be a key tool for biodiversity conservation and should also facilitate spillover effects into adjacent beach habitats. Setback and zoning strategies need to be enforced through legislation, and all relevant stakeholders should be included in the design, implementation and institutionalisation of these initiatives. New perspectives for rational management of sandy beaches require paradigm shifts, by including not only basic ecosystem principles, but also incentives for effective governance and sharing of management roles between government and local stakeholders. ]"

Uncertainty analysis of MSW’s physical components was estimated. Recommendations for MSW’s management were proposed. , Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a heterogeneous waste stream, which is harmful for human health and the ecological environment if it is not well managed. Based on results from different authors by analyzing the generation, physical components and management of MSW from different cities, this paper presents an overview of the temporal trends and spatial variation characterization of MSW generation and its physical components in China. Total MSW generation has increased from 31,320 thousand tons in 1980 to 178,602 thousand tons in 2014, and MSW generation per capita has also increased from 448.3 g to 653.2 g. The distribution of MSW generation is mostly concentrated in the coastal southeastern region, as well as large point sources of more than 200 thousand tons per year are mostly distributed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hebei and Guangdong provinces. The review shows that the largest proportion of food waste, plastics and paper is 61.2% (54.2–65.9%, 95% CI), 9.8% (7.2–14.0%, 95% CI), 9.6% (6.7–12.3%, 95% CI), respectively, in 2014; the best estimates of other waste were as follows: 3.1% textile, 2.1% glass, 1.1% metal, 1.8% wood and grass, 1.3% rubber and leather, 1.8% ceramic, 2.5% ash, 1.2% hazardous waste, and 4.5% miscellaneous. To better manage China’s MSW, several possible and appropriate solutions (e.g., concentrating on key regions, intensifying source separation, promoting green lifestyle, and establishing specialized regulations and policies) should be adopted, which might facilitate the application of China’s 13th Five, and identify gaps in our knowledge of MSW management subject. ]"

We suggest that ‘periglacial’ has little meaning when applied locally and the term ‘relict cold-climate deposits’ is more appropriate. In this paper we examine the origin and age of relict cold-climate slope deposits, fan alluvium and aeolian sediments in Tasmania, and infer the conditions under which they accumulated. Fan alluvium dating from the penultimate Glacial (OIS 6) and capped by a prominent palaeosol deduced to date to the Last Interglacial (OIS 5e) is present at Woodstock, south of Hobart. Many fan deposits formed before 40 ka or in a period c. 30–23 ka; only a few deposits date to the Last Glacial Maximum in Tasmania, which is defined as spanning the period 23.5–17.5 ka. Slope deposits indicate widespread instability down to present-day sea level throughout the Last Glacial, probably as a result of freeze–thaw in a sparsely vegetated landscape. Layered fine gravel and coarse sand colluvial deposits resembling grèzes litées, produced both by dry deposition and by the action of water, are locally common where jointed siltstone bedrock outcrops. These deposits occur from altitudes of 500 m to near sea level and also in caves and must have formed under sparse vegetation cover, probably by freeze–thaw in extremely dry conditions. They have been radiocarbon dated from 35 to 17.5 cal. ka. Relict dunes and sandsheets are widespread at the margin of the Bassian Plain that once provided a land bridge between Tasmania and the mainland. They are also found in western Tasmania and in areas of inland southern Tasmania that now support wet eucalypt forest and rainforest and receive mean annual rainfall &gt; 1500 mm. In the south they have been dated &gt; 87.5–19 ka and attest to a long period of semi-arid climate in an area extending well to the west and south of the present semiarid zone. We deduce that during most of the Last Glacial anticyclones dominated Tasmania's climate and rain-bearing depressions generally passed south of the land mass. However in the east prominent palaeosols in aeolian deposits, dated between 26.4 ka and 16 ka at different locations, and palaeosols with morphology indicating formation under humid conditions, indicate periods of wetter climate in eastern Tasmania during or close to the LGM, deduced to be the result of easterlies associated with near-coastal depressions in the western Tasman Sea. Such easterlies may also be responsible for short Last Glacial wet periods noted at mainland coastal sites. A plot of ages of all dated deposits reveals an increase of erosion and deposition between 35 and 20 ka, and greater prevalence of aeolian deposits in the 35–15 ka period than earlier in the Last Glacial. There are two possible explanations for this pattern: (1) that aeolian activity increased as the result of climatic effects (e.g. increased windiness); or (2) that shrubland biomass increased after the megafauna were hunted to extinction following human arrival c. 40 ka, causing increased fire frequency, and in the cold dry climate of the late Last Glacial such fires caused increased erosion and increased aeolian accumulation. ]"

Ice-flow vectors and facies variations indicate that diamonds and kimberlitic indicator minerals, acquired in this source region during the Dwyka glaciation , were transported to and deposited in areas adjacent to the modern Atlantic coast of southern Africa. Diamonds and kimberlite garnets , recovered from the Koa River gravel deposits on the Bushmanland Plateau, were probably derived by weathering of these Dwyka Group rocks. Along the west coast of South Africa and Namibia, marine and fluvial diamond concentrations of Cretaceous, Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene ages were also partly derived from Dwyka sources in both the Karoo and Kalahari Basins, as well as from other secondary sources such as glacial and fluvial sedimentary rocks of the Gariep Complex, Nama Group and Table Mountain Group. On the coastal plain, Cretaceous fluvial deposits formed during scarp retreat under podzolic weathering conditions. Miocene and younger fluvial and marine deposits formed by weathering processes that involved stripping of back-escarpment Karoo cover. Due to the presence of oversized diamictite-clast trapsites, concentrations of diamonds accumulated on exposed pre-Karoo surfaces during extended periods of crustal stability. Brief episodes of increased precipitation and uplift during the Miocene and Pliocene caused the flushing of these concentrations, in discrete events, via a few major drainages, into marine and near-coastal fluvial and aeolian settings. The majority of inland alluvial diamond deposits are located in a broad belt to the north and west of the Cretaceous diamondiferous kimberlite clusters in central South Africa. This distribution is probably the result of north-westward-flowing fluvial systems, inland of the Great Escarpment, which eroded significant thicknesses (up to 1.5 km) of Karoo cover rocks and drained into the palaeo-Molopo (Kalahari) River across the buried Cargonian Highlands. Lag concentrations of diamonds ultimately formed on the African Surface in traps such as karstic depressions and fluvial channels. Post-African weathering exposed south-westward-draining pre-Karoo glacial valleys along the margins of the Cargonian Highlands and established the Vaal–Harts–upper Orange River system, which reworked the older African-Surface regolith into secondary Miocene and younger colluvial and alluvial gravel deposits. Additional diamond contributions came from limited post-African weathering of primary kimberlite and secondary Dwyka sources. These gravel deposits extend as far as Prieska on the upper Orange River and may not have contributed large quantities of diamonds to the west-coast diamond resource. The inland alluvial deposits, therefore, have a significant primary Cretaceous kimberlite source, whereas those on the west coast were derived from multiple sources that include a substantial primary pre-Karoo kimberlite component via secondary Dwyka Group glacial redistribution. ]"

Volcanic and geothermal activities may trigger dramatic events, such as glacier surges , volcano–glacial jökulhlaups , and tephra deposition on glacier surfaces. Studies of processes related to glacier–volcano interaction and sedimentation in Iceland are highly relevant, because such processes may seriously affect populated areas, the infrastructure, engineering projects and the environment in a wider perspective. Furthermore, investigations of volcanic and glacial sedimentary processes, especially at Icelandic lowland glaciers, have provided depositional models for landscapes in former glaciated areas both in Iceland and elsewhere. Therefore, process–sediment–landform studies at Icelandic glacier margins are highly useful both for reconstructing the impact of volcanic events on the glacial environment and for generating depositional models for glacial sediments . In most reconstructions of glacial and volcanic events in Iceland, establishment of a high-resolution geochronology is realistic, because of tephrochronology , the abundance of organic material for 14 C dating and the emerging field of cosmogenic exposure dating. This makes Iceland an attractive laboratory for geoscientists working with the intimate interplay between volcanism and glacier dynamics . ]"

Proxy sea-level records should therefore also be considered. In this review we compare recent proxy and instrumental sea-level records from the North Atlantic, Australia and New Zealand with the long-term (linear) rate of relative sea-level change that prevailed in the centuries and millennia before the 19th century. We re-evaluate dating models that underpin many of the proxy records and only consider published sea-level index points for which a reliable age can be firmly established. For seven coastal sites we determine the start of recent rapid sea-level rise by identifying the time when sea-level rise first departed from the long-term background rate. We find that within a 40 year period, centred around 1925, sea-level rise in all sites started to exceed the late Holocene background rate. This is consistent with local tide-gauge records and also with global and regional tide-gauge compilations. We conclude that proxy and instrumental sea-level datasets record a similar 20th century inflexion. Possible mismatches identified in published literature are therefore reconciled. We suggest that northern hemisphere ice melt, primarily from the Greenland Ice Sheet and small Arctic glaciers, is the main driving mechanism of early 20th century sea-level rise. ]"

Forecasting the hazards associated with future earthquakes along this &gt; 700 km long fault requires a comprehensive understanding of past fault behaviour. While the region benefits from a long and detailed historical record, palaeoseismology has the potential to provide a longer-term perspective and additional crucial insights. In this paper, we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding geological evidence for past earthquakes and tsunamis along the Nankai-Suruga Trough. Incorporating literature originally published in both Japanese and English and enhancing available results with new age modelling approaches, we summarise and critically evaluate evidence from a wide variety of sources. Palaeoseismic evidence includes uplifted marine terraces and biota, marine and lacustrine turbidites , liquefaction features, subsided marshes and tsunami deposits in coastal lakes and lowlands. While 75 publications describe proposed evidence from &gt; 70 sites, only a limited number provide compelling, well-dated evidence. The best available records enable us to map the most likely rupture zones of twelve earthquakes that occurred during the historical period. This spatiotemporal compilation suggests that the 1707 CE earthquake ruptured almost the full length of the subduction zone and that earthquakes in 1361 CE and 684 CE may have been predecessors of similar magnitude. Intervening earthquakes were of lesser magnitude, highlighting the variability in rupture mode that characterises the Nankai-Suruga Trough. Intervals between ruptures of the same seismic segment range from &lt; 100 to &gt; 450 years during the historical period. Over longer timescales, palaeoseismic evidence suggests intervals between earthquakes ranging from 100 to 700 years, however these figures reflect a range of thresholds controlling the creation and preservation of evidence at any given site as well as the genuine intervals between earthquakes. At present, there is no geological data that suggest the occurrence of a larger magnitude earthquake than that experienced in 1707 CE, however few studies have sought to establish the relative magnitudes of different earthquake and tsunami events along the Nankai-Suruga Trough. Alongside the lack of research designed to quantify the maximum magnitude of past earthquakes, we emphasise issues over alternative hypotheses for proposed palaeoseismic evidence, the paucity of robust chronological frameworks and insufficient appreciation of changing thresholds of evidence creation and preservation over time as key issues that must be addressed by future research. ]"

Limited research on species important to local fisheries and higher order trophic levels. , It is widely accepted that Zostera japonica , a seagrass species native to estuarine and coastal habitats of the Western Pacific Ocean, invaded these same habitats in the Eastern Pacific early in the Twentieth Century. Based on the supposition that this species causes harm to native species living in the estuarine and coastal regions of Washington State, in 2012 they started legally allowing local enforcement to remove Z. japonica . We executed a literature search to determine if reviewed studies support the contention that Z. japonica harms native species and habitats in Washington State and other locations in the Pacific Northwest region of the eastern Pacific Ocean. We found that studies designed to quantitatively assess Z. japonica 's impact are limited but provide a summary that suggests Z. japonica increases overall diversity of infaunal invertebrates, while decreasing large infaunal species, such as Manilla clam and ghost shrimp, and the native seagrass, Zostera marina . Our finding is restricted by a lack of repeated or long-term sampling effort and inadequate treatment of important higher order trophic levels and commercially harvested species in study designs. In this analysis we demonstrate that rigorous scientific investigation is needed before generalized policies, potentially influencing ecosystem productivity, are adopted. ]"

A multi-disciplinary reconnaissance team involving topographic surveyors, tsunami/hydrology modellers, structural engineers, and risk analysts collected observational and quantitative data on building damage and the tsunami demand. A diverse range of collected data, which included a topographic survey, observed water depths, predominant flow directions, inundation limits, building damage, and eyewitness reports, were used to recreate the peak tsunami-induced demands on structures at each of the survey locations. Using the interpreted data, fragility functions were developed for a variety of building classes using logistic regression. It was observed that residential timber structures were more fragile (i.e. have a higher likelihood of damage for a given water depth) than masonry residential structures for severe and collapse damage states. Conversely, residential reinforced concrete structures were observed to be less fragile than residential masonry structures for severe and collapse damage states. The influence of ‘shielding’ and ‘entrained debris’ effects on fragility functions were also quantified using the empirical data. Other parameters such as velocity or impact duration were not considered due to the paucity of data. The results of this study contribute to the ongoing development of robust methods for explicitly estimating tsunami-induced risk to coastal communities. ]"

This research elaborates on the historical evolution of the MFZ in China since the beginning of reform and opening-up policy when the marine spatial planning was firstly highly valued in China. Over time, the MFZ in China has evolved through four stages: the formation of the MFZ prototype (1978–1986), MFZ's official initiation (1987–1997), MFZ's legalization (1998–2003), MFZ's maturity and the optimization period (2004-up to now). The evolution process as well as its characteristics is analyzed and summarized accordingly. The results show that the spatial scope of the MFZ is expanding, the hierarchical system of MFZ is more standardized; the classification system of MFZ is more rationalized; and the objectives of MFZ are gradually quantified. However, problems and challenges, including lagging and inflexible plans, deficiency in public participation, insufficient marine environment protection, and vague zoning ownership, still exist and deserve attention during the evolution of MFZ. At the end, a development tendency analysis of the MFZ is conducted, which reveals that the formulation of MFZ will change from “top down” to “bottom up”; the vertical planning scope of MFZ will extend to deep sea and seabed; the classification of MFZ will transform from functional orientation to constraint orientation. ]"

The tidal hydrodynamics governing the strait results from a semi-diurnal phase inversion between two interlinked wider basins (i.e., the Tyrrhenian Sea to the north and the Ionian Sea to the south), due to the presence of a nodal tidal point in the centre of the strait. This condition, associated with coastal narrowing, causes continuous water exchanges and a local phenomenon of tidal amplification, producing collinear tidal currents up to 3 m s −1 in velocity in the point of tidal maxima of the strait centre. Currents follow bi-directional patterns across the strait, decelerating towards either opposite peripheries because of the progressive enlargement of the cross-sectional areas. Tides exert a relevant influence on the strait bottom, shaping characteristic erosional features, governing the main sediment transport routes and promoting the migration of distinctive bedforms . The textural and dimensional attributes of these bottom features vary according to the current velocity trends and main directions, indicating a specific partition of the strait in individual sedimentary zones. In the Early Pleistocene, analogous conditions established across the same area, and huge quantities of siliciclastic and bioclastic deposits accumulated in the ancient Messina Strait under a similar tidal hydrodynamics. The 250-m-thick strait-fill succession, which is magnificently exposed across the two opposite margins (i.e., Scylla and Charybdis) of the modern passageway , represents a crucial correlative element in supporting the reconstruction of the sedimentary dynamics of the past strait, based on the observation of the modern system. In this work, which represents the second part of a first article focused on the modern Messina Strait, previous stratigraphic data are reviewed and integrated with new sedimentological observations carried out in both onshore and offshore key areas. In particular, outcrop analysis allows distinguishing a number of facies associations, which are described and interpreted by taking into account the correspondent modern depositional strait setting. The results of this study highlight a mutual correlation between the depositional zones detected in the modern Messina Strait and the individual facies associations recognised in the onshore margins. The strait-centre zone represented a bedload parting sector in the ancient system. This zone, which is one of the most difficult environment to detect in ancient straits due to a condensed sedimentary record, is suggested to coincide with a structural palaeo-high, exposed in the southern sector of the investigated onshore area and continuing offshore in the modern strait. This tectonic horst symmetrically separated two opposite highly-depositional zones to the north and to the south, hosting gravel and sand-size siliciclastic and bioclastic deposits, exhibiting diffuse motifs of large-scale tidal cross stratification and a specific vertical facies stacking. These characteristic tidal deposits, which are believed to record the migration of several generations of tidal dunes forming extensive bedform fields in the strait, reflect a tidal asymmetry between flood and ebb currents. Tidal asymmetry is referable to the oceanographic setting observable nowadays in the Messina Strait and deriving from a marked density-driven, water-mass stratification between the two opposite flows. In the ancient system, tidal dunes transited down-current to highly bioturbated fines, including sporadic small-scale tidal cross strata, representing the distal periphery of the Early Pleistocene strait. Here, bedforms followed migration pathways not always reflecting mutually-evasive net-gross sediment transport routes, due to local conditions of current rotation occurring during each tidal phase inversion. During these stages, similar to slack-water periods, currents were weak enough to allow fine sediments to be settled from suspension, reproducing a signature typical of other tide-dominated coastal systems (e.g., estuaries , tidal flats , etc.). These sedimentary zones of the ancient Messina Strait were laterally bounded by tectonically-active margins, where fan deltas, clastic aprons and carbonate wedges developed under the constant interplay between mass-transport processes and tidal currents . The resulting architectural and sedimentary features observable in outcrop reveal impressive similarities with the morpho-bathymetric features nowadays documented in the correspondent strait-margin modern environments. These considerations allow deciphering a general palaeo-environmental reconstruction of the ancient strait which, although suffering of limitations due to a partial preservation of the whole rock record, discloses sedimentary processes and depositional environments of the ancient Messina Strait. The process-based analysis of this field-based case study is crucial in predicting long-term environmental changes and facies migration pathways and improves the state of knowledge on tidal straits, which are the less understood among the most common tidal depositional systems. ]"

The Po Plain–Adriatic Sea system, where a wealth of research has been conducted during the last 20 years, represents one of the most intensively investigated late Quaternary successions. With the aid of a chronologically well-constrained stratigraphy, paleoenvironmental evolution is tracked for the first time from fluvial to deep-marine realms, over 1000 km in length. Vertical stacking trends (onshore) and stratal terminations (offshore) are the key observations that allow identification of surfaces with sequence-stratigraphic significance (systems tract boundaries) in the distinct segments of the system. Recurring motifs in stratigraphic architecture, showing tight coupling of sedimentary responses among source area, catchment basin, and coastal and marine depocenters , reveal a cyclicity driven by glacio-eustatic fluctuations in the Milankovitch band. Due to high rates of subsidence , middle Pleistocene forced regressive systems tracts are exceptionally expanded, and the MIS5e–MIS2 interval (Late Pleistocene) preserves a nearly continuous record of fourth-order (100 kyr) stepwise sea-level fall. The stratigraphic architecture of Last Glacial Maximum deposits highlights the genetic relations between channel–belt development, pedogenesis , and sediment delivery to the lowstand delta, through narrow incised-valley conduits. The Late glacial-Holocene succession records the last episode of sea-level rise and stabilization through well-developed patterns of shoreline transgression/regression (TST/HST) that can be readily traced updip, from offshore to onshore locations. Architectural styles across the whole system reflect a dominance of allogenic forcing in the TST, as opposed to a predominantly autogenic control on stratigraphic development in the HST . External drivers of facies architecture were also effective on millennial timescales: the Younger Dryas cold reversal, which marks the transgressive surface on land, records a short-lived episode of subaqueous progradation that is correlative onshore with widespread, immature paleosol development and small-sized channel–belt formation. Quantitative assessment of sediment budgets over different time intervals requires precise positioning of the key bounding surfaces. Based on this approach, we outline for the first time over the entire Po–Adriatic Basin an estimate of the sediment volumes stored in each systems tract. ]"

In this setting, long-term surficial CO 2 sequestration occurs through the combination of biomineralisation , organomineralisation and lithification , which locks atmospheric CO 2 into CaCO 3 rocks and sediments. Biogeomorphological processes that control the distribution and effectiveness of these mechanisms including biostabilisation, bioconstruction, bioerosion and bioturbation have not been addressed in this setting to date. A three-dimensional biogemorphological mapping unit framework is defined at three locations in Hamelin Pool within the shallow-subtidal to supratidal zones based on historical and recent multiscale datasets. This framework is used to review the complex distribution of geomorphological and biogeomorphological processes. The distribution of lithification within a biogeomorphological process context is examined, and current geological analogue models of microbialite and coquina development are expanded to include biogeomorphological processes. The framework is used to understand the impacts of increased water elevation in response to intensification of the Leeuwin Current during the 2010–2012 Ningaloo Niño event. Potential climate change impacts are identified including reduced intertidal bioconstruction, and a shift from microbialitic structure generation to increased grain generation reducing stromatolite development.

The pinnacles have formed in the Pleistocene Tamala Limestone, which comprises cyclic sequences of aeolian calcarenite , calcrete/microbialite and palaeosol . The morphology of the pinnacles varies according to the lithology in which they have formed: typically conical in aeolianite and cylindrical in microbialite . Detailed mapping and mineralogical, chemical and isotopic analyses were used to constrain the origin of the pinnacles, which are residual features resulting mainly from solutional widening and coalescence of solution pipes within the Tamala Limestone. The pinnacles are generally joined at the base, and the stratigraphy exposed in their sides is often continuous between adjacent pinnacles. Some pinnacles are cemented infills of solution pipes, but solution still contributed to their origin by removing the surrounding material. Although a number of pinnacles contain calcified plant roots, trees were not a major factor in their formation. Pinnacle karst in older, better-cemented limestones elsewhere in the world is similar in morphology and origin to the Nambung pinnacles, but is mainly influenced by joints and fractures (not evident at Nambung). The extensive dissolution associated with pinnacle formation at Nambung resulted in a large amount of insoluble quartz residue, which was redeposited to often bury the pinnacles. This period of karstification occurred at around MIS 5e, and there was an earlier, less intense period of pinnacle development during MIS 10–11. Both periods of pinnacle formation probably occurred during the higher rainfall periods that characterise the transition from interglacial to glacial episodes in southern Australia; the extensive karstification around MIS 5e indicates that the climate was particularly humid in southwestern Australia at this time. ]"

This study used a large-scale perspective and proposed two new indices: one based on the sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic, and the other on coastal wind stress. The proposed indices were not only consistent with empirical evidence but were also based on current understanding of the processes underlying environmental variability and pelagic fish recruitment dynamics. Prior to the mid-1980s, sardine recruitment strength was positively correlated with SST and negatively with wind. Subsequently, these relationships reversed, recruitment being negatively correlated with SST and positively correlated with wind. GAM models incorporating recruitment, spawning stock biomass and environmental indices were built and compared, and two hypotheses were formulated to explain the reversal of the environment–fish relationships. The first addressed a switch between two environmental regimes: the first (prior to the mid-1980s) characterised by weak stratification and strong enrichment, and the second (late 1980s and the 1990s) characterised by frequent warm events, stronger stratification, and reduced enrichment and productivity. The second hypothesis suggested that the reversal can be attributed to changed population structure, distribution and migration behaviour of the severely overfished sardine stock resulting in a shift from the optimal spawning area in the vicinity of Walvis Bay to the a less favourable spawning habitat in the north. The present depressed state of the stock does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn about the effect of the environment on its population dynamics, nor to consider the implications for management. However, it is argued that an appreciation of how such relationships may change through time is important in further understanding and modelling oceanic and fisheries systems in the region. ]"

Offshore of the two main river basins of the Douro and Minho, two fine-grained sedimentary formations can be characterised. A geochemical study of this sediment cover has been performed focussing in particular on the fine deposits and the adjacent estuaries. The chemical composition of superficial sediments collected from the northern Portuguese shelf and from the river basins of the Minho and Douro rivers was determined for major, minor and trace elements; the rare earth elements (REE) composition was also determined in selected samples. Statistical analyses of these data for the shelf sediments allow us to identify elements with similar behaviours and the different sediment types along the shelf, and to evaluate of their origins. Downcore profiles of the chemical composition of the fine sediments reveal no evidence for changes induced by recent human activities. To assess the influence of the rivers on the fine sedimentary formations, the elemental distribution patterns of selected sediments have been compared with the estuarine sediments. Lithogenic elements composition normalised to Al and the shale normalised REE distributions showed there are similarities between the Douro River sediments and the sediment composition of the Douro and Galicia mud patches. However, the Galicia mud field showed no relationship in its chemical composition to sediments derived from the Minho River. Nor was any evidence for heavy metal contamination originating from the Douro estuary detected in anthropogenic element/Al ratios in the shelf sediments. This may be because of processes associated with resuspension, complexation and bioturbation that occur during sediment transport and deposition. Nevertheless, the Douro River seems to be the main continental source of fine sediments being deposited on the northern Portuguese shelf. ]"

This paper reviews the surveys and researches of microplastics in the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, the South China Sea, and main estuaries in China carried out in recent years and proposes an outlook for future work, aiming to provide research suggestions and solutions for ecological protection against microplastic pollution in sea areas in China. Previous studies have shown that microplastics are widely distributed in water bodies and sediments in sea areas and major estuaries in China. The Pearl River Estuary, in the South China Sea suffers the most serious microplastic pollution, followed by the Bohai Sea. In contrast, the microplastic pollution in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea is comparatively slight. Microplastics in sea areas in China are mainly fibrous and are concentrated in offshore areas with developed industry and a dense population (especially around estuaries and bays).

Furthermore, these investigations can address critical geological and palaeoecological questions surrounding longer-term coral-sediment interactions and reef growth histories. Here we review current knowledge about turbid zone reefs from the inner-shelf regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia to consider these issues and to evaluate reef growth in the period prior to and post European settlement. We also consider the future prospects of these reefs under reported changing water quality regimes. Turbid zone reefs on the GBR are relatively well known compared to those in other reef regions. They occur within 20 km of the mainland coast where reef development may be influenced by continual or episodic terrigenous sediment inputs, fluctuating salinities (24–36 ppt), and reduced water quality through increased nutrient and pollutant delivery from urban and agricultural runoff . Individually, and in synergy, these environmental conditions are widely viewed as unfavourable for sustained and vigorous coral reef growth, and thus these reefs are widely perceived as marginal compared to clear water reef systems. However, recent research has revealed that this view is misleading, and that in fact many turbid zone reefs in this region are resilient, exhibit relatively high live coral cover (&gt; 30%) and have distinctive community assemblages dominated by fast growing ( Acropora , Montipora ) and/or sediment tolerant species ( Turbinaria , Goniopora , Galaxea , Porites ). Palaeoecological reconstructions based on the analysis of reef cores show that community assemblages are relatively stable at millennial timescales, and that many reefs are actively accreting (average 2–7 mm/year) where accommodation space is available, despite recent anthropogenic pressures. These turbid zone reefs challenge traditional views on the environmental conditions required for active reef growth, but given their proximity to land and associated stresses, current knowledge on these less well understood reefs should be synthesised to aid coastal management directives. Terrigenous sediments are a dominant influence on turbid zone reef occurrence, composition and growth, and, therefore, the assessment of their future prospects will require a detailed understanding of the sedimentary regimes under which they occur and of their differential response modes. ]"

In addition to this density contrast in the supply of muddy or fine-grained sediment to the shore, the convergence of fluvial and marine bedload in estuarine and deltaic settings is an important mechanism in the supply of sand, and sometimes gravel, to the shore. The longshore redistribution of fluvial-supplied bedload from deltaic river mouths is, however, overwhelmingly dominated by wave-induced currents within the inner shoreface, while that of mud is linked to currents induced by waves, tides, wind activity, and density circulations. The amount of sediment supplied annually by the world's rivers has been estimated at 10–20 billion metric tons, although there is considerable uncertainty concerning volumes because of the effects of human intervention. A second important source of bedload sediment supply to the shore is the shoreface, especially in wave-dominated settings. Shoreline translation over the shelf during sea-level fluctuations provides a lower-order framework for further cross-shelf reworking of sediments, and this is a prime consideration in palaeoenvironmental applications of shore processes. This chapter deals with processes involved in supplying sediment to the shore. The first part examines the supply and convergence of sediment in transit through the fluvio-marine domain, while the second looks at sediment supply from the shoreface. ]"

Some scholars argue that resilience and vulnerability are isolated concepts due to their epistemological origin, while others note the existence of a strong resilience-vulnerability relationship. In summary, there is academic debate about 1) resilience as an antonym of vulnerability, 2) resilience as a factor of vulnerability, and 3) resilience as related to but different from vulnerability. Here, we present an analytical framework based on the dynamic resilience-vulnerability interaction throughout the adaptive cycle of complex systems and disaster process phases. To this end, the evolution of resilience and vulnerability concepts is briefly reviewed. This review shows that resilience can be measured as an outcome in terms of recovery or as attributes composed of absorptive, adaptive, and transformative capacities. Resilience attributes influence vulnerability before, during, and after the disaster, whereas vulnerability influences resilience only after the disturbance when it is measured as an outcome. Our proposal exposes households as SESs whose capital assets are elements that contribute resilience attributes to the system, such as diversity, connectivity, and thresholds, that together constitute the absorptive capacity. We conclude that more than a linear or straightforward relationship, resilience and vulnerability have a dynamic interaction that changes along with the adaptive cycle of SESs and the phases of disasters. ]"

The succession of pelagic fisheries, anchovy ( Engraulis ringens ) and sardine ( Sardinops sagax ), occurring in this fishing zone was analyzed taking into account the landings, the CPUE abundance index, the fishing effort, and the environmental variables. The anchovy production model is a negative linear function of fishing effort and turbulence. For sardine, the production model is a negative linear function of fishing effort and a quadratic function of the sea surface temperature. An analysis of the relationship between recruitment, adult biomass and the environment shows that the annual recruitment of anchovy increases with turbulence intensity until wind speed reaches a value of 5.46 m s −1 , decreasing for higher values. For sardine, the recruitment increases with turbulence intensity until 5.63 m s −1 , stabilizing thereafter. It is deduced that the climatic variations associated to the El Niño events affect the abundance of coastal pelagic fishes, without forgetting the most likely effects upon its distribution and the fishing effort. However, it is the long-term variability that mainly affects the fishing activity. ]"

Non-uniform slip extended ~ 220 km across the width and ~ 400 km along strike of the subduction zone . Extensive data provided by regional networks of seismic and geodetic stations in Japan and global networks of broadband seismic stations, regional and global ocean bottom pressure sensors and sea level measurement stations, seafloor GPS/Acoustic displacement sites, repeated multi-channel reflection images, extensive coastal runup and inundation observations, and in situ sampling of the shallow fault zone materials and temperature perturbation, make the event the best-recorded and most extensively studied great earthquake to date. An effort is made here to identify the more robust attributes of the rupture as well as less well constrained, but likely features. Other issues involve the degree to which the rupture corresponded to geodetically-defined preceding slip-deficit regions, the influence of re-rupture of slip regions for large events in the past few centuries, and relationships of coseismic slip to precursory slow slip, foreshocks , aftershocks , afterslip, and relocking of the megathrust. Frictional properties associated with the slip heterogeneity and in situ measurements of frictional heating of the shallow fault zone support low stress during shallow sliding and near-total shear stress drop of ~ 10–30 MPa in large-slip regions in the shallow megathrust. The roles of fault morphology, sediments, fluids, and dynamical processes in the rupture behavior continue to be examined; consensus has not yet been achieved. The possibility of secondary sources of tsunami excitation such as inelastic deformation of the sedimentary wedge or submarine slumping remains undemonstrated; dislocation models in an elastic continuum appear to sufficiently account for most mainshock observations, although afterslip and viscoelastic processes remain contested. ]"

Mid-crustal transpression at amphibolite to granulite facies conditions is dominated by two major, &gt; 400 km exposed, strike-slip shear zones bounding a 20–40 km wide high-grade Orogen Core. To the east, a deeply buried nappe-dominated Escape Zone has inverted metamorphic sequence and verges outwards onto a platformal foreland. To the west, an arc-like Neoproterozoic Coastal Terrane was amalgamated and variably reworked during transpression. The major Purros and Three Palms Mylonite Zones have calculated shear displacements on the order of 120–180 km. These shear zones are moderately to steeply dipping mylonite zones of 1–5 km width, are arcuate and curvilinear in map view and show along-strike variation in slip kinematics. Also highly curved in vertical section, the shear zones define a flower to half-flower geometry for the Orogen Core. An oblique network of mylonitic shear zones, akin to Riedel shears, links the major shear zones and defines regional-scale shear lozenges internally deformed by tight upright folding and shear fabrics. These shear zones create domains in the Orogen Core with varying dominance of pure shear (in shear lozenges) and simple shear (in shear zones). However, absence of dip-slip domains and the smoothly continuous traces of sub-horizontal to shallow and acute, oblique stretching lineations across all parts of the belt, preclude marked kinematic partitioning and the internal part of the belt resembles large-scale triclinic shear. Clast aspect ratios, boudin train extension, sheath fold aspect geometry, degree of rotation of planes producing flanking folds, composite S–C foliations, pressure fringes on pyrite and garnet porphyroclasts provide a semi-quantitative measure of strain intensity. Average strain ratios are X/Z &gt; 40:1 for the major shear zones, X/Z &gt; 12:1 for the Orogen Core, X/Z &gt; 8:1 for the Escape Zone and X/Z &gt; 3:1 for the Coastal Terrane. A more continuous pattern of strain intensity across the whole belt is mapped using a qualitative foliation intensity index. Foliation traces have a sigmoidal pattern in the Orogen Core, swinging from sub-parallel to the boundary shear zones to higher acute angles in the internal parts. Deformation character also varies from upright open folding in amphibolite facies domains in the north, upright tight chevron folding in a low-grade central domain, to a high-grade domain of tight to isoclinal inter-folded basement and cover, with inclination decreasing towards the south. The Kaoko Belt is a well-exposed sector of an extensive (3000 km long), broad (400 km) arcuate orogenic system “Adamastor Orogen” that amalgamated West Gondwana, bringing the South American (Sao Francisco and Rio de la Plata Cratons) and African (Kalahari and Congo Cratons) components together. Though a complex system, most sectors involved oblique collision and accretion of magmatic arcs of 660–610 Ma age, followed by peak metamorphism and main phase transpressional orogenesis between 585 and 560 Ma, with shear zones remaining active until ∼ 530 Ma. This E–W amalgamation immediately pre-dates the final N–S amalgamation of Gondwana along the Kuunga Orogen between 535 and 510 Ma. The large-scale Adamastor Orogen, consisting of Kaoko, Dom Feliciano, Ribeira, Araçuai and West-Congo mobile belts, also shows broadly similar and symmetric structural architecture throughout. The high-grade thermally softened core partitioned intense wrench dominated strains and networks of transcurrent shear zones that dip inwards with listric form. Either side of the internal zone containing amalgamated arcs and high-grade core, are nappe-fold and thrust belts that rework attenuated passive margin basement and Adamastor Ocean sediments and structures verge outward at moderate to high-angles onto both foreland margins. The Kaoko Belt well illustrates the highly partitioned nature of transpressional systems in general and patterns in common throughout the greater “Adamastor Orogen”; such as metamorphic zonation and heterogeneous distribution of deformation style, flow regime and highly variable degrees of reworking strain and recrystallization. This highly partitioned and steep structural grain localized lithospheric extension and rifting 415 Ma later during breakup and dispersal of Gondwana. ]"

Most of the signal occurs along the boundaries of the basin from Panama to the Alaska Peninsula. Changes in the SSH and alongshore transports along the boundaries are caused both by propagation of signals from the south (stronger between the equator and the Gulf of California) and by local and basin-scale winds (stronger between the Pacific Northwest and the Alaska Peninsula). Two periods of high SSH occur at the equator, May–July 1997 and October 1997–January 1998. The first coastal SSH signal moved quickly polewards to approximately 24°N in early June, then stalled and moved farther north during transient events in July–September. Large-scale wind forcing combined with the equatorial signals during the second period of high equatorial SSH (Fall 1997) to move the high SSH and poleward transports quickly around the Alaska Gyre. A connection between the boundary currents and the interior North Pacific developed as part of the large-scale response to the basin-scale winds, after changes in the boundaries. Decreases in anomalies of SSH and poleward transports began in January 1998 south of 40°N and in February 1998 farther north. ]"

The net result is the formation of stable, micron-sized, oil droplets that disperse into the water column. In turn, the increase in surface area makes the oil more available for biodegradation. This interaction, referred to as oil–mineral aggregate (OMA) formation, can explain how oiled shorelines are cleaned naturally in the absence of wave action in very sheltered coastal environments. OMA formation also plays an important role in the efficacy of shoreline treatment techniques, such as physical mixing and sediment relocation that move oiled sediments into the zone of wave action to promote the interaction between oil and mineral fines. Successful application of these shoreline treatment options has been demonstrated at two spill events (the Tampa Bay response in Florida and the Sea Empress operation in Wales) and at a controlled oil spill experiment in the field (the 1997 Svalbard ITOSS program). Sediment relocation harnesses the hydraulic action of waves so that the processes of fine-particle interaction and physical abrasion usually occur in tandem on open coasts. There has been no evidence of significant detrimental side-effects of residual oil in pelagic or benthic environments associated with the use of these treatment options to enhance rates of dispersion and oil biodegradation. ]"

Based on this, analysis and interpretation were carried out to compute the Ekman mass transport using satellite-derived wind stress curl and wind speed. Our results showed the upwelling, high nutrient fluxes, and chlorophyll-a bloom was observed in station 13 (8.426 μ μ M) and station 12 (7.196 μ μ M) with favorable sea surface temperature and wind condition. Our results revealed that the upwelling within these offshore stations 13 and 12 is much greater than in the surrounding regions. The phytoplankton density maxima were around 1874 cell L −1 and 1864 cell L −1 in stations 13 and 12 respectively. Totally 100 species of phytoplankton identified in the present study belonging to three different classes, 68 species of diatoms (Bacillariophyceae), 24 species of dinoflagellates (Dinophyceae), and 8 species of blue–green (Cyanophyceae). Throughout the cruise, the occurrence of the most dominant species was observed from class Bacillariophyceae. The phytoplankton diversity index, species richness, and evenness ranged from 2.13 to 3.79, 1.24 to 6.56, and 0.63 to 0.97 respectively. The observed highest value of chlorophyll- a and nutrients in station 13 was due to the high species composition observed during the cruise. The datasets were analyzed with a statistical approach using Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to find out the relationship between phytoplankton and physico-chemical parameters. The CCA results inferred that SST, salinity , nutrients have a higher influence on phytoplankton abundance. The correlation revealed chemical parameters such as nitrite, nitrate, silicate, IP, DO and ammonia showed significant positive correlations with biological productivity of chlorophyll- a concentrations and negative correlations with salinity and sea surface temperature along with Ekman mass transport. ]"

The northward trajectory of the Indian plate through the tropics leading to its collision with the Asian plate and the emergence of the Himalayan ranges are known to have resulted in significant climate changes through the Cenozoic. The DVP terrain preserves an imperfect, patchy record of these events and their impact on Cenozoic landscape evolution within an emergent continental block. The subhorizontal disposition of the stacks of lava flows in the DVP was interpreted to manifest the post-eruptive tectonic stability of this terrain. Earlier interpretations of the geomorphic characters of this terrain, with its step-like slope-profiles were consequently attributed to dominant climatic control. We review the regional topographic framework with additional inputs from the structural framework of the Deccan flood basalts , characters of the major rivers draining the province largely based on their high scale longitudinal profiles and Quaternary hinterland sedimentary basins within the DVP. It is evident that the erstwhile interpretation of the DVP as a singular morphotectonic unit where the antecedent drainage responded to Cenozoic tropical climate change with subsidiary tectonic controls requires re-examination. The component blocks of the DVP have differing morphotectonic characters because of the subtle diversity in their relative uplift / sag trajectories and structural characters. The influence of the monsoon climate (with alternating stronger and weaker phases) on landscape evolution in the subprovinces of the DVP is likely to be less significant than was earlier believed. The Deccan landscape reflects the Cenozoic reactivation of ancient tectonic zones that bound the constituent blocks of the province. Its landscape is carved by an antecedent tropical drainage, that was modified by Paleogene and Neogene intracontinental block movements driven by far-field stresses derived from the ridge-push of the Indian Ocean in the south and slab-pull of the subducting Indian Plate in the north. The Deccan landscape provides an example of how lithological and climatic controls on drainage evolution are overprinted by weak midcontinental tectonics. ]"

Phosphorus recovery can promote a blue economy. Bio-based approaches are promising. Environmental, economic, and social challenges should be considered. , Global phosphorus reserves are under pressure of depletion in the near future due to increased consumption of primary phosphorus reservoirs and improper management of phosphorus. At the same time, a considerable portion of global marine water bodies has been suffering from eutrophication due to excessive nutrient loading. The marine environment can be considered as a valuable phosphorus source due to nutrient rich eutrophic seawater and sediment which could potentially serve as phosphorus mines in the near future. Hence, sustainable phosphorus recovery strategies should be adapted for marine systems to provide phosphorus for the growing market demand and simultaneously control eutrophication. In this review, possible sustainable strategies for phosphorus removal and recovery from marine environments are discussed in detail. Bio-based strategies relying on natural phosphorus uptake/release metabolism of living organisms are suggested as promising options that can provide both phosphorus removal and recovery from marine waters for achieving a sustainable marine ecosystem. Among them, the utilization of microorganisms seems promising to develop novel strategies. However, the research gap for the technical applicability of these strategies is still considerably big. Therefore, future research should focus on the technical development of the strategies through laboratory and/or field studies. Coupling phosphorus mining with other valorisation pathways (i.e., metal recovery, energy production) is also suggested to improve overall sustainability and economic viability . Environmental, economic and societal challenges should altogether be well addressed prior to real scale applications. ]"

We evaluate them using multiple criteria (cost, effectiveness, indirect effects). There is a beneficial impact of taxes in terms of reduced plastic bag use. Deposit-refund schemes can achieve high return rates for bottles. The effectiveness of economic instruments depends on response to price signals. , This paper provides a comprehensive up-to-date review of the literature on the economic instruments that can reduce marine litter. We assess their cost of implementation, level of effectiveness as well as indirect environmental and socio-economic effects (externalities) that may arise as a result of their implementation. The evidence points to an overall beneficial impact of environmental taxes on items such as plastic bags in terms of reduced use, as well as a corresponding low cost of implementation. In the same vein, deposit-refund schemes can achieve high return rates for bottles although at a relatively high cost (especially when the scheme targets a wide range of packaging types). In the case of municipal waste collection , a ‘pay-as-you-throw’ charge can be applied to incentivise waste reduction. In coastal areas, waste collection and treatment can be further supported by the collection of tourist taxes, although there is a high risk that these funds might be used for other purposes. In the fishing industry, rewards for fishing vessels that return waste to shore has been shown to both reduce marine litter as well as complement fishermen's income. Since the vast majority of marine litter comes from land-based sources and consists of plastic, economic instruments that target relevant sources of land-based litter more broadly stand to make the greatest contribution to marine litter reduction. The choice of an appropriate intervention is case specific, largely depending on the tackled source of pollution, the country's institutional characteristics and infrastructure, consumer preferences and habitual behaviour, and the economy's overall sectoral composition. ]"
719,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825216301568,"[ Kaolin: Soil, rock and ore ]","[ The kaolinite-group minerals kaolinite , dickite , nacrite, halloysite including its metaform and their associates allophane and imogolite are phyllosilicates characterized by a rather simple chemical composition of Si, Al, O, and H. These elements contribute for the most part to the built-up of the continental earth crust , which down to a depth of approx. 1.5 km, consists of 75% of sedimentary rocks. In a sense, kaolinite-group minerals accommodating these elements in their structure chemically reflect the uppermost part of the crust. It is not a surprise that kaolin is very widespread particularly in those sedimentary rocks which came into existence under near-ambient conditions and, as a further consequence, is a mirror image of those processes taking place in the topmost parts of the crust. In a tripartite subdivision (primary: magmatic/structure bound, secondary: sedimentary, tertiary: metamorphic), the following environments bearing kaolin exist: Primary environments of kaolinization: (1) Vein-type deposits, (2) (sub) volcanic and pyroclastic deposits , (3) skarn to epithermal deposits , (4) granitic rocks and their affiliated rocks (pegmatites and greisen). Secondary environments of kaolinization:(1) kaolin and soil (ferralsols, plinthosols, nitisols, podzols , vertisols , andosols), (2) layered residual kaolin deposits (mixed-type residual kaolin-bauxite deposits, exposed residual kaolin, hidden residual kaolin), (3) vein-like kaolin, (4) alluvial-fluvial environments (alluvial fans, fluvial braided streams, fluvial meandering streams),(5) prograding fluvial deltas (prograding into a playa (dry delta), prograding into a marine or lacustrine basin (wet delta)),(6) lakes and ponds (permanent and ephemeral lakes), (7) coal-bearing environments (suspended load deposits in coal swamps, underclays, composite residual and hydrothermal kaolinization in coal swamps, kaolin tonsteins), (8) marine terrigenous shoreline deposits (open - tide-dominated estuary , blind - wave-dominated estuary , sealed-off lagoon). Tertiary environments of kaolinization: (1) burial diagenesis , (2) very-low grade regional dynamo metamorphism , (3) contact metamorphism . The above tripartite subdivision of kaolin has been established so as to be in accordance with other lithologies which formed through magmatic, sedimentary, and metamorphic processes and to link the present classification scheme directly with the “Chessboard classification scheme of mineral deposits” (Dill, 2010b). While in many classification schemes of mineral deposits kaolin and its minerals were only considered as an “ore” in the category non-metallic deposits and industrial minerals , in the current review the barriers between economic geology and its neighboring disciplines like sedimentology , pedology, geomorphology, petrography and palaeoclimatology have been torn down and the kaolin looked at from different angles, as soil, rock and ore. Kaolin and kaolinitic clays are taken as the type-lithology of the near-surface continental environments. Together with bentonites , bentonitic clays and a varied spectrum of argillites they form part of a group of lithologies , encompassing besides bauxite , ferrites (ferricretes) and laterite , all of which developed close to the interface between atmosphere, pedosphere , hydrosphere , and lithosphere. To accentuate the intimate relation between the various lithologies mentioned in the previous paragraph, a classification scheme has been designed. It makes use in part of pre-existing ternary plots to take also account of these interferences with the different geoscientific disciplines such as sedimentology or pedology. In addition to that, an overview of the various field and laboratory methods to identify and quantify kaolin/kaolinite-group minerals is given. The succeeding parameters, features and settings are crucial as to the kaolinization in the magmatic, sedimentary and metamorphic environments. Geodynamic setting The sites most favorable to develop large (economic) kaolin deposits are located along the passive continental margin and in epicontinental basins. Almost all of the kaolin deposits have to be attributed to the secondary deposits. Rate of uplift and weathering Cratonic crustal sections stable over a long period of time with little vertical displacement are crustal sections favorable for kaolin formation and preservation. During slow uplift, chemical weathering operative in the peneplained hinterland and on the sedimentary bodies in the foreland helped to decompose labile constituents from the parent material and enhance the quality and increase the thickness of the kaolin. Reducing the slope angle or the paleogradient, i.e., moving from the alluvial-colluvial fan system towards deltaic and swampy environments raises the likelihood of kaolin concentration of economic grade. The drainage pattern and hydrography The fluvial drainages system most proximal to the residual kaolin and most favorable for kaolin is the braided-stream drainage system. In the meandering-river system two different types “bar sand kaolin” and the “overbank kaolin deposits” occur. Kaolin accumulation may be tracked down to the coastal marine deposits under humid climatic conditions. Rivers are accountable for a steady supply of suspended load, the tidal processes is held most effective in concentrating the fine-grained raw material and wave action in combination with the transgression and regression of strandlines act as a seal and preserve the kaolin deposit. The tidal analogues developing under arid climatic conditions, also known as coastal sabkha , are of no relevance for kaolin concentration. The most well-balanced state between concentration and preservation of kaolin is achieved in the blind estuary under a mesotidal regime. Organic matter and the redox regime The organic matter has no effect on the formation of kaolin in the primary deposits. In the secondary kaolin deposits the mediating effect increases from the residual kaolin deposits towards the coastal marine deposits. It shows “local positive anomalies” in “wet systems”. Near the basin edge and the hinterland kaolin forms in the upper oxidized vadose zone and more basinward be it lacustrine or marine it prefers the lower reduced part, also called the phreatic zone, of the hydrosphere . Organic matter in metamorphosed black shales has not only a “buffering” effect on the kinematic processes but also a preserving or stimulating effect on kaolinite to form as long as the critical temperature between low- and very-low grade stage metamorphism is not crossed. The variation in the redox conditions is well represented by the valence state of iron in its minerals, e.g., siderite vs. goethite and by the REE . Among the chemical methods, REE anomalies (cerium) can assist in constraining the redox conditions . Temperature and pressure control Only in magmatic kaolin deposits a correlation between the type of kaolinite-group minerals and the temperature is evident. The temperature of formation has been demonstrated to have an influence on the crystallinity of kaolinite and as a “rule of thumbs” the following succession can be given provided a T-controlled kaolinization can be confirmed: Allophane + imogolite ⇒ halloysite ⇒ kaolinite ⇒ dickite ⇒ nacrite. Frequently only part of the sequence is realized in nature. To distinguish hypogene from supergene kaolin, O and H isotopes have proved to be a successful tool, in that these isotopes assist to constrain the temperature of kaolinization. In the course of deep-burial diagenesis, kaolinite is not indicative of a mineralogical depth-response reaction but rather a marker for breaks or hiatuses during basin subsidence . As the intraformational solutions got spoiled by the immigration of fluids from whatever per ascensum and per descensum processes the resultant disequilibrium within the reservoir rocks has to be offset in case of a drop in pH by the formation of kaolinite-group minerals. Lithostatic pressure has been demonstrated to have no effect on kaolinization. Shearing stress is detrimental to the formation and preservation of kaolinite-group minerals. Structure bound kaolin has always been found to be post-kinematic and no shear zone has been mapped where kaolin is pre- or synkinematic. The presence of kaolinite in zones of structural disturbances or elevated stress and strain is due to infiltrations of meteoric and low-salinity waters. Chemical composition of fluids The chemical composition, as far as the content of alkaline earth, alkaline elements and the pH value are concerned, plays a significant role in the course of kaolinization. These fluids are accountable for the transformation parent rock ⇒ kaolin ⇔ bauxite/ferricretes/laterites (with the option of resilicification) and in pedological terms for the “cold kaolin” (humid mid-latitude climatic zone) and “warm kaolin” (humid tropical climatic zone). Ferralsols, plinthosols, nitisols, podzols (also present under these tropical climatic regime), andosols and vertisol are typical of the climatic zones near the equator . These fluids do not only facilitate the formation of kaolinite but also enhance the quality of kaolin by depleting the argillaceous saprolite from impurities such as Fe and Ti. As a result of pH changes the distribution of labile and intermediately stable heavy minerals negatively correlates to the clay mineral variation. In the proximal parts of the basin, where the amount of kaolin is high, the prevailing heavy minerals belong to the group of ultrastable minerals such as rutile , tourmaline , and zircon , whereas more basinward where the kaolinite contents decrease in a vadose system, apatite and labile ones become the most important heavy minerals. It provides a clear proof for an increase of the alkalinity of the basinal fluids more basinward. The opposite trend is observed in the phreatic zone as the redox-sensitive heavy minerals of the Fe-Ti system are considered. They show a positive trend along with kaolin from the basin edge to the basin center, particularly in terms of the valence state of Fe, which changes from the trivalent to the bivalent state. Parent material Kaolin can evolve on almost all lithologies. The likelihood increases with an increase in Al and Si, but even lithologies depleted in these elements such as carbonates form, in places, a good substrate to develop kaolin, provided enough time was given to the process of alteration and the climatic regime and geodynamic setting work hand in hand. The only lithology and environments which fail to bring about kaolin deposits are salt deposits and zones of extreme evaporation. The climatic and hydrological conditions are more crucial as to the formation of secondary kaolin deposits than the composition of the parent material. Kaolin is a non-metallic raw material which has taken a position covering the entire spectrum from high-place value commodities when used for ceramics (e.g. bricks, earthenware) to the high-unit-value commodities in use for the body of the finest chinaware or even pharmaceuticals. Due to its wide range of final applications, methods and geophysical techniques (PIMA) are currently enhanced to preselect high quality kaolin and get rid of ingredients detrimental to the (high) end product. Requirements of kaolin are discussed in this review as to its use for different final products. Attention has been paid to the formation of geogenic dioxin in sedimentary/secondary kaolin which is closely related to the environment. Kaolin is not only a raw material for one of the finest products, porcelain, but also a type mineral for a varied spectrum of environments of deposition characterized by a rather sharp upper limit of formation of 390 ± 10 °C at a pressure of 2000 bar. For all geoscientists dealing with processes below this physical-chemical boundary, the role of kaolin and its mineralogical constituents as marker cannot be overestimated. ]"

Eighty-two articles have been found in literature during 1959–2000. A total of 120 substances were investigated using 65 different macroalgae species. About one-third of the tested compounds were organic substances (33%), another third metal-organic substances (35%), and the last third were oils (14%), metals (8%), detergents (7.5%) and other inorganic chemicals (2.5%). Half of the substances were only tested once on a single species. Likewise, toxicity data has only been reported for one chemical tested on a single occasion for about half of the 65 species. Thus little is known about the toxic effects on marine macroalgae. The objectives of the previous studies undertaken varied and therefore the toxicity data was presented in numerous ways, e.g. using different exposure times, temperature, light intensity, light regime, salinity, and nutrients, which makes a direct comparison of the data difficult. This review also shows that many stages in the lifecycle of macroalgae are often more sensitive to toxic substances than other aquatic organisms. Consequently, tests using macroalgae may discover toxicity earlier, which would in turn also protect the fauna. If toxic compounds have a negative affect on the distribution and growth of structurally and functionally dominating macroalgae, there may indirectly be a large and harmful influence on the whole marine coastal ecosystem. For this reason tests on macroalgae should be included in control programs along the coasts. ]"

To verify and evaluate the performance of this 4D-Var method, a suite of numerical experiments are conducted for a storm surge case using model-generated “pseudo-observations”. The pseudo-observations are generated by a nested-grid high-resolution numerical model which is coupled to an inundation/drying scheme that is not included in the original POM. The 4D-Var algorithm based on POM is tested thoroughly for both code accuracy and the potential application in storm surge forecasting. The assimilation cycles lead to effective convergence between the forecasts and the “observations”. Assimilating water level alone or together with surface currents both lead to significant improvements in storm surge forecasts within and several hours beyond the data assimilation window. It is worth noting that, assimilating water level alone produces improvements in storm surge forecasts that are comparable to those by assimilating both water level and surface currents, suggesting that optimizations of water level and surface currents are linked through the 4D-Var assimilation cycles. However, it is also worth noting that, the benefit resulting from the reduction of initial error in water level and/or surface currents through data assimilation decreases rapidly in time outside the assimilation window. This suggests that determining initial conditions of water level and/or surface currents via data assimilation is only effective within and a few hours beyond the assimilation window for storm surge forecasting. Thus, alternative data assimilation approaches are needed to improve the accuracy and lead time in operational storm surge forecasting. ]"

Few articles fully conceptualise social sustainability in an MSP context. Social sustainability in MSP is unevenly covered with bias towards stakeholder participation. Few articles provide insights that could be viably adopted in MSP practice. Co-production research, linking scholars, practitioners and society actors, is needed. , A number of commentators have argued that up until now marine/maritime spatial planning (MSP) research and practice have been dominated by blue economy and environmental concerns and have tended to neglect what might be regarded as social sustainability concerns. To gain more insight into the character and extent of such a gap, as well as how to address it, this article examines how social sustainability has been addressed in peer reviewed scientific articles on MSP between 2005 and 2020. Using search terms such as participation, democracy, social inclusion, social cohesion, equity we systematically identify and review 310 scientific articles that address diverse social sustainability concerns within MSP and marine governance. The review showed that very few papers systematically conceptualised or developed a coherent framework for engaging with social sustainability. Instead, they mostly addressed particular social concerns including participation and engagement, equity and social justice, socio-cultural values and preferences. Marine management and planning efficiency, as well as related instrumental framings of the merits of participation were the key arguments for including these dimensions of social sustainability in MSP. In terms of how to better include social sustainability in MSP, most attention was given to social-cultural mapping and ways to improve social inclusion/participation while also redressing exclusion and maldistribution of outcomes in MSP practice. We conclude that there is a need to deepen and diversify MSP inquiry with respect to social sustainability. In particular, scholars would do well to delve deeper and more broadly in social science literature to find inspiration on ways to understand and elucidate social issues. Here, the enormous body of relevant work on justice, power, critical institutionalism, political ecology and terrestrial planning literatures has hardly been tapped. It is also evident from this review that there is a need for both the academic and practice-based communities to more comprehensively address how the multidimensions of social sustainability interact with each other, as well as with economic and environmental aspects of marine planning and governance. Based on these observations, we highlight a set of suggestions on how to develop MSP research and practice on social sustainability. Most importantly, we argue that more in-depth co-production, linking scholars, practitioners and society actors, is needed. ]"

Gravel pit lakes abruptly intersect the geologic layering creating an environment where surface and groundwater will interact and where elaborate food webs can develop. Here we preview previous work on gravel pit lakes and compiled a comprehensive hydrochemical database to compare the chemistry of gravel pit lake water with other types of surface and groundwater. Water budget calculations confirm that gravel pit lakes cause freshwater loss in temperate and Mediterranean climates where surface water evaporation is larger than the actual evapotranspiration of vegetated land that was replaced by the gravel pit lakes. Groundwater fed gravel pit lakes where evaporated water is replaced by groundwater are especially sensitive to climate change. The gravel pit lakes included in this review have a relatively low acidity and high alkalinity most likely caused by weathering and leaching of carbonates in the catchment. The inflow of groundwater is a key process in gravel pit lakes with important consequences. The creation or presence of the gravel pit lakes may induce fluctuation of the up-stream water table which enhances groundwater flow and redox reactions in the soil. Groundwater rich in dissolved elements typically meets more alkaline water in gravel pit lakes enhancing the precipitation of metal oxides , calcite and other composite minerals including phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca) and carbon (C). Gravel pit lakes provide many different ecological habitats increasing the biodiversity in typically an agricultural or urban setting. Plant and animal species observed in gravel pit lakes consists of phytoplankton , zooplankton, micro plankton , macrophytes , fish and birds similar to natural lakes but the fact that gravel pit lakes may be only groundwater fed, or instead in open contact with rivers causes large variations between the ecosystem of different lakes. Plants and animal species take part in the chemical cycling of gravel pit lakes by, among others, uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and nitrogen (N 2 ), of dissolved compounds including bicarbonate (HCO 3 ), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn); of elements including phosphate (P) and Fe from lake sediments , and carbon mineralization and burial. Gravel pit lakes may contribute to denitrification of groundwater as N is consumed by plankton , but they may also enhance the mobilization of soil-bound compounds like potentially toxic (trace) metals released from aquifer sediments. The creation of gravel pit lakes provides more available sites for carbon burial but once deposited on the lake bottom, metals and other elements may be released again due to redox cycling, influenced by climatic or land use change . Gravel pit lakes are water bodies of recent formation and so far only a few different settings have been studied in detail compared to other types of natural- and man-made lakes. From this review it is evident that gravel pit lakes are hydrochemically most similar to so called ‘marl lakes’ or ‘nutrient rich’ lakes. Key areas for further research include the study of gravel pit lakes in other settings to better separate the similarities and differences between natural and gravel pit lakes. Also the feedback mechanisms between change in land use and climate, ground- and lake water chemistry ecological functioning and use of the gravel pit lakes need to be addressed. ]"

In addition, due to the milder climate than Polar regions, the annual maximum ice extent is highly variable, and rain and freeze-melt cycles can occur throughout winter. Up to 35% of the sea ice mass can be composed from metamorphic snow, rather than frozen seawater, and in places snow and superimposed ice can make up to 50% of the total ice thickness. There is pronounced atmospheric deposition of inorganic nutrients and heavy metals onto the ice, and in the Bothnian Bay it is estimated that 5% of the total annual flux of nitrogen and phosphorus and 20–40% of lead and cadmium may be deposited onto the ice fields from the atmosphere. It is yet unclear whether or not the ice is simply a passive store for atmospherically deposited compounds, or if they are transformed through photochemical processes or biological accumulation before released at ice and snow melt. As in Polar sea ice, the Baltic ice can harbour rich biological assemblages, both within the ice itself, and on the peripheries of the ice at the ice/water interface. Much progress has been made in recent years to study the composition of these assemblages as well as measuring biogeochemical processes within the ice related to those in underlying waters. The high dissolved organic matter loading of Baltic waters and ice result in the ice having quite different chemical characteristics than those known from Polar Oceans. The high dissolved organic material load is also responsible in large degree to shape the optical properties of Baltic Sea ice, with high absorption of solar radiation at shorter wavelengths, a prerequisite for active photochemistry of dissolved organic matter. Land-fast ice in the Baltic also greatly alters the mixing characteristics of river waters flowing into coastal waters. River plumes extend under the ice to a much greater distance, and with greater stability than in ice-free conditions. Under-ice plumes not only alter the mixing properties of the waters, but also result in changed ice growth dynamics, and ice biological assemblages, with the underside of the ice being encased, in the extreme case, with a frozen freshwater layer. There is a pronounced gradient in ice types from more saline ice in the south to freshwater ice in the north. The former is characteristically more porous and supports more ice-associated biology than the latter. Ice conditions also vary considerably in different parts of the Baltic Sea, with ice persisting for over half a year in the northernmost part of the Baltic Sea, the Bothnian Bay. In the southern Baltic Sea, ice appears only during severe winters. ]"

Global fallout and PPG are the major source of Pu in the China Seas. Surface Pu activity in sediments in estuary area is lower than that in shelf region. Pu in seawater in nearshore area is scavenged more efficiently than in open sea. Analytical method for Pu analysis in small-volume seawater is highly required. , Due to atmospheric nuclear weapon tests carried out by various countries and the ground-level test series conducted at Marshall Islands by the US, marine environments have been extensively contaminated by plutonium over the Western Pacific marginal seas, especially in the China Seas. The released plutonium isotopes can serve as geochemical tracers for various physical and biogeochemical ocean processes. In this critical review, the source term, temporal-spatial distribution and geochemical behavior of plutonium isotopes in seawater and sediments in the China Seas are summarized and discussed, and then they are compared to those in the neighboring seas. A database of plutonium activity concentrations, isotope ratio, and inventories in marine environments in the China Seas is established. We concluded that global fallout and the Pacific Proving Grounds were still the major source of plutonium in the China Seas. The spatial distributions of plutonium in the China Seas indicated surface plutonium activity concentration in sediments in estuary area is lower than that in shelf region, and we thus clarified that plutonium in seawater in nearshore area is scavenged more efficiently than in open sea. Finally, future research needs for plutonium in marine environments are discussed. ]"

Many of these sites are faced with geological threats which could have negative effects on the value, integrity and accessibility of their heritage assets. Assessments of geological hazards susceptibility are still limited in the literature and mostly undertaken at global to continental levels. The paucity of nationwide exercises that could be carried out based on the wealth of established datasets and models available at the geological surveys proves that there is not yet a systematic Earth-science approach applied to heritage conservation. Focusing on the WHS of the UK, this paper aims to: (i) appraise the suitability of existing geohazard mapping approaches at global to continental scale, and whether an assessment at finer scale is instead required; (ii) review nationwide geological datasets available, developed and maintained at the British Geological Survey (BGS), and provide the first quantitative assessment of the full spectrum of geological and mining-related hazards affecting WHS across the country; and finally (iii) explore how such a review can fill knowledge gaps and increase awareness of geohazards in the national WHS management sector. An assessment of hazard information from published global and European scale studies using low to medium spatial resolution hazard datasets is first provided. The review then moves to the national level and reaches the scale of the individual WHS, accounting for the extent of their Core Area, Buffer Zone and Sensitive Area as designated by UNESCO , and their geological and geohazard peculiarity. We analyse the whole spectrum of BGS datasets, including: six GeoSure ground stability products, aggressive ground conditions from BGS Civils , the National Landslide Database, mass movement deposits from the Digital Geological Map of Great Britain ( DiGMapGB ), fluvial and coastal Geological Indicators of Flooding ( GIF ), and susceptibility to Groundwater Flooding ( GWF ). Mining data from BGS Mining hazard (not including coal) , British Pits ( BritPits ), as well as ARUP's review of mining instability and opencast coal data from the Coal Authority are also analysed. The review reveals that ground compressibility and uneven settlement (subsidence) and landslides are the geohazards that, with higher likelihood, may affect the integrity of the UK WHS. These geohazards show the highest percentages of total susceptible land (18.6% and 11.5%, respectively), followed by corrosive (ferrous) ground conditions (11.3%), groundwater flooding at surface (14.3%) and below ground (9.7%), liquefaction of sand deposits (10.9%) and mining hazard (8.0%). These figures highlight the granularity and diversity of the geology and hazards found across the country, as well as the improvements compared to global and continental approaches. The priorities for further studies and heritage management are therefore identified. The provision of baseline geological and hazard data contributes to raise the level of preparedness of UNESCO WHS managers and the World Heritage Committee to deal with natural hazards. Review of the WHS periodic reports – cycle II (2008–2015) reveals the current level of geological hazard awareness at the UNESCO properties and identifies where activities of knowledge transfer to site managers could help to improve the understanding of geological threats. ]"

The region shows contrasting geographic and climatic properties, which have conditioned past and present glacial activity. This paper constitutes a review of the spatial and temporal patterns of paraglacial activity across the AP bridging the geomorphological and ecological perspectives. The number and extent of ice-free environments has increased since the Last Glacial Maximum , particularly during the Early Holocene and the 20th century. Following deglaciation , the redefinition of coastlines and the uplift of landmasses proceeded differently in the three sectors of AP, with maximum uplift in the western sector (40 m a.s.l.), the minimum on the north (20.4 m a.s.l.), and intermediate in the eastern sector (30 m). There are also differences in the levels of raised beaches, with the highest complexity in the northern AP (5–7 levels) and the lowest in the eastern AP (3 levels). The transition from glacial to periglacial conditions (paraglacial stage) also differed greatly between the three sectors, with the absence of rock glaciers in the western sector, the development almost exclusively of glacier-derived rock glaciers in the eastern AP, and the majority of talus-derived rock glaciers in the northern AP. The development of protalus lobes, block streams and other periglacial features was highly dependent on the cold/warm based character of individual glaciers; this characteristic determines the existence or absence of permafrost following deglaciation which, in turn, conditions the type and intensity of geomorphic processes in newly exposed ice-free areas. More recently, following the post-1950s regional warming, there have still been important differences between the three sectors in the development of paraglacial environments. Permafrost degradation has occurred in newly exposed areas, accelerating mass wasting and sediment redistribution and changing hydrological processes, especially in the northern and western AP, while sudden glacial outburst flooding has occurred in the eastern AP. The most apparent major ecological response to this recent warming is greening due to vegetation expansion, which is more evident where paraglacial and periglacial processes are less intense. The accurate characterization of the different paraglacial responses existing in the AP enables a better understanding of future environmental responses in this climatically sensitive region, where climate models forecast significant environmental change for during forthcoming decades. ]"

Physical attributes of Qz and Ilm grains reveal transport and deposition mechanisms. Light and heavy minerals provide insightful signals of sand transport. We constructed a micrograph collection based on SEM surface texture observations. , Surface textures of quartz and ilmenite grains provide an insight in assessing current mechanical, chemical and mechanical-chemical processes in dune and beach sands of the Gulf of Mexico Coast (GMC) Mexico. The GMC area produces hybrid sands enriched in monocrystalline quartz and ilmenite-free grains. Quartz grains are observed in all dunes and beach localities of the central GMC close to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt characterized by large conchoidal fractures (&gt;100 μm), angular to subangular outlines, arcuate steps, high relief, and sharp edges associated with fluvial transport. Aeolian quartz features like meandering ridges, upturned plates, bulbous edges and adhering particles on quartz are only present in some GMC sites, whereas marine surface textures like straight and curved grooves are sparse. Chemical surface textures on quartz and ilmenite are a consequence of silica saturated low-energy subaqueous conditions and subaerial exposure, diagenesis and intermediate weathering processes in the dunes and beach sands. Ilmenite grains are common in all studied localities of the GMC, characterized by large conchoidal fractures (&gt;100 μm), angular to subangular outlines, flat cleavage surfaces, arcuate steps and high relief. In some ilmenite grains, upturned plates, meandering ridges, bulbous edges and abrasion fatigue characterize aeolian surface features. Straight and curved grooves only characterize marine surface textures. To assess the prevailing transport mechanisms along the GMC, quartz and ilmenite grains from dunes and beach sands were selected based on surface texture observations. Our findings suggest that quartz and ilmenite grains are primarily transported and deposited along the coast by riverine input, a second-cycle of aeolian transport onshore, and recycling by marine longshore currents and waves. ]"

In a context of climate change, increased risks in urban areas and growing uncertainties, urban managers are forced to innovate in order to design appropriate new risk management strategies. Among these strategies, making cities resilient has become an imperative. However, resilience remains complex to integrate into the practices of urban planners and territorial actors. Its multitude of definitions and approaches has contributed to its abstraction and lack of operationalization. This review highlights the multitude of approaches and methodologies to address the bias of the lack of integration of the concept of resilience in climate risk management. The limit is the multiplication of these strategies which lead to conceptual vagueness and a lack of tangible application at the level of local actors. The challenge would then be to design a toolbox to concentrate the various existing tools, conceptual models and decision support systems in order to facilitate the autonomy and responsibility of local stakeholders in integrating the concept of resilience into risk management strategies. ]"

In the densely populated Mekong Delta located at the mouth of the Mekong River basin in southern Vietnam, the hydrogeological systems have been transformed from an almost undisturbed to a human-impacted state and saltwater intrusion into surface water and groundwater systems has grown to be a detrimental issue recently, seriously threatening freshwater supply and degrading the eco-environment. In this article, the impacts of human activities and climate change (e.g., groundwater over-exploitation, relative sea-level rise, storm surge, changing precipitation and temperature regimes, uncontrolled drainage canals, operation of hydropower dams, and rapid development of aquaculture) on saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems in the Mekong Delta are briefly reviewed. Based on current status of research findings regarding saltwater intrusion and the subsequent groundwater quality degradation under the impacts of human activities and climate change, major knowledge gaps and challenges are identified and discussed, including thickness and permeability of the silt and clay aquitard , present-day highly heterogeneous 3D distribution of saline groundwater zones, dynamic variation of saltwater/freshwater transition zone, and the most effective and economical control measure. To bridge these gaps, future work should: 1) apply environmental isotope techniques in combination with borehole tests to gain detailed hydrogeological information regarding spatial variation of permeability and thickness of the silt and clay aquitard; 2) intensify regular groundwater monitoring and collect as much groundwater samples from multiple hydro-stratigraphic units at different depths as possible to visualize the present-day highly heterogeneous 3D distribution of saline groundwater; 3) develop a series of variable-density coupled groundwater flow and salt transport models representing various scenarios of human activities and climate change for predicting future extent of saltwater intrusion; and 4) identify the dominant factor causing saltwater intrusion and determine the most effective and economical engineering technique to address saltwater intrusion problems in the Mekong Delta. ]"

The processes of disasters following tsunamis have also become more complex with global impacts. The broad economic and political consequences of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami encouraged the global community to consider the problem of “cascading disasters”. We can categorized the cause and damage due to the 2011 tsunami with incentive and predisposing factors, impact as compound disaster. We also proposed and developed various tsunami fragility functions as essential tools to assess and mitigate damage such as casualties, house/building, marine vessels, pedestrian bridges, road bridges and aquaculture rafts. The process of cascading disasters still remains as major issue and should be studied together with the factors of interdependencies, vulnerabilities, amplification, secondary disasters and critical infrastructure and spin-off effects. Another important issue concerns non-seismic tsunamis, such as those that impacted Palu and Sunda Straight in Indonesia in 2018. These events demonstrated the difficulties and remaining problems regarding tsunami warning and evacuation and the difficulties of real time monitoring and detection. Since tsunamis are low-frequency, high-impact natural hazards, interdisciplinary research on risk perception, awareness, memory and lessons becomes critically important. The process of sharing tsunami experiences underwent a transformation in the form of digital archives and new media in response to the needs and opportunities for disaster risk reduction (DRR) in the 21st century.

Brackish water is often defined as having salinity lower than that of standard seawater but higher than that of freshwater, but less regard is given to the origin of the salts involved. The simple dilution of standard seawater by freshwater in a coastal or estuarine setting constitutes a brackish environment , but so do lakes where continental fresh water is impounded and becomes more saline through a variety of solute evolution pathways. The range of potential compositions of brackish lake water is diverse and includes water with “seawater-like” compositions. Isolated brackish lake environments located hundreds of kilometers inland can evolve towards sodium chloride-dominated, low alkalinity environments that mimic the composition of brackish seawater environments. These types of lakes can harbor a variety of continentally invasive but typically marine organisms, including but not limited to algae, foraminifers, mollusks, diatoms, and crustaceans. Distinguishing brackish marine from brackish lake environments in the geologic record can be difficult. In this paper, the enigmatic late Miocene and early Pliocene southern Bouse Formation of southern Arizona and California, USA, considered by many to represent a marine transgression along the lower Colorado River corridor, is discussed within a broad framework that incorporates hydrochemical, biogeographical, and species niche concepts. A brackish lake interpretation provides a powerful platform that can comprehensively account for the enigmatic mixed marine and continental fossil assemblage and possible tidal rhythmites that feature prominently in the southern Bouse Formation controversy. A review of the broader regional (paleo)environmental context for the southern Bouse supports a sodium chloride-dominated, low alkalinity, mildly brackish (10-5 ppt) Colorado River-fed lake depositional environment that was populated by an intriguing but predictable array of euryhaline, opportunistic, and continentally invasive marginal marine organisms. ]"

This area is characterised by the occurrence of five orders of alluvial terraces that are striking features of the landscape, where large and steep catchments debouch from the mountain front to the hilly coastal belt. Field investigations indicate that the deposits of all five terraces are suggestive of shallow gravel-bed braided streams. On the basis of the age of the Pleistocene substratum and morphostratigraphic correlation with marine terraces cropping out in the nearby areas, each order has been associated to specific marine oxygen isotope stages. Consequently, we focused on the interplay of allocyclic factors influencing stream aggradation/degradation. Soil features and other climatic proxies suggest that climate didn't play an important role with respect to tectonic and base-level changes in controlling fluvial dynamics. In particular, we recognised that during the middle Pleistocene the study area experienced a period of subaerial landscape modelling, as suggested by the thick and complex alluvial sequence of the highest terrace (T1). The onset of regional uplift marks a change in the geomorphic scenario, with tectonic and eustatically driven changes in base-level working together in causing switches in fluvial aggradational/erosional phases (T2–T5 terraces). Because of the uplift, river dissection occurred during phases of sea level fall, whereas aggradation phases occurred during periods of climate amelioration (sea level rise) just before highstands were attained. As a consequence, the stepped terraces in the study area reflect the interplay between tectonics (uplift) and sea level changes, in which terraces define episodes of relative sea level fall during the late Quaternary. ]"

In this study we investigate the Southern Central Andes, between 22° and 35°S, by examining the along-strike variations in Cenozoic uplift history (&lt;45 Ma) and the amount of tectonic shortening-thickening, allowing us to construct seven continental-scale cross-sections that are constrained by a new thermomechanical model. Our goal is to reconcile the kinematic model explaining crustal shortening-thickening and deformation with the geological constraints of this subduction-related orogen. To achieve this goal a representation of the thermomechanical structure of the orogen is constructed, and the results are applied to constrain the main decollement active for the last 15 Myr. Afterwards, the structural evolution of each transect is kinematically reconstructed through forward modeling, and the proposed deformation evolution is analyzed from a geodynamic perspective through the development of a numerical 2D geodynamic model of upper-plate lithospheric shortening. In this model, low-strength zones at upper-mid crustal levels are proposed to act both as large decollements that are sequentially activated toward the foreland and as regions that concentrate most of the orogenic deformation. As the orogen evolves, crustal thickening and heating lead to the vanishing of the sharp contrast between low- and high-strength layers. Therefore, a new decollement develops towards the foreland, concentrating crustal shortening , uplift and exhumation and, in most cases, focusing shallow crustal seismicity . The north-south decrease in shortening, from 325 km at 22°S to 46 km at 35°S, and the cumulated orogenic crustal thicknesses and width are both explained by transitional stages of crustal thickening : from pre-wedge, to wedge, to paired-wedge and, finally, to plateau stages. ]"

Despite the increasing health impacts of climate change and disaster risks felt in Asian countries such as China, Indonesia and Vietnam, there are few attempts to access and translate literature and evidence on climate-related disasters and adaptation activities from non-English speaking countries. Conducted by a multi-country project team, this review aims to better understand the current literature and to study gaps in these three countries through an extensive search of literature, in English, Chinese, Indonesian and Vietnamese. Through a systematic review process a total of 298 studies out of 10,139 were included in this study. Key findings confirm that all three countries have experienced increasing climate-related disasters with their associated health impacts, and that adaptation strategies are urgently needed to reduce the risk and vulnerability of the most affected populations. Future studies should consider conducting vulnerability assessments to inform translational research on developing effective adaptation strategies. Authors commented that a common challenge they found was the shortterm nature of disaster response mechanisms, and the lack of long-term investment and policy support for capacity building and multi-sectoral collaborative research that address the needs of populations vulnerable to climate-related disasters. Thus, to better prepare for future disasters, it is vital that governments and international agencies prioritize funding policies to fill this gap. ]"

The variability in DMSP concentration was considered relative to biological criteria. Ability of heterotrophic dinoflagellates to synthesise DMSP argues for a photosynthetic ancestor. , More than 20 years ago Maureen Keller and co-workers published a study that identified dinoflagellates as an important marine phytoplankton group with respect to the production of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP). Here, we present a synthesis and analysis of all the DMSP and DMSP lyase activity (DLA) measurements currently available for dinoflagellates. The data cover 110 species and strains and reveal over 6 orders of magnitude variability in intracellular DMSP concentrations and substantial variations in DLA in 23 strains. Inter-specific variability was explored with reference to a range of biological characteristics. The presence of a theca did not appear to be related to DMSP concentration but there was a potential relationship with toxicity ( P = 0.06) and bioluminescent species produced significantly lower concentrations ( P &lt; 0.01) than non-bioluminescent ones. DMSP concentrations were related to plastid types ( P &lt; 0.05); dinoflagellates with haptophyte-like plastids contained lower amounts of DMSP than those with peridinin plastids ( P &lt; 0.01), whereas those containing cryptomonad-like plastids tended to have higher DMSP concentrations. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates were also considered given their importance in the natural environment. They are the only heterotrophs known to synthesise DMSP and this ability may support the theory that they are of photosynthetic origin. However, the heterotrophic species investigated so far suggest wide variability in DMSP content and the species Oxyrrhis marina had no detectable DMSP. The oceanic province of origin significantly affected the DMSP concentrations ( P &lt; 0.05) with higher DMSP content observed in dinoflagellates from the Mediterranean province, the Kuroshio Current province and the East Coastal Australian province. Overall this study supports the concept that DMSP-containing dinoflagellates are an important potential source of DMS to the global atmosphere and highlights current gaps in knowledge. ]"

Undaria pinnatifida has been highly successful at increasing its range in Australasia and can be a conspicuous component of coastal ecosystems. Evidence of significant direct impacts of this invader on native taxa are scant and conflict with its status as one of the world's worst invaders. Anthropogenic vectors, artificial substrata, the absence of native canopy algae and facilitation by native species promote invasion success. Eradication is unlikely to have widespread success, but management might reduce the risk of incursion in pristine areas. We highlight many research gaps that need to be filled, if a fuller understanding of Undaria invasion is to be achieved. , Marine invasive macroalgae can have severe local-scale impacts on ecological communities. The kelp Undaria pinnatifida is one of the most successful marine invasive species worldwide, and is widely regarded as one of the worst. Here, we review research on Undaria in Australasia, where the kelp is established throughout much of New Zealand and south-eastern Australia. The presence of Undaria for at least three decades in these locations makes Australasia one of the longest-invaded bioregions globally, and a valuable case study for considering Undaria 's invasion success and associated impacts. In Australasia, Undaria has primarily invaded open spaces, turf communities, and gaps in native canopies within a relatively narrow elevation band on rocky shores. Despite its high biomass, Undaria has relatively few direct impacts on native species, and can increase community-wide attributes such as primary productivity and the provision of biogenic habitat. Therefore, Australasian Undaria research provides an example of a decoupling between the success and impact of an invasive species. Undaria will most likely continue to spread along thousands of kilometres of rocky coastline in temperate Australasia, due to its tolerance to large variations in temperature, ability to exploit disturbances to local communities, and the continued transfer among regions via vessel movements and aquaculture activities. However, the spread of Undaria remains difficult to manage as eradication is challenging and seldom successful. Therefore, understanding potential invasion pathways, maintaining native canopy-forming species that limit Undaria success, and effectively managing anthropogenic vectors of Undaria spread, should be key management priorities. ]"

The scope of Devonian trees impact on weathering and soil production is still uncertain. Biogeomorphic Ecosystem Engineering concept can support Devonian Plant Hypothesis. New geochemical and isotopic data support abiotic origin of many global events during the Devonian , Evolution of terrestrial plants, the first vascular plants , the first trees, and then whole forest ecosystems had far reaching consequences for Earth system dynamics. These innovations are considered important moments in the evolution of the atmosphere, biosphere , and oceans, even if the effects might have lagged by hundreds of thousands or millions of years. These fundamental changes in the Earth's history happened in the Paleozoic: from the Ordovician , the time of the first land plants, to the Carboniferous, dominated by forest ecosystems. The Devonian Plant Hypothesis (DPH) was the first concept to offer a full and logical explanation of the many environmental changes associated with the evolution of trees/forests that took place during this time period. The DPH highlighted the impact of deep-rooted vascular plants, particularly trees on weathering processes, pedogenesis , nutrient transport, CO 2 cycling, organic and inorganic carbon deposition, and suggests further possible consequences on the marine realm (oceanic anoxia and extinction during the Late Devonian). Here we attempt to combine the DPH and the related expansion in biodiversity, the Devonian Plant Explosion (DePE), with the Biogeomorphic Ecosystem Engineering (BEE) concept. This idea connects tree growth and activity with initiation and/or alteration of geomorphic processes , and therefore the creation or deterioration of geomorphic landforms . We focus on trees and forest ecosystems, as the assumed dominant driver of plant-initiated change. We find that whereas there is a broad evidence of trees as important biogeomorphic ecosystem engineers, addressing the DPH is difficult due to limited, difficult to interpret, or controversial data. However, we argue the concept of BEE does shed new light on DPH and suggest new data sources that should be able to answer our main question: were Devonian trees Biogeomorphic Ecosystem engineers? ]"

In this article, we review a number of sedimentary provenance investigations aiming to constrain the drainage evolution of the main rivers draining eastern Tibet , including the Mekong, Red, Pearl, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers. The Mekong River was formed no later than ~17 Ma, likely triggered by a period of enhanced East Asian summer monsoon precipitation during the middle Miocene . A single large paleo-Red River draining the southeastern Tibetan Plateau into the Song Hong - Yinggehai Basin had been proposed to explain the unusual drainage pattern. However, this is not compatible with the distinctive provenance signals in the southeastern Tibetan river sands compared with the Song Hong - Yinggehai Basin, indicating that there has been no large-scale paleo-Red River since the late Eocene . The Pearl River has formed during the late Oligocene , as there was a sharp provenance change in the Pearl River Mouth Basin. Moreover, rivers draining southeast coastal China (e.g., Min River) migrated westward at the same time. These clues highlight that paleo-rivers in southeastern China started to migrate inland during the Late Oligocene . In contrast, the formation timing of the Yangtze River is still under intensively debated, ranging from late Cretaceous to Holocene , mainly due to the complex evolution history of this trans-continental river. The formation of the First Bend of the Yangtze River likely happened during the late Eocene , resulting from changes in the regional topographic gradient triggered by local magmatic activity and/or movement of the Ailao Shan-Red River Fault. Onshore and offshore provenance evidence indicate that incision of the Three Gorges happened no later than the late Miocene . Formation of the Square Bend of the Yellow River occurred prior to the late Pliocene , while incision of the Sanmen Gorge, a key capture point connecting the upper-middle and lower Yellow River likely occurred in the early Pleistocene (~1.2 Ma). Multi-provenance proxies on well-dated and continuous sedimentary records can provide objective information in terms of the origin and evolution of the major rivers flowing from eastern Tibet . Although the evolution of these rivers remains debatable, a comparison among the river evolution , climatic and tectonic events suggests that Eocene local and isolated drainage patterns is likely related to the dry climate condition in the East Asia. Oligocene and late Miocene inlandward expansion and integration of rivers coincides with both the formation of the East Asian Monsoon and the timing of major tectonic events, such as the growth of the Tibetan Plateau and the rifting and opening of the eastern Asian marginal basins , highlighting the importance of climate and tectonics in controlling the evolution of major rivers. ]"

It is capable of moving among the geosphere, cryosphere , atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere . This flow of carbon is referred to as the Earth's carbon cycle . It is also intimately linked to the cycling of other elements and compounds. The ocean plays a fundamental role in Earth's carbon cycle, helping to regulate atmospheric CO 2 concentration. The ocean biological carbon pump (OBCP), defined as a set of processes that transfer organic carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, is at the heart of the ocean carbon cycle. Monitoring the OBCP is critical to understanding how the Earth's carbon cycle is changing. At present, satellite remote sensing is the only tool available for viewing the entire surface ocean at high temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we review methods for monitoring the OBCP with a focus on satellites. We begin by providing an overview of the OBCP, defining and describing the pools of carbon in the ocean, and the processes controlling fluxes of carbon between the pools, from the surface to the deep ocean, and among ocean, land and atmosphere. We then examine how field measurements, from ship and autonomous platforms, complement satellite observations, provide validation points for satellite products and lead to a more complete view of the OBCP than would be possible from satellite observations alone. A thorough analysis is then provided on methods used for monitoring the OBCP from satellite platforms, covering current capabilities, concepts and gaps, and the requirement for uncertainties in satellite products. We finish by discussing the potential for producing a satellite-based carbon budget for the oceans, the advantages of integrating satellite-based observations with ecosystem models and field measurements, and future opportunities in space, all with a view towards bringing satellite observations into the limelight of ocean carbon research. ]"

The Chichi earthquake plays as a turning point of the relevant studies, since the 1999 coseismic surface rupture exactly follows preexisting fault scarps, created in turn by previous seismic events along the Chelungpu Fault. This fact indicates that the precise mapping on the other active faults is fundamental to predict the location of surface rupture caused by large future earthquakes. Since 1999, many trenching studies have been carried out along the Chichi earthquake fault. A few of them demonstrates that the penultimate event is as young as probably only 200–430 years old; however, some others show a rather old age of several hundreds years or even older for the last faulting event before 1999. More trenching studies are necessary for such a long fault in order to understand the possible segmentation features and the correlation of the paleoseismic events identified along the entire fault length. In addition, we further discuss the offshore faulting associated with seismic event along the eastern coast of Taiwan, where the multiple Holocene terraces are well known. ]"

Both estuarine circulation and tidal asymmetry are of great importance to the fine sediment processes. Mean suspended sediment concentration (C̄) and bottom shear stress are the dominant physical parameters controlling the flocculation and settling velocities ( w s ) of mud flocs in suspension. Two important physical processes are revealed by acoustic imaging, i.e. (i) the near-bed impulsive resuspension and (ii) the transport processes driven by fine sediment-induced plumes during a spring tide. A turbidity maximum, associated with a suspended sediment front, is observed. Its formation is caused mainly by tidal asymmetry, near-bed periodic tidal resuspension and turbulence suppression by suspension/salinity stratifications. A conceptual sketch of the turbidity maximum is cautiously proposed for the Changjiang River estuary. Four different settling velocity equations, taking flocculation into account, have different effects on the modeled concentration profiles of fine sediment: apparently, Cao and Wang (1994, pp. 252–253) would be the best for spring tide and Thorn (1982, Fig. 3/page 66) for neap tide.

This water mass developed in the summer months, had a temperature 2–3°C above that of surrounding waters and spread in a southeastward direction to about 137° to 138°E during late summer and early autumn. Significantly colder water was consistently observed in the eastern GAB during autumn. During late autumn and winter, the Leeuwin Current was seen to intrude into the GAB region and interact with the GAB water, producing a continuous band of warm water stretching across the southern Australian coast. The development of the warm GAB water was observed to be independent of any influence of the Leeuwin Current, and it is proposed that the source of the warm GAB water is from processes local to the region. A calculated heat budget applicable to the northwestern GAB coastal region indicated that a positive net heat flux exists during spring, summer and early autumn. Large air-sea temperature differences (up to 20°C) during periods of offshore wind create a stable atmospheric boundary layer which inhibits sensible and latent heat losses. The net heat flux is almost solely attributable to the large incoming short wave radiation component under these conditions, which may be significant in maintaining the observed positive net heat flux. The region of greatest warming in the northwestern GAB is associated with a large expanse of shallow water (&lt; 30 m), and a larger temperature change in the water column over this region than over surrounding deeper regions results when a uniform positive heat flux is applied over the GAB. This is the proposed mechanism responsible for the production of the observed warm GAB water. ]"

The temporary OBS deployment at the Lesser Antilles subduction zone provides new insights into the feasibility of detecting unconventional signals such as non volcanic tremor (NVT), long-period (LP) or ultra-long period (ULP) events. Analysis of noise at an array comprising several sites and types of instruments and comparison with recordings on land shows transients in the noise. Episodes can be identified considering the diversity of sites and instrument types and comparing the seismic signals with meteorological and oceanographic data. In order to reliably detect NVT (1–10 Hz) originating from inside the solid Earth, one must first characterize noise induced by the activity of the atmosphere and hydrosphere at the sea-bottom as well as on land. The semidiurnal modulation of noise amplitude can be shown here not to be due to that of the NVT from a seismic source at depth which is related to the subduction interplate and whose activity is modulated by the tidal stresses as inferred for other megathrusts on emerged forearcs. Here, the semidiurnal modulation is rather due to the effect of the tides themselves, such as tidal currents, since they do not affect all types and all components of the unique multi-station array of OBS that could be deployed on this submerged forearc. The short period cut-off of the strong noise due to ocean surface infragravity waves increases to longer periods with OBS depth, thereby increasing the observational window with low noise to lower frequencies, and deep OBS sites may be advantageous for detecting LP events. ]"

A surface mixed layer of temperature T m is imbedded in the upper layer of the model, and entrainment and detrainment in the mixed layer are determined by wind stirring and surface cooling. There is also detrainment w d through the base of the upper layer that models subduction. Monthly climatological data, including air temperature T a and specific humidity q a , are used to force the model, and model sea surface temperature (SST), T m , is used to determine the sensible and latent heat fluxes. With a few notable exceptions, our main-run solution compares well with observed current and SST data; this is particularly true for T m , which typically differs from observed SST by less than 0.5–1.0°C. Our analyses focus on three topics: the relative importance of remote versus local forcing, the thermodynamic processes that determine the model SST field, and the development of meridional circulation cells. There are a number of examples of remotely forced circulations in our main run. During the spring a northeastward countercurrent flows against the prevailing winds along the Somali coast north of 4°N, and from October through February a southwestward Somali Undercurrent is present from the tip of Somalia to 3°N; both of these flows result in part from forcing during the previous Southwest Monsoon. From March through May there is another southwestward Somali Undercurrent south of 7°N, generated primarily by the propagation of a Rossby wave from the west coast of India. The currents along the west coast of India are either strongly influenced or dominated by remote forcing from the Bay of Bengal throughout the year. A northeastward flow is well established along the east coast of India in March, long before the onset of the Southwest Monsoon; it is remotely forced either by upwelling-favorable, alongshore winds elsewhere within the Bay of Bengal or by negative wind curl in the western Bay. Finally, the Agulhas Current is strengthened considerably in a solution that includes throughflow from the Pacific Ocean. To investigate the relative importance of thermodynamic processes, we carried out a series of test calculations with various terms dropped from the T m -equation. There is little effect on T m when the sensible heat flux is set to zero, or when the solar radiation field is replaced by a spatially smoothed version. When temperature advection is deleted, T m is most strongly affected near western boundaries since isotherms are no longer shifted there by the swift currents; the annual-mean, surface-heat-flux field Q Q is also changed, with Q Q becoming more positive (negative) to compensate for the absence of warm (cold) currents. Without entrainment cooling, T m never cools during the summer in the intense upwelling regions in the northern ocean, and the annual-mean heat gain through the ocean surface (the area integral of Q Q over the basin) reverses to become a net heat loss. In individual tests without entrainment cooling, with T a = T m , and with q a set to 80% of its saturated value q s , model SST warms near the northern and southern boundaries during their respective winters by about 1°C, indicating that several processes contribute to wintertime cooling. The T m field degrades considerably in a single test run with both T a = T m and q a = 0.8q s , so that one or the other of these external forcing fields is required to be able to simulate SST accurately. The annual-mean circulation has two meridional circulation cells. In the Tropical Cell, water subducts in the southern ocean, flows equatorward in the lower layer of the western-boundary current, and is entrained back into the upper layer in the open-ocean upwelling regions in the southern ocean. In the Cross-Equatorial Cell, the subducted water crosses the equator near the western boundary, where it is entrained in the regions of intense coastal upwelling in the northern ocean. The strength of the cells is directly related to the assumed magnitude of the subduction rate w d , but their structure is not sensitive to the particular parameterization of w d used. ]"

In particular, many numerical modeling studies have attempted to explain the longevity of steep escarpments that formed along continental edges at the transition between low elevation coastal plains and high elevation continental interiors , such as along the coasts of Africa and South America on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean. In this paper, I review the wide and diverse body of observational constraints gathered to constrain the formation and evolution of passive margins escarpments, as well as the various mechanisms that have been proposed to explain their anomalously high topography. I then compile and summarize the findings of numerous numerical modeling studies that have been performed in the past twenty years to explain their formation and evolution. I show that many of these studies converged to agree that the longevity of passive margin escarpments depends on how rapidly they become and remain regional drainage divides and that this is primarily controlled by the flexural isostatic rebound associated with the erosion of the high elevation continental interior. To better quantify these findings, I derive and present a new analytical expression for the migration velocity of an escarpment once it has become a drainage divide. This expression is validated by a series of numerical experiments using 1D and 2D high resolution landscape evolution models. Interestingly, these models also predict that the rate of erosion at or near escarpments can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the rate of escarpment retreat. This may explain the apparent discrepancy between the low estimates of present-day erosion rates obtained mostly from cosmogenic nuclide studies (10m/Myr) and the long-term rates of escarpment retreat (1km/Myr). ]"

The two unconformities described (the Base Miocene Unconformity and the younger Deep Regional Unconformity) were both produced when deformation abruptly stopped, leaving erosional surfaces that were then transgressed. The ages of these two events are c. 24 and 12–13 Ma respectively, and the areas affected by the prior uplift and erosion can be mapped. The results are incompatible with widely cited plate tectonic models that describe closure of a postulated Proto-South China Sea [PSCS]. These prior models had assumed plate drift ended with collision at plate docking over a PSCS suture in about mid Early Miocene times. However, stratigraphic data shows that Early Miocene times were a period of quiescence across Sabah, with mostly mild subsidence . It is therefore proposed that plate drift in the SCS could not have been linked to any type of subduction process anywhere around western Sabah. The absence of any plate docking or any Oligocene through Middle Miocene compression around northern Palawan is a further anomaly to the old subduction based tectonic model. ]"

The long-term dynamics of the HC ecosystem are controlled by shifts between alternating anchovy and sardine regimes that restructure the entire ecosystem from phytoplankton to the top predators. These regime shifts are caused by lasting periods of warm or cold temperature anomalies related to the approach or retreat of warm subtropical oceanic waters to the coast of Peru and Chile. Phases with mainly negative temperature anomalies parallel anchovy regimes (1950–1970; 1985 to the present) and the rather warm period from 1970 to 1985 was characterized by sardine dominance. The transition periods (turning points) from one regime to the other were 1968–1970 and 1984–1986. Like an El Nino, the warm periods drastically change trophic relationships in the entire HC ecosystem, exposing the Peruvian anchovy to a multitude of adverse conditions. Positive temperature anomalies off Peru drive the anchovy population close to the coast as the coastal upwelling cells usually offer the coolest environment, thereby substantially decreasing the extent of the areas of anchovy distribution and spawning. This enhances the effects of negative density-dependent processes such as egg and larval cannibalism and dramatically increases its catchability. Increased spatial overlap between anchovies and the warmer water preferring sardines intensifies anchovy egg mortality further as sardines feed heavily on anchovy eggs. Food sources for juvenile and adult anchovies which prey on a mixed diet of phyto- and zooplankton are drastically reduced because of decreased plankton production due to restricted upwelling in warm years, as demonstrated by lower zooplankton and phytoplankton volumes and the diminution of the fraction of large copepods, their main food source. Horse mackerel and mackerel, the main predators of anchovy, increase predation pressure on juvenile and adult anchovies due to extended invasion into the anchovy habitat in warmer years. In contrast to these periods of warm and cold temperature anomalies on the decadal scale, ENSO events do not play an important role for long-term anchovy dynamics, as the anchovy can recover even from strong ENSO events within 1–2 years. Consequently, the strong 1972–1973 ENSO event (in combination with overfishing) was not the cause of the famous crash of the Peruvian anchovy fishery in the 1970s. ]"

The northern half of South America is taken as a case study to explore the relations between (i) continental tectonic boundary conditions (active / passive margin, orogenic activity) and intracontinental deformation, (ii) the spatial distribution of clastic sediment sources and sinks over the continent and its margins and (iii) the configuration of the main sediment routes. To do that, the evolving surface configuration of northern South America is investigated through a series of 10 paleo-geological maps compiled for key periods of the Meso-Cenozoic. The maps display (i) sedimentation areas and their depositional environments , (ii) sediment transport routes based on paleocurrent measurements and provenance studies, (iii) magmatic occurrences, (iv) active faults, (v) denudation/burial histories deduced from low-temperature thermochronology studies and (vi) areas of extensive Cenozoic lateritic cover. Three main successive continental-scale regimes of the source-to-sink systems are documented. An early erosional regime until ca. 125 Ma is attested to by a major sedimentary hiatus over a long-lasting asthenosphere-supported eroding superswell at the scale of northern South America and northwestern Africa. Sediments were routed from the superswell to the proto-Andean marginal basins , the Central Atlantic rifts/rifted margin basins and the Saharan cratonic basin. After ca. 125 Ma, a cratonic regime of mixed erosion/deposition established and maintained until the onset of the Andean orogeny at ca. 85 Ma. During this period, sediment routes from eroding cratonic domains to the proto-Andean margin basins were episodically closed by inherited Paleozoic structures (i.e., “arches”), whilst sediment fluxes to cratonic or rifted margin basins were partitioned by Atlantic rift shoulders / marginal upwarps of evolving amplitude that formed transient continental divides. After ca. 85 Ma, an Andes-dominated regime installed, in which Andean retro-foreland basins became the main sinks for orogenic sediment fluxes, while exchanges with cratonic basins were controlled by the topographic expression of foreland basins forebulges. Under that regime, cratonic domains mainly acted as by-pass zones for clastic sediments, and their extensive Paleogene and Lower Neogene lateritic covers argue for limited clastic exports from areas exposed to erosion. Very-long wavelength (x 1000 km) asthenospheric support, long-wavelength (x 100 km) lithospheric-scale deformation / vertical movements and climate-controlled erosion processes interacted to regulate cratonic sediment source-to-sink regimes of northern South America since 250 Ma. ]"

However, current carbon budget estimates show that respiration throughout the ocean far exceeds surface primary production. This disconnect can be grouped into two categories: Inaccurate estimates of water column respiration and carbon transport from metazoans ; and missing primary production sources and. heterotrophic processing in the dark ocean. In this review, we examine the contribution to the ocean carbon cycle of chemoautotrophic production, as well as secondary production and respiration from meso-zooplankton and micro-nekton below 400 m depth. About one-third of epipelagic biomass in the ocean migrates diurnally, distributing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total nitrogen (TN), along with about 30–80% of the particulate organic carbon (POC) flux, from the upper ocean. Although mostly this occurs in the upper 400 m, migration depths can extend to 3000 m. In addition, up to 80% of the biomass of secondary consumers in the open ocean live part of their life cycle at depths up to 2000 m, contributing significantly to deep-sea respiration and particle flux , particularly over fall/winter in temperate-subarctic oceans, submarine canyons , and deep seas such as the Mediterranean. This active flux provides fresh organic input to the deep ocean at a time of year when surface primary productivity, and thus organic carbon (OC) flux to the deep ocean, is low. The complex spatial, temporal and depth scales of horizontal and vertical migration make modelling of the global oceanic carbon cycle extremely complex, requiring consideration of biomass movements throughout the entire water column over diurnal, lunar and seasonal cycles over broad geographic regions. An additional 10 to 50% of surface primary production occurs within mid-depth oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), fuelled by ammonia excreted from vertically migrating zooplankton concentrated near OMZ boundaries. Crustal sources such as gas and methane seeps, hydrothermal vents and submarine volcanoes support active deep-sea food webs, as well as contributing to upper ocean productivity. Crustal sources are conservatively estimated to provide &gt;30%, and probably up to 50%, of oceanic OC flux to the dark ocean. These estimates are still poorly constrained but can no longer be ignored in global oceanic carbon cycles. ]"

The occurrence of seafloor landslides on the MRDF has been recognized since the 1950s, but the bulk of research on the topic was conducted in the 1970s-80s after seafloor landslides triggered by Hurricane Camille damaged offshore infrastructure. Through these efforts, it was recognized that seafloor instability features are present across the entire delta front, that rapid sediment delivery from the Mississippi River is a primary preconditioning factor for failures, and that cyclic loading from hurricane waves is the main triggering mechanism for deep-seated catastrophic events. However, mounting evidence shows that MRDF seafloor motion occurs even during periods of no hurricane activity, which could be attributed to creep-like motion of underconsolidated sediment, or smaller episodic flows triggered by winter storms or Mississippi River floods. Given the extensive spatial distribution of instabilities on the MRDF, the multiple mechanisms of failure and variety of resulting morphology, and the range of potential triggering mechanisms with short recurrence, the MRDF is an exceptional location to assess the complex problem of seafloor landslides. An improved understanding of seafloor landslides is crucial for understanding global sediment budgets and associated biogeochemical cycling, as they can evacuate large volumes of sediment into deep water over short time periods. Additionally, seafloor landslides pose a hazard to offshore infrastructure and to coastal communities through possible tsunami inundation, and advancing research on preconditioning factors and triggering mechanisms would improve hazard assessments. This paper presents a review and synthesis of geological and geotechnical research on the MRDF, particularly with respect to seafloor landslides: their occurrence, geological and geotechnical controls, triggering mechanisms, and knowledge gaps related thereto. This synthesis is conducted at times of rapidly developing technologies for studying seafloor instability, and as the MRDF enters a stage of degradation characterized by reduced sediment delivery and accumulation. ]"

Europe) have been strongly exploited for decades bringing them into an enduringly depleted status. Scientific cod stock related advice for targeted and mixed fisheries is provided on an annual basis by the International Council for Exploration of the Sea. This advice forms a basis for ministerial decisions on, e.g., the total allowable catch and management plans. Despite measures to reduce fishing-induced mortality of cod, such as catch and effort restrictions, increased gear selectivity , closed areas and seasons, clear signs of recovery are yet to be seen. Thus, traditional advice for the management of these stocks may have to be complemented by advice on supporting measures focusing on other pressures hampering the recovery of cod. The present study elaborates on potential supportive measures for cod stock recovery in the Baltic Sea, Kattegat, and Skagerrak (including local populations where applicable), based on current knowledge. The list of measures presented here is the outcome of in-depth discussions on the state-of-the-art knowledge, among cod experts and further with stakeholders with the aim to follow principles of ecosystem-based fisheries management. Following the identification of different pressures on and prerequisites for the separate stocks, the listed measures differ between stocks and include cod bycatch mortality reduction, alterations in fisheries affecting food sources for cod, restocking, protection of juvenile habitats, and reduced predation. The literature review and the list of measures are intended to provide decision-support for managers and policymakers aiming to provide conditions for the cod stocks to recover. ]"

An analysis of published peer-reviewed journal articles from 2000 to 2020 demonstrates an increasing trend of studies related to hypoxia in the Laurentian Great Lakes. However, the majority of these studies (78%) focus on Lake Erie and in particular the well-documented hypolimnetic hypoxic conditions that develop in the central basin of Lake Erie. This hypoxic zone is relatively large (up to 1.5 million ha), has substantial ecological effects, and motivates monitoring programs and water quality improvement initiatives. Nonetheless, the hypoxic zone in the central basin of Lake Erie is only one of over twenty documented hypoxic zones in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Moreover, hypoxic conditions in the Great Lakes are quite diverse. Here, we define and characterize a four-fold classification of Great Lakes hypoxic conditions: 1) hypolimnetic hypoxia, 2) over-winter hypoxia, 3) diel hypoxia, and 4) episodic hypoxia. We suggest that Great Lakes research and monitoring programs should seek to more broadly document hypoxic conditions and develop models to predict the temporal and spatial occurrence of hypoxia. Such efforts are particularly timely as future climatic conditions contributing to warmer temperatures, longer and more intense stratified periods, increased spring nutrient loading and more variable allocthonous inputs are expected to exacerbate three of the four hypoxic conditions described for the Great Lakes (hypolimnetic, diel, and episodic hypoxia). ]"

Analyses of the data indicate that the major portion of the water in the Equatorial Undercurrent at its beginning north of Papua New Guinea is supplied from the south by a narrow western boundary undercurrent (New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent) transporting high-salinity, low-tritium, high-oxygen, low-nutrient water from the Solomon Sea northwestward along the north coast of Papua New Guinea through the Vitiaz Strait. The New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent has a maximum speed of 40–70 cm s −1 at a depth of about 200 m. It is a permanent feature despite the reversals of the wind and the surface current during the period of the northwest monsoon in austral summer. Its transport through the Vitiaz Strait is as high as 8 × 10 6 m 3 s −1 , which is of the same magnitude as the Equatorial Undercurrent transport at 143°E. The New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent revealed by the WEPOCS data is consistent with the low-latitude equatorward western boundary current implied in a calculation of the Sverdrup transport based on the observed wind-stress distribution for the tropical Pacific Ocean. High-salinity, low-tritium, low -oxygen, high -nutrient water which flows westward into the Bismarck Sea passing north of the Solomon Islands is entrained into the Equatorial Undercurrent north of New Ireland and returns to the east, resulting in a down-stream increae in the Undercurrent transport. Low-salinity, high-tritium, high-nutrient water of eastern North Pacific origin also contributes to the Equatorial Undercurrent in its source area west of the WEPOCS region. However, there is no evidence that northern waters are being continuously entrained into the Undercurrent in the WEPOCS region. ]"

Gliding planes could be clays or sandy materials undergoing loss of strength. It is documented on some of the largest marine landslides. SubSpread Database includes 32 case studies. Contourite and glaciogenic deposits represent often the slipping surfaces. , Subaqueous spreading, a type of extensional mass transport that is characterized by a ridge and trough morphology, has been documented globally but is poorly understood. Subaqueous spreading is observed on gently inclined surfaces (typically &lt;3°) when sediment bodies experience a sudden reduction of shear strength along their basal plane during clay softening or liquefaction of sands or silty sand sediment. Historically, spreading has been associated with very large landslides, but many unknown aspects of these mass movements have yet to be clarified. Does spreading influences the large catastrophic failure? What are the sedimentological and morphological aspects that contribute in initiating this process? These are some of the research questions that spurred the present work. Here, we introduce a database that incorporates information from thirty-two case studies, and use this to provide key insights into the sedimentary and morphological aspects of subaqueous spreading that will assist in the identification of spreading elsewhere. We find that subaqueous spreading is most common along passive glacial margins, but is also observed along active margins. The occurrence of contourites interlayered with glaciogenic deposits is, in most cases, associated with landslides (or landslide complexes) with spreading morphology. The database shows that seismic loading is commonly suggested to be the dominant trigger mechanism, although more geotechnical observations and modelling analysis would be needed to support this conclusion. We compare subaqueous spreading with terrestrial spreading, in particular to earthquake-related lateral spreading and clay landslides. We find that subaqueous spreading shares the same driving processes and potentially also some of the trigger mechanisms that are associated with the terrestrial spreading cases. Future work will be required to address the association between spreading and its occurrence on some of the largest landslides on Earth, its development mechanism, and its potential hazard implications. ]"

Implications for Cretaceous and younger source-to-sink systems in the Mexican foreland basins and the Gulf of Mexico ],"[ An extensive dataset of existing and new geo/thermochronological data from several areas in Southern Mexico constrains the tectonic history of the region, as well as various source-to-sink relationships and local burial histories. Our interpretation acknowledges that not all cooling/heating observed in the source areas is due to erosional exhumation/burial but, in some cases, due to advective heat transfer from magmatic sources, which potentially overprinted earlier events. In this work, we identified several areas that have been exhumed since the Early Cretaceous and potentially provided clastic material to the southern Gulf of Mexico area. We help to document how the Mexican (Laramide) Orogeny propagated eastwards and southwards from the Late Cretaceous through the early Oligocene . The first sediments reaching the Tampico–Misantla and Veracruz basins derived mostly from eroded Cretaceous carbonate material that covered the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Sierra de Juárez Complex and the Cuicateco belts, as well as foredeep/intra-orogenic basin deposits formerly covering them. Possibly by the end of the Mexican Orogeny , the clastic Jurassic and older crystalline basement rocks became exposed and became the main sources of quartz-rich clastic material to the most easterly foreland basins and Gulf of Mexico . Exposure was probably assisted by higher angle basement thrusts such as the Vista Hermosa/Valle Nacional faults. The Mixtequita and Guichicovi blocks have also provided an important source of quartz-rich and metamorphic lithic-rich material to the southern Veracruz Basin possibly since the Eocene . For most of the Cenozoic, the Chiapas and the Sureste basins were sourced from areas south of the Chiapas Massif , i.e., the North America–Caribbean plate boundary zone along today's Chiapas coastal plain. This plate boundary zone accommodated relative displacement between Mexico and the Chortis Block of the Caribbean Plate . Paleocene–middle Miocene sediments within the Chiapas Basin were at least partially sourced from i) metamorphic complexes in the northern Chortis Block; ii) the parautochthonous Chontal Complex, an oceanic-like basin sandwiched between Chortis and southern Mexico; iii) the elongating volcanic arc along southern Mexico and western Chortis; and iv) the Cretaceous and Jurassic sedimentary cover of the southern flank of the Chiapas Massif , The westward telescoping of southern Mexico onto the Cocos Plate in the wake of Chortis has produced flat slab subduction geometry and eastwardly-younging uplift of the Xolapa Belt (Oligo–Miocene) and the Chiapas Massif (late Miocene). It also caused reorganization of the drainage systems providing material to the Chiapas and Sureste basins. Our results highlight the importance of understanding relative block and plate boundary displacements in a dynamic hinterland and consider the role of major faults when interpreting source-to-sink relationships in the area. We describe the latter relationships for several geologic time intervals in which reservoir-prone sediments were delivered to the southern Gulf of Mexico. Finally, we integrate the source-to-sink history to provide an assessment of reservoir quality and hydrocarbon prospectivity in the region. ]"

PE spanned eight orders of magnitude (0.015 μg CH 4 m −2 h −1 –300 mg CH 4 m −2 h −1 ) while AE spanned seven (0.078–19044 g CH 4 m −2 yr −1 ). PE and AE were strongly related worldwide ( r 2 = 0.93). There was no relationship between AE and latitude, with highly variable PE across latitudes and climates. The coefficient of variation (CV) was greatest for emissions in oceans and estuaries, while the highest emission rate was recorded in wetlands and lakes. Efflux from coastal areas and estuaries was higher than that from upwelling areas and deep seas. Concerning wetland types, marshes showed the highest PE with the highest wetland emissions occurring in sites dominated by big helophytes. Non-stratifying- and eutrophic lakes displayed more emissions than other lake types, but there was no environmental variable that might predict methane emissions from lakes on a worldwide basis. Generally, most ecosystem types followed a seasonal pattern of emissions, with a maximum in summer, except in estuaries which did not show any distinct pattern. Regarding the importance of hot spots within most ecosystems, more spatial variability of CH 4 emissions was observed in lakes than in wetlands and oceans; however, no relationship between emissions and spatial variability was found. A positive relationship, albeit weak, was found between methane flux and either temperature or irradiance in wetlands; a narrow range of both negative and positive values of the water table promoted CH 4 emissions. Previously, little was known about the factors controlling efflux from river and marine environments. Our study suggests that local conditions are important in controlling CH 4 emissions, because the variability explained by the more commonly studied abiotic factors is low worldwide. This precludes the use of these variables to develop models to predict emissions at regional scales or wider, despite the many attempts made in the past. This makes local assessments of emissions essential, particularly in warm, temperate and tropical areas of the world. Future research aiming to shed light on CH 4 fluxes from estuaries, lakes, oceans, rivers and wetlands must: 1) produce more detailed data on controlling factors; 2) increase efforts to fully characterize spatial and temporal heterogeneity; 3) combine bottom-up (measurements) and top-down (modelling) approaches. ]"

Restrictive physical factors, such as heavy swell and wave turbulence in the breaker area, have undoubtedly limited in situ measurements and may partly account for the apparent poor correlation between field data and laboratory results and theoretical prediction. The development of sophisticated field instrumentation is an attempt to resolve this problem and this Review draws attention to some of the more recent techniques that have been reported in the extensive literature during the last decade or so. For the purpose of this paper, the nearshore zone is sub-divided into swash, surf/breaker and offshore zones. A summary is given of littoral transport rates, particularly with regard to the value of tracer experiments and models, and the difficulty of measuring surge-swash velocities and bottom profiles is assessed. Brief mention is made of swash percolation and groundwater flow and, bearing in mind the engineering problem of arresting the loss of beach sand to the backshore and dune system of some coastlines, the shear stress of sea breeze has also been evaluated. The problems of predicting changes in the plan shape of beaches and in the rate of mobility of shingle under wave action are discussed. Methods for measuring suspended sediment and bulk density are also described. Variations in wave refraction and wave energy relative to theoretical computation are appraised and reference is made to the use of radar in hydrodynamic surveying. Other sections of the review refer to the relationship that appears to exist between edge waves and crescentic bars; and the use of photography in studying coastal processes. ]"

Further research is called for to understand mixed-phase transport, deposition and retention or bromine in snowpack. Multiple bromine records from across Antarctica are required to evaluate their reliability reconstructing sea-ice extent. , As the intricacies of paleoclimate dynamics are explored, it is becoming understood that sea-ice variability can instigate, or contribute to, climate change instabilities commonly described as “tipping points”. Compared to ice sheets and circulating ocean currents, sea-ice is ephemeral and continental-scale changes to sea ice cover occur seasonally. Sea-ice greatly influences polar albedo , atmosphere-ocean gas exchange and vertical mixing of polar ocean masses. Major changes in sea ice distribution and thickness have been invoked as drivers of deglaciations as well as stadial climate variability described in Greenland climate records as “Dansgaard-Oeschger” cycles and described in Antarctic climate records as “Antarctic Isotopic Maxima”. The role of halogens in polar atmospheric chemistry has been studied intensively over the past few decades. This research has been driven by the role of bromine, primarily as gas-phase bromine monoxide (BrO), which exerts a key control on polar tropospheric ozone concentrations. Initial findings led to the discovery of boundary-layer self-catalyzing heterogeneous bromine reactions fed by sunlight and ozone, known as bromine explosions. First-year sea-ice and blowing snow have been identified as key components for this heterogeneous bromine recycling in the polar boundary layer. This understanding of polar halogen chemistry – supported by an expanding body of observations and modeling – has formed the basis for investigating quantitative links between halogen concentrations in the polar atmospheric boundary layer and sea-ice presence and/or extent. Despite the clear importance of sea-ice in paleoclimate research, the ice core community lacks a conservative and quantitative proxy for sea-ice extent. The most commonly applied proxy, methanesulphonic acid (MSA), is volatile and has not been demonstrated reliably for ice core records extending beyond the last few centuries. Sodium has also been applied to reconstruct sea-ice extent in a semi-quantitative manner although the effects of meteorological transport noise are significant. Contrary to a priori expectations, the halogens bromine and iodine appear to be stable in polar snow and ice over millennial timescales, addressing the temporal limitations of MSA records. Unfortunately, transport and meteorological variability influence sodium deposition as well as the deposition of halogens and the many other ionic impurities found in ice cores. The atmospheric chemistry of halogens is more complex than those of sodium or MSA due to the mixed-phase (gas and aerosol) nature of halogen photochemistry . Thus the application of halogen records in ice cores to sea-ice reconstruction overcomes some challenges posed by existing proxies, but also opens new challenges specific to halogens. Challenges common to all sea-ice proxies include the deconvolution of changes in emission source locations and changes in transport efficacy, particularly those occurring during climate transitions combining changes in sea-ice and atmospheric circulation , such as stadial/interstadial or glacial/interglacial climate variability. In this review, we describe the rationale and available evidence for linking the halogens bromine and iodine found in polar snow and ice to sea-ice extent. Reported measurements of bromine and iodine in polar snow and ice samples are critically discussed. We also consider aspects of halogen transport and retention in polar snow and ice that are still poorly understood. Overall, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the application of bromine to sea-ice reconstructions, and the use of iodine to reconstruct marine biological activity mediated in part by sea-ice extent. These halogens complement existing sea-ice proxies but most crucially, offer the capacity to greatly extend the temporal and spatial coverage of ice core-based sea-ice reconstructions. We identify knowledge gaps existing in the current understanding of spatial and temporal variability of halogen distributions in the polar regions . We suggest areas where polar halogen chemistry can contribute to a better understanding of the halogen records recovered from ice cores. Finally, we propose future steps for establishing reliable and constructive sea-ice reconstructions based on bromine and iodine as observed in snow and ice cores. ]"

IOCGs and Manto-type deposits constitute the second source of copper in Chile, after porphyry Cu-Mo systems, whereas IOAs are an important source of iron. Regardless of their economic importance, little is known about their formation and contrasting genetic models have been proposed i.e., an origin from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids exsolved from a cooling intrusion, or formation from non-magmatic basinal brines heated by plutonic bodies. Here we report Re-Os data for five IOCG deposits: Candelaria, Mantoverde, Casualidad, Diego de Almagro, and Barreal Seco, three IOAs: Los Colorados, El Romeral, and Carmen, and two Manto-type deposits: Altamira and Franke. Calculated Re-Os ages for some of these deposits are consistent with previously published geochronological data, and indicate an Early to Late Cretaceous age. The calculated ages for the Altamira Manto-type Cu deposit yield a ~ 90 Ma age, indicating that the Cretaceous Manto-type Cu belt of central Chile extends further north than previously thought. Additionally, the calculated initial Os ratios using reported ages show that IOCGs have a more radiogenic signature (2.0–2.4) than IOAs (1.0–1.2) and Manto-type Cu deposits (~ 1.1). A comparison with previously published Os initial ratios for the Mantoverde (0.2) and Candelaria (~ 0.4) IOCGs suggests that the mineralization in Chilean IOCGs is the result of different events with metals derived from diverse sources i.e., the magmatic-hydrothermal system and basement/host rocks. Rhenium and Os concentrations for the various studied deposits vary over a wide range of values at the ppb and ppt levels, respectively, with many sulfides and magnetite bearing appreciable no common Os. The Re and Os contents in sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite) from IOCGs are low, ranging from 2 to 149 ppb Re and up to 49 ppt Os. Pyrite from IOA deposits shows Re and Os concentrations ranging from 10.8 to 214 ppb Re, and Os &lt; 156 ppt, whereas magnetite has lower Re and Os contents (0.7–129 ppb Re, 0.2–3.6 ppt Os). However, rhenium and Os concentrations in magnetite might be attributed to small sulfide inclusions. Chalcocite from Manto-type Cu deposits shows the widest range and highest Re and Os concentrations; 15 to 253 ppb and 34 to 639 ppt, respectively. The Os present in all these deposits is dominated by radiogenic 187 Os. A comparison of Re and Os data from different deposit types, shows that Andean IOCG and IOA deposits have similar characteristics to Chilean porphyry Cu-Mo systems with low to moderate Re content (&lt; 250 ppb), low Os concentration (&lt; 300 ppt total Os) dominated by radiogenic Os (&gt; 90%Os r ), and variable initial Os ratios. Our data supports the idea that Andean IOCG and IOA deposits formed by magmatic-hydrothermal processes with little involvement of basinal brines. In contrast, published Re-Os information from IOCGs in China and Australia argues for the involvement of a much more radiogenic crustal source possibly related to non-magmatic oxidized saline brines that leached basement rocks. We conclude that Andean IOCG (and IOA) deposits in northern Chile were formed mainly by magmatic-hydrothermal processes related to the formation and emplacement of plutonic rocks with moderate contribution from leaching of basement and/or volcanic host rocks. Surface or basin-derived brines as well as sediments appear to play only a minor role in the formation of the Chilean IOCG clan. ]"

The record of fluvial overbank sedimentation dates back as far as the Mesoarchean, and mature assemblages of floodplain landforms had already developed at least by the early Palaeoproterozoic. In this review, a critical assessment of pre-vegetation floodplain processes and deposits is carried out through literature compilation and detailed descriptions of case studies. Pre-vegetation floodplains were variably composed of floodbasins, splay complexes (including crevasse- and distributary-channel fills and related splay lobes) and, in minor proportion, by channel levees. The hydrology of ancient floodbasin environments, mainly inferred from the occurrence or lack of evaporite features, is particularly topical and, once critically tested against other palaeo-environmental indicators, can be related to climate or catchment physiography. Pre-Silurian floodplains preferentially developed in rift basins prone to restricted drainage, where low-gradient axial depressions experienced limited stream power and accumulation of cohesive fines. Since supercontinents prone to host mature intracratonic basins first appeared in the Palaeoproterozoic, a causal relationship is established between the rise of modern-style plate tectonics and fluvial floodplains. By comparison, pre-vegetation overbank records are sparse in foreland, syn-orogenic, or passive-margin basins, where higher gradients and ocean-ward bypass of cohesive fines would have enhanced reworking by adjacent channels. These features are analogue to modern non-vegetated floodplains, with examples drawn from both arid endorheic drainages (Death Valley, California; Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia), and humid exorheic drainages (coastal plains of southern Iceland). Future developments in pre-Silurian sedimentology will help addressing lingering questions related to, for instance, the biogeomorphology of microbial mats and the morphogenetic variability between floodplains developed in different latitudinal climate belts. ]"

Proportion of females is related to extent that females are larger than males. Growth, size and numbers of females of estuarine species far exceed those of males. Growth is main factor contributing to marked differences in sex ratios. Spawning periods of species overlap, but occur latest in estuarine residents. , This review provides a composite account of the biological characteristics of the temperate gonochoristic species of the Platycephalidae. Initially, data were obtained for the five abundant platycephalid species in south-western Australia, which each came from either over bare substrata or seagrass and from either estuaries , marine coastal waters or marine embayments. The von Bertalanffy growth curves for females and males of each species differed significantly, with females having a greater TL ∞ and lower growth coefficient k . From tests using their upper deciles, the total length (TL) attained by the largest females of each species was significantly greater than that of their males, whereas such a trend did not occur with age. The ratio of females to males in each abundant age class, and overall, exceeded parity for four of the five species (typically P &lt; 0.001) and increased with increasing TL. Mortality estimates, which were similar for each sex of each species, suggest that Platycephalus speculator has been substantially exploited in a seasonally-closed estuary in which it completes its whole life cycle. The above and other biological data for the five species were collated with those published previously for two of those species and five other platycephalid species in south-eastern Australia and one in Japan and another in the Suez Canal, yielding the following conclusions for gonochoristic species of the Platycephalidae. Females attain a larger size than males, the extent varying markedly among species, whereas the longevities of the two sexes of each platycephalid species are similar. The maximum TLs and ages of the various species range widely, with values for females, for example, extending from 221 mm for Ambiserrula jugosa to 985 mm for Platycephalus fuscus and from four years for A. jugosa to 26 years for Platycephalus conatus . The overall ratio of females to males is positively related to the extent to which both the maximum TLs and TL ∞ s of the females exceed those of males. The above trends imply that growth, rather than differences in longevity and/or mortality, is the main factor contributing to the marked differences in sex ratios, which ranged widely from parity to 3.2:1. As the length at maturity, but not typically age at maturity, was greater for females than males, maturity is also related mainly to growth. The spawning periods of the various species overlapped, commencing as early as late winter/early spring, as temperatures started rising with four species and later in late spring/early summer with the three species found in estuaries, which would be advantageous as spawning in estuaries would occur when environmental conditions are most favourable for spawning success and larval retention. ]"

Ice has advanced south into western Washington at least six times, but the marine-isotope record suggests that these are but a fraction of the total that entered the region in the past 2.5 million years. Reconstruction of the Puget lobe of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the last glacial maximum requires basal sliding at the rates of several hundred meters per year, with pore-water pressures nearly that of the ice overburden.

Given the increasing attention on the application of ML methods to Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA), this review mapped out the state of art and potential of these methods to this field of research. Scientometric and systematic analysis were jointly applied providing an in-depth review of publications across the 2000–2020 timeframe. The resulting output from the analysis showed that a huge variety of ML algorithms have been already applied within CCRA, among them, the most recurrent are Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network . These algorithms are often applied in an ensemble or hybridized way to analyze most of all floods and landslides risk events. Moreover, the application of ML to deal with remote sensing data is consistent and effective across reviewed CCRA applications, allowing the identification and classification of targets and the detection of environmental and structural features. On the contrary concerning future climate change scenarios, literature seems not to be very widespread into scientific production, compared to studies evaluating risks under current conditions. The same lack can be noted also for the assessment of cascading and compound hazards and risks, since these concepts are recently emerging in CCRA literature but not yet in combination with ML-based applications. ]"

Several international agencies have already highlighted the extent of disaster-induced migration and called for interventions. Though these agencies present a broad perspective, either at international, national, or regional level, the status of existing empirical studies on migration induced by specific disaster events is somewhat unknown. Hence, this paper reviews the existing empirical literature on disaster-induced migration with a special emphasis on the spatio-temporal variability in migration types and patterns in response to both slow onset and rapid onset disasters. Using the Web of Science database, PRISMA framework is followed to select 43 research articles to conduct bibliometric analysis and systematic review. The review findings demonstrate a prevalence of studies on migration due to rapid onset disasters like flood, landslides and earthquakes compared to slow onset disasters like droughts. Also, migration from rural areas to urban areas are found to be the most common spatial pattern of migration irrespective of the type of disaster. The existing studies are found to concentrate on the economic drivers that induced disaster-induced migration with very less or no focus on other social or political drivers or an interplay of drivers that may lead to migration. The review demonstrates that apart from considering migration as an adaptation strategy, it is important to conduct more extensive studies on the dynamics, types and patterns, and interaction mechanism of different drivers of migration for future disaster preparedness . ]"

Due to the growing global population and urbanization, these soils are increasingly used to provide food, feed, fiber, energy, and other services to our society. In this paper, we summarize some recent studies on sandy soils and review the main soil and environmental issues related to the understanding, use, and management. We classify the soil issues into three categories: 1) physical and hydrological, 2) chemical and agronomical, and 3) biological and ecological issues. Recent advances include developing models and methods characterizing soil water repellency, preferential flows , transport of nutrients, agrochemicals and industrial contaminants, and groundwater contamination , soil compaction, erosion and evapotranspiration , improving soil fertility , structure, and biodiversity, monitoring, mapping, and managing salinity , sodicity , carbon sequestration , nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emission , and heavy metal contamination. The main challenges are to understand changes in sandy soil conditions (e.g. soil water repellency, soil compaction, crust, erosion, salinization , structure, fertility, inorganic and organic contamination) and processes (e.g. evapotranspiration , carbon sequestration , nutrients leaching and cycling, greenhouse gas emission) under intensive agricultural activities and climate change and evaluate the impacts of soil texture on soil properties and processes. A conceptual framework is proposed for holistic understanding and management of sandy soils under changing climate conditions and agricultural activities. ]"

A fisheries management framework is proposed to mitigate the overexploitation trend. , The dog snapper, Lutjanus jocu , is a commercially exploited fish throughout the Brazilian Province (BP) and has been facing overexploitation . However, there are no systematized data on the species to date, which hinders management strategies for mitigating this scenario. In this review, we gathered the existing literature information on L. jocu along the BP, focusing on distributional records, ecology, fisheries and conservation. A total of 253 records were attained in 212 studies, with the highest number found on the northeastern Brazilian coast. The species occurred in a multitude of habitats, such as estuaries , tidepools and reef systems, and was caught by a variety of fishing gear. We evidenced that ecological and fishery information on L. jocu is geographically biased in the BP, being prevalent on the northeastern coast and scarce or even absent in all other regions. To guide a L. jocu fisheries management in the BP, we propose a low-cost framework containing three major initiatives: i) participatory mapping of fishing and aggregation grounds, ii) slot size limit regulation backed by eco-labeling, and iii) citizen science-based monitoring. Efforts to establish dog snapper fisheries management and monitoring should be urgently implemented to avoid the collapse of the stock in the BP. ]"

Although there is general agreement about the regional scale geology of Taiwan, there are considerable differences in the structural interpretations of its western fold-and-thrust belt. In this paper, we bring together results of our previous studies and add new data and data analyses to develop a consistent 3D structural model for the south-central Taiwan fold-and-thrust belt that can explain key aspects of the seismicity , GPS , and topography data. We interpret the fold-and-thrust belt to be a west-verging, imbricate thrust system developed above a single basal thrust that is breached by ENE-striking faults that are inherited from the continental margin . These breaching faults are associated with ENE-striking transverse zones in the fold-and-thrust belt that are marked by changes in stratigraphy, structural style, strike and dip of the basal thrust, and uplift of the stratigraphic contacts. Along the eastern flank of the fold-and-thrust belt, metamorphic basement rocks are involved in the thrusting. Shortening estimates range from 15 km to &gt;25 km. Much of the seismicity is taking place beneath the basal thrust, in the basement, along the flanks of basement highs and lows where strike-slip and transpressive fault types are common. There are systematic changes in GPS displacement vectors and strain rates across the transverse zones. Topography is higher in areas where basement is involved in the thrusting. The proposed structural model has depth and along-strike consistency, and can explain aspects of the distribution of seismicity, faults types, GPS displacement vectors and strain rates, and topography of the study area, and can therefore be considered a viable model. ]"

Pesticides continue to be detected in waterways of the Great Barrier Reef at above national guideline values on a regular basis. , Pesticide residues are found ubiquitously in Queensland east coast and Great Barrier Reef (GBR) waterbodies. The highest concentrations, often above Australian guidelines, are found adjacent to and downstream of areas of intensive cropping, largely sugarcane cultivation and horticulture . Due to the iconic status of the GBR more information on pesticide levels, risk to ecosystems and management solutions are available than in other parts of Australia. Freshwater bodies being, in general, closer to the source of pesticide residues from intensive agriculture, have higher concentrations present than waterbodies further away from the agriculture e.g. estuarine and marine environments. As such pesticide residues present a higher risk in these waterbodies with a lowering of risk as ecosystems become further distant from the sources. Management of pesticides in Australia is a joint responsibility of the Australian and State governments. Management for environmental protection at the Australian level by the regulator, the Australian Pesticide and Veterinary Medicine Authority, has serious deficiencies in process and practice. However at the Queensland Government level action is being taken to reduce pesticide pollution of waterways, including research, monitoring, risk assessments and application of better pesticide application methods. However only limited progress is being made in reducing pesticide exposure. Given the large knowledge base of pesticide management methods available there is some hope that residue levels and risk to ecosystems can be reduced. ]"

Spectrally neutrality and spatial invariance of SPR were first incorporated to choose the best retrievals. The derived fine-mode AOD has a high spatial resolution and wide coverage. Comparison and validation with POLDER and AERONET products show a good agreement and a high accuracy. Fine-mode AOD retrieved from DPC proves the applicability of this algorithm. , The fine-mode aerosols (FMA), generally generated from anthropogenic sources , play an essential role in global radiation balance, climate change, atmospheric environment, and human health. However, the FMA retrieval remains a challenge. An improved high resolution FMA retrieval algorithm based on the Spectral Neutrality of Surface Polarized Reflectance (SNOSPR) was developed using polarized satellite data. SNOSPR utilizes a lookup table approach to simultaneously retrieve high spatial resolution FMA parameters, such as FMA optical depth (AOD f ), Ångström exponent (AE), and surface polarized reflectance (SPR), without using the surface Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Function (BPDF) model, which may yield relatively more significant errors of SPR estimation in certain surface types. Besides, a new cost function (CF) based on the hypothesis of invariance of SPR was used to select the best retrievals. SNOSPR algorithm was applied to POLDER-3 polarized observation data (i.e., 2010–2012). Inter-comparison between SNOSPR (6 km ) and POLDER-3 (L2_LGC,18 km ) for two typical cases and monthly averaged AOD f products showed a generally consistent spatial distribution, while SNOSPR provided more details, and better coverage over barren and coastal areas at high spatial resolution. Furthermore, all retrieved AOD f , AE products of SNOSPR and L2_LGC were validated using AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurements. The AOD f results showed fine correlation coefficients , i.e., R of 0.9 and 0.89, respectively. However, products of SNOSPR had the expected error range which was higher than that of L2_LGC over all surface types (i.e., 77.3% vs 70.6%), urban (i.e., 76.0% vs 60.6%) and wetland (i.e., 82.4% vs 68.4%). Time-series comparison over grassland showed that SNOSPR had better coverage and more accurate retrievals. Considering AE, both SNOSPR and L2_LGC underestimated its value when validated against AERONET measurements. On the other hand, SPR was retrieved at higher retrieval accuracy by SNOSPR than L2_LGC, which used BPDF. Accuracies of the retrieved AOD f improved significantly when multi-directional data was used, especially when the viewing angle number increased from one to four. The uncertainty analysis of spectral neutrality and spatial invariance of SPR was discussed for future improvements of SNOSPR. Last, SNOSPR was applied on Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC), i.e., a POLDER-like sensor onboard the Chinese Gao Fen-5 satellite. The results in this study demonstrated the effectiveness of the SNOSPR algorithm and its potential for more reliable AOD f /SPR retrievals for monitoring local atmospheric pollution and related studies. ]"

Future work on Synechococcus is suggested from a marine ecological perspective. , Marine Synechococcus , a main group of picocyanobacteria, has been ubiquitously observed across the global oceans. Synechococcus exhibits high phylogenetical and phenotypical diversity, and horizontal gene transfer makes its genetic evolution much more intricate. With the development of measurement technologies and analysis methods, the genomic information and niche partition of each Synechococcus lineage tend to be precisely described, but the global analysis is still lacking. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize existing studies and integrate published data to gain a comprehensive understanding of Synechococcus on genetic variation , niche division, and potential functions. In this review, the maximum likelihood trees are constructed based on existing sequence data, including both phylogenetic and pigmentary gene markers. The global distribution characteristics of abundance, lineages, and pigment types are concluded through pooled analysis of more than 700 samples obtained from approximately 50 scientific research cruises. The potential functions of Synechococcus are explored in element cycles and biological interactions. Future work on Synechococcus is suggested to focus on not only elucidating the nature of Synechococcus biodiversity but also demonstrating its interactions with the ecosystem by combining bioinformatics and macroscopic isotope-labeled environmental parameters. ]"

In this paper, the recovery of the dune of Vougot Beach is analysed through a survey of morphological changes and hydrodynamic conditions. Data collection focused on the period immediately following storm Johanna until July 2010, i.e. over two and a half years. Results showed that the dune retreated by a maximum of almost 6 m where storm surge and wave attack were the most energetic. Dune retreat led to the creation of accommodation space for the storage of sediment by widening and elevating space between the pre- and post-storm dune toe, and reducing impacts of the storm surge. Dune recovery started in the month following the storm event and is still ongoing. It is characterised by the construction of “secondary” embryo dunes, which recovered at an average rate of 4–4.5 cm per month, although average monthly volume changes varied from − 1 to 2 m 3 .m − 1 . These embryo dunes accreted due to a large aeolian sand supply from the upper tidal beach to the existing foredune. These dune-construction processes were facilitated by growth of vegetation on low-profile embryo dunes promoting backshore accretion. After more than two years of survey, the sediment budget of the beach/dune system showed that more than 10,000 m 3 has been lost by the upper tidal beach. We suggest that seaward return currents generated during the storm of 10th March 2008 are responsible for offshore sediment transport. Reconstitution of the equilibrium beach profile following the storm event may therefore have generated cross-shore sediment redistribution inducing net erosion in the tidal zone. ]"

With increasing availability and accessibility, multi-temporal ALS data have been used to advance key research topics related to dynamic Earth surface processes. This review presents a comprehensive compilation of existing applications of ALS change detection to the Earth sciences. We cover a wide scope of material pertinent to the broad field of Earth sciences to encourage the cross-pollination between sub-disciplines and discuss the outlook of ALS change detection for advancing scientific discovery. While significant progress has been made in applying repeat ALS data to change detection, numerous approaches make fundamental assumptions that limit the full potential of repeat ALS data. The use of such data for 3D change detection is, therefore, in need of novel, scalable, and computationally efficient processing algorithms that transcend the ever-increasing data density and spatial coverage. Quantification of uncertainty in change detection results also requires further attention, as it is vitally important to understand what 3D differences detected between epochs represent actual change as opposed to limitations in data or methodology. Although ALS has become increasingly integral to change detection across the Earth sciences, the existence of pre- and post-event ALS data is still uncommon for many isolated hazard events, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions , wildfires, and landslides. Consequently, data availability is still a major limitation for many ALS change detection applications. ]"

The enormous changes at a regional scale and advancements in technology have encouraged researchers to gather more information. The remote sensing technology and GIS tools cooperatively have made it easier to monitor the changes in land use land cover (LULC) from past to present. This technology has unraveled the changes at the regional and global level and has also contributed tremendous benefits to the scientific community. A variety of change detection algorithms have been used in the history of remote sensing to detect changes at earth's surface and newer techniques are still in process. The data from remote sensing satellites are the primary sources that provide an opportunity to acquire information about LULC change in recent decades, which extensively use different algorithms according to the research needs. The selection of appropriate change detection method is highly recommended in every remote sensing project. This review paper begins with the traditional pre and post-classification change detection techniques related to LULC information at the regional level. Therefore, this paper evaluated the mostly used change detection method among all others to find remarkable results. Thus the review concludes the post-classification change detection method using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) supervised classification is applicable in all cases. The comparative analysis was also performed in a selected region having multiple land features during review in which MLC results best in comparison to others.

Moorings with traps positioned at three depths were placed near the mouth and toward the head of each fjord, and deployments were monthly. We present fluxes of total mass, biogenic silica (BSi), particulate organic carbon (POC) and aluminium (Al), as well as the δ 13 C signal of the POC, and we compare the sediment-trap fluxes to primary-production measurements made during the experiment. Diatomaceous silica and aluminosilicates were the primary components of the settling flux, while organic matter from marine (largely diatoms) and terrestrial sources was occasionally a significant portion of the sinking material. Fluxes of BSi and POC were highest in the spring and summer, tracing maxima in local primary production. These fluxes decreased, increased or remained constant with depth due to water-column remineralisation and variability in processes that cause fluxes to increase with depth. Al fluxes followed local precipitation and river runoff at the landward stations, and with remarkable faithfulness in Saanich Inlet. Near the mouths, there was little seasonality in Al flux, and the increases of flux with depth reveal sedimentary plumes at each fjord’s sill. Tidal and deepwater-renewal components of the plumes are evident, and the plume in Saanich Inlet was particularly intense. Fluxes of Al to deep sediment traps associated with renewal flows were also observed toward the head of each fjord. Marine δ 13 C endmembers are estimated from relationships between δ 13 C and BSi concentrations, and measures of soil δ 13 C from each fjord were available. These endmembers are used with the δ 13 C record to quantify marine and terrigenous contributions to the POC flux. Marine POC composed 54–72% of the total POC caught by shallow sediment traps in spring and summer, and 36–54% in fall and winter. Primary production and sediment-trap fluxes are used to estimate annually averaged export ratios (shallow-trap flux:autotrophic assimilation) for marine POC and Si. POC export ratios (0.092–0.14) were low for these productive waters, but they compare with other results based on sediment-trap fluxes from coastal waters where terrigenous OC has been subtracted. Export ratios of Si were calculated using an estimated Si:C assimilation ratio and, therefore, are susceptible to error, but the high results (&gt;0.8) suggest that BSi was exported more efficiently than POC. The possibility that POC was preferentially lost after interception by sediment traps is also considered. Primary production and settling fluxes were higher in Saanich Inlet than in Jervis Inlet, while export ratios of OC and Si were similar in both fjords, away from the nepheloid layer near the sill of Saanich Inlet. ]"

These calculations are complemented by a simpler, in essence time-independent model, which is used to examine the sensitivity of the sediment distribution over the slope (from a shelf-break source) to changes in the specified values of horizontal and vertical diffusion coefficients. The philosophy of the paper is to use idealized tidal, wind and wind wave forcing to examine changes in sediment distribution resulting from these processes. Calculations with the time-dependent and steady state models give insight into both the role of events and long-term effects. The steady state model focuses on the off-shelf region, whilst the time-dependent model considers on-shelf events. Tidal calculations showed that for the stratification used here the internal tide in the OMEX region was primarily confined to the shelf edge and ocean. A mean on-shelf sediment transport in the surface layer and off-shelf transport at the bed was found. Across-shelf circulations produced by up-welling/down-welling favourable winds gave rise to on-shelf/off-shelf currents in the bottom boundary layer with an opposite flow in the surface layer. In the case of an up-welling favourable wind, sediment suspension was at a maximum in the near coastal region, with sediment being advected off shore in the surface layer. With a down-welling favourable wind, surface sediment was advected towards the shore, but there was offshore transport at the bed. Near the shelf edge any upwelling flow had the tendency to return this sediment to the surface layer from whence it was transported on-shore. So in essence the sediment was trapped within an on-shelf circulation cell. Wind waves effects increased the total bed stress and hence the sediment concentration and its transport, although its pattern was determined by tidal and wind forcing. The time independent model with increased/decreased lateral diffusivity gave an enhanced/reduced horizontal sediment distribution for a given settling velocity. As the settling velocity increases, the down-slope movement of sediment is increased, with a reduction in the thickness of the near-bed sediment layer, but with little change in its horizontal extent. ]"

The exploited aquifer contained in El Diablo Fm (Miocene alluvial filling) covers almost 6420 km 2 , i.e. +87% compared to a previous study.

This has important (and often unacknowledged) implications for adjacent shoreline form and behaviour both now and in the near-future. The shoreface has been relatively little studied from a mesoscale morphodynamic (morphological change over time) perspective and various definitions exist regarding its extent and morphodynamic subdivisions. To overcome the diversity and ambiguity of existing definitions we propose a standard terminology involving the external limits and subordinate zones of the shoreface. In our definition, the landward limit of the shoreface coincides with the seaward limit of the fair weather surf zone , and where no surf zone is present, the base of the beachface. The shoreface itself is subdivided into upper and lower shorefaces, separated by the depth of closure (DoC) as defined by Hallermeier (1981) . The seaward limit of the lower shoreface is defined by the limit of significant sediment transport , indicated by bed shear stress according to Valiente et al. (2019) . All boundaries are temporally variable according to wave characteristics and timescale of study. The upper shoreface is dynamic at seasonal to annual timescales and interacts with the adjacent surfzone via wave transformation and two-way sediment exchange. The lower shoreface is dynamic at decadal to millennial timescales and it interacts with the adjacent upper shoreface and inner shelf. The upper shoreface is strongly influenced by wave hydrodynamics whereas the lower shoreface is less dynamic and its shape is more heavily influenced by geological factors (nature and/or abundance of sediment, depth and erodibility of rock outcrop, etc.). Sediment exchange both within the shoreface and between shoreface and adjacent environments is strongly event-driven. Longshore, onshore and offshore transport mechanisms have been documented. The shoreface profile influences, and is influenced by, wave transformation, however, the widely adopted shoreface equilibrium profile is not universally applicable. Instead, a diversity of shoreface morphologies exists in two and three dimensions. These are likely related to sediment supply and accommodation and we propose a spectrum of shoreface types based on these variables. Recent studies have shown that large-scale 3-D forms (e.g. shoreface-connected ridges and sorted bedforms) strongly influence shoreline behaviour, however, the dynamics of these shoreface bedforms requires further investigation. Each type of shoreface likely exhibits distinctive behaviour at the mesoscale (time scale of 10 1 to 10 2 years and a spatial scale of 10 1 to 10 2 km). This is proposed as a unifying model with which to integrate studies of shoreface dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales. ]"

Studies reporting high denitrification rates in SCMs mostly used indirect assays. Direct denitrification measurements suggest temporary removal pathways may dominate in SCMs. Nitrogen cycling within SCMs should be measured using direct methods. Quantifying seasonal and spatial variability of SCM nitrogen cycling is critical. , Stormwater control measures (SCMs) have the potential to mitigate negative effects of watershed development on hydrology and water quality. Stormwater regulations and scientific literature have assumed that SCMs are important sites for denitrification , the permanent removal of nitrogen, but this assumption has been informed mainly by short-term loading studies and measurements of potential rates of nitrogen cycling. Recent research concluded that SCM nitrogen removal can be dominated by plant and soil assimilation rather than by denitrification, and rates of nitrogen fixation can exceed rates of denitrification in SCM sediments, resulting in a net addition of nitrogen. Nitrogen cycling measurements from other human-impacted aquatic habitats have presented similar results, additionally suggesting that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and algal uptake could be important processes for recycling nitrogen in SCMs. Future research should directly measure a suite of nitrogen cycling processes in SCMs and reveal controlling mechanisms of individual rate processes. There is ample opportunity for research on SCM nitrogen cycling, including investigations of seasonal variation, differences between climatic regions , and trade-offs between nitrogen removal and phosphorus removal. Understanding nitrogen dynamics within SCMs will inform more efficient SCM design and management that promotes denitrification to help mitigate negative effects of urban stormwater on downstream ecosystems. ]"

Hurst Castle Spit and the Shingles Bank then began to form due to a combination of an easterly littoral drift, offshore gravel movement due to the high tidal energy, a rising sea-level, the transgression of Hurst Beach due to overwashing and the formation of recurves due to waves in the West Solent. The growth of the Shingles Bank due to offshore sediment movement from Hurst Castle Spit was of particular importance because of its influence on the wave energy along Hurst Beach. Significant local supplies of shingle in the vicinity of Hurst Castle Spit, reworked from Quatenary deposits, were also of importance. Thus, it is not a classic multi-recurved spit and the transgressive segment, Hurst Beach, has much in common with barrier coastlines. The same processes are continuing to shape Hurst Castle Spit at present, with the additional effects of human interference in the coastal sediment system. The construction of sea defences at Milford-on-Sea in the period 1936 to 1968 has modified the sediment budget and Hurst Castle Spit is experiencing a phase of rapid evolution: maximum recession rates have increased from 1.5m a −1 (1867–1968) to 3.5m a −1 (1968–1982). It is difficult to quantify the exact role of sea-level rise in the present evolution of Hurst Castle Spit. The future evolution of Hurst Castle Spit will depend largely on man. If there is no further interference, which is highly unlikely, the beach volume will continue to decline, resulting in a further increase in the rate of recession. Ultimately, a true tidal breach will probably form, marking a new phase in the evolution of Hurst Castle Spit and its environs. However, shingle renourishment, or another coastal engineering solution will probably be undertaken. The future rate of sea-level rise will have important long-term influences on all these options. ]"

The coastal boulder fields of the Ryukyu Islands, Japan are one of the few places where comparisons can be made between the distribution and characteristics of boulders deposited by a known historical tsunami and storm waves. The 1771 Meiwa Tsunami struck the southern Ryukyu Islands (Miyako–Yaeyama Islands) and reliable historical documents describe run-up heights of up to 30 m. The displacement of specific boulders by the tsunami is also described in detail. Some of the islands away from the Miyako–Yaeyama Islands were unaffected by this tsunami, but they have been extensively affected by typhoon-generated storm waves. On these islands, the boulders were commonly deposited on the reef flat within 300 m of the reef edge as an exponentially fining landward deposit. This provides a useful indication of the transport limit for storm waves on the Ryukyu Islands. In the tsunami-affected islands, boulders of different types have been deposited both on the reef crest and along the shoreline . The reef crest boulders are identified as storm wave emplaced, whereas those along the shoreline are interpreted as tsunami boulders (“tsunami-ishi” in Japanese) because they are exceedingly heavy and are deposited well beyond (ca. 1.5 km from the reef edge) the transport limit for storm waves. Their 1771 Meiwa Tsunami origin is supported by 14 C age results, although prior tsunami(s) may have deposited some of the boulders. Based on these results, we infer that the difference between the wave periods of tsunami and storm waves is crucial to differentiating tsunami boulders from other enigmatic boulder deposits around the world. Differences in wave period are reflected in differences between the spatial and clast size distributions of boulder deposits. The distribution and sedimentary characteristics of tsunami boulders therefore provide useful data for estimating possible tsunami sources. The boulders on the Ryukyu Islands are also useful for differentiating between tsunami and storm wave emplacement and for estimating their hydrodynamic properties. ]"

These soils constitute a pedological unit named San Rafael Paleosol (SRP) which were developed during the late Pleistocene (MIS 2) to the middle Holocene (15,000–4500 cal years BP). These paleosols can use as a chronologic marker at a regional scale. In this paper, we present a pedogenic interpretation of the paleosol-sedimentary processes during the late Quaternary, which contributes to the reconstruction of regional paleoenvironment . The development of SRP takes place over more than 15,000 years, and this pedogenesis is interrupted by stages of strong climatic instability, causing erosion of the SRP and sedimentation, presumably during the Altithermal. The records of La Playa show that SRP is buried by fluvial sediments , which include different facies . These sedimentation events are associated with the end of the Altithermal period and evidence more active geomorphic processes . These conditions are also observed at El Gramal, where dune sediments overly the SRP. This discontinuity evidence an intense erosional/sedimentation phase. In the particular case of El Fin del Mundo site, it is observed more mesic conditions as the water table rose, creating a wetland. Much of the synchronous variation in the morphology of the paleosols (pedofacies) can be explained by differences in local geomorphological conditions. These palaoesols developed under a semi-arid climate, slightly more humid than the present one with winter dominant rains and marked seasonal changes. These assumptions are supported by soil micromorphology , physical characteristics (color, grain size distribution) and composition of total organic and inorganic carbon . Additional paleoenvironmental information is also extracted from microbiomorphic analyses and diatoms assemblages from the one profile at El Fin del Mundo site. ]"

Interaction between waves and river flow determines river-mouth bar formation. River-mouth bars are the building blocks of many wave-constructed delta shorelines. Longshore drift around the river mouth influences delta sediment loss or conservation. Weakened river influence will lead to the ultimate demise of many deltas by waves. , Waves are an important agent in the construction, shaping and destruction of river deltas. Notwithstanding the commonality of waves in oceans and seas, wave influence on deltas varies considerably depending on the coastal morphology and nearshore bathymetry . Although there have been advances in understanding the way waves approaching a delta shape its shoreline , much still remains to be known of the interactions between waves and river deltas. Deltas are built essentially from sediments supplied by rivers. Sand-sized and coarser sediments may also be derived from nearby abandoned delta lobes or from older relict nearshore deposits, transported by wave reworking and longshore currents. Alternatively, delta erosion by waves can also release sediment that is redistributed alongshore or that accumulates offshore. The extent to which bedload is supplied to and sequestered in, or lost by, deltas through waves and longshore transport strongly depends on interactions between waves and fluvial discharge at the river mouth. These interactions and the mutual adjustments they engender are not only important in the overall balance between delta retreat, progradation or aggradation but also in processes such as avulsion and channel switching, as well as in the eventual survival of a delta in the face of sea-level rise. Where waves are important, fluvial liquid discharge is high, and sediment supply is rich in bedload, two important aspects are the blocking of waves and longshore currents by strong river discharge and the formation of bars at the river mouth. Field studies of the complex interactive processes prevailing where river flows encounter waves are, however, non-existent and numerical modelling, though promising, hampered by scale constraints and the difficulty of replicating them and generating mouth bars in the presence of longshore currents. This interaction influences the seaward extent of the delta mouth protuberance and its stability; this protuberance then forming the regional shoreline template to which waves and longshore currents adjust. Longshore currents can redistribute wave-reworked mouth bar deposits emplaced during strong river flow. Transport may be either divergent from the mouth or may be regionally unidirectional but wherein the symmetry of some deltas, probably rare, may be maintained by a strong river blocking effect on transport from the updrift flank. The mouth protuberance may be such as to foster transport reversal (counter-drift) at the delta margins that contributes to sediment sequestering within the delta. These interactions largely contribute in shaping delta shorelines, and together with the abundance of sediment supply and grain size, determine the resultant wave-formed shoreline barrier types, which include spits, more or less closely-spaced beach ridges, and barrier islands and cheniers in situations of punctuated progradation or retreat. Where several distributary mouths occur, pronounced longshore variability in wave processes and wave-induced sediment transport may ensue, resulting in multiple drift cells that assure the retention of sand and coarse-grained sediments within the delta. Waves can also be an important agent in the reworking and retreat of mud-rich deltas that generally conform in morphology to the ‘river-dominated’ (such as the Mississippi) or ‘tide-dominated’ (such as the Ganges–Brahmaputra or Chao Phraya) types, resulting in the episodic formation of sandy cheniers and beach ridges. Although sea-level rise is likely to lead to enhanced wave reworking of deltas, the possible prevalence of aggradation (in lieu of progradation), channel switching and avulsion, and washover processes, may contribute to the disorganization of waves and longshore transport, fostering deltaic sequestering of sand and coarser-sized sediment and delta survival. The weakening of river discharges resulting from human activities will invariably lead, however, to enhanced wave reworking of deltas and to deltaic sediment redistribution by longshore currents. The massive swing towards significant reductions in fluvial sediment supply today may signify the ultimate demise of many deltas in the coming decades through a process of delta shoreline straightening by waves, in addition to accelerated sinking. These various foregoing aspects of the relationship between waves and river deltas are reviewed here across a range of timescales, and new interaction concepts proposed, using numerous examples of deltas in the world and on the basis of case studies, conceptual studies and numerical modelling studies in the literature spanning more than forty years. ]"

The integrated rate equation was first used to estimate fossil age from D/L but its geochronological utility is disadvantaged by uncertainties regarding the conformity of AAR in fossil protein to apparent reversible first-order kinetics for the entire reaction history. ‘Non-linear’ models have subsequently been used to relate D/L to t . The logarithmic equation successfully applied to Atlantic Coastal Plain research has not achieved widespread application, perhaps due to the regional calibration required if sensitivity to temperature is to be modelled, or the difficulties encountered when extending the model to include fossils with D/L&lt;0.1. Success producing a linear correlation between D/L transformed with a power function and t has seen this approach emerge as one of the most commonly applied in AAR geochronology in recent years. Like parabola curve fitting, which has been applied to trends in D/L versus t in a variety of fossils and geographic settings, power transformations may not be suitable for geochronological modelling during the latter stages of amino acid diagenesis. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of simple and contingent linear equations for relating D/L to t . Future research should aim to reduce reliance on independent calibration and explore the geochronological benefits of AAR in pools other than the total hydrolysable amino acids. ]"

From a geological perspective, mangroves come and go at considerable speed with the current distribution of forests a legacy of the Holocene, having undergone almost chronic disturbance as a result of fluctuations in sea-level. Mangroves have demonstrated considerable resilience over timescales commensurate with shoreline evolution. This notion is supported by evidence that soil accretion rates in mangrove forests are currently keeping pace with mean sea-level rise. Further support for their resilience comes from patterns of recovery from natural disturbances (storms, hurricanes) which coupled with key life history traits, suggest pioneer-phase characteristics. Stand composition and forest structure are the result of a complex interplay of physiological tolerances and competitive interactions leading to a mosaic of interrupted or arrested succession sequences, in response to physical/chemical gradients and landform changes. The extent to which some or all of these factors come into play depends on the frequency, intensity, size, and duration of the disturbance. Mangroves may in certain circumstances offer limited protection from tsunamis; some models using realistic forest variables suggest significant reduction in tsunami wave flow pressure for forests at least 100 m in width. The magnitude of energy absorption strongly depends on tree density, stem and root diameter, shore slope, bathymetry, spectral characteristics of incident waves, and tidal stage upon entering the forest. The ultimate disturbance, climate change, may lead to a maximum global loss of 10–15% of mangrove forest, but must be considered of secondary importance compared with current average annual rates of 1–2% deforestation. A large reservoir of below-ground nutrients, rapid rates of nutrient flux and microbial decomposition, complex and highly efficient biotic controls, self-design and redundancy of keystone species, and numerous feedbacks, all contribute to mangrove resilience to various types of disturbance. ]"

In a second paper, the results achieved with the present study are used as proxy for interpreting the analogue lower Pleistocene succession cropping out along the margins of the modern strait. The tide-dominated Messina Strait separates the Italian peninsula and Sicily in the central Mediterranean Sea. This 3-km-wide marine passageway is governed by bi-directional tidal currents flowing along the strait axis, because of semi-diurnal tidal phase opposition, so that high tide in the Ionian Sea corresponds with low tide in the Tyrrhenian Sea and vice versa. Tidal currents cyclically accelerate passing through the strait central restriction and decelerate towards the strait exits, following reverse directions during each tidal phase. This hydrodynamics generates specific by-pass areas, sediment routes and accumulation patterns in the modern strait, based upon the varying bed-shear stress exerted onto the strait bottom by the converging/diverging M2 tidal waves. Recent multibeam-based investigations on the modern Messina Strait bottom reveal subaqueous morpho-bathymetric features, which allow a number of areas with specific morphologic characters and sedimentary processes to be identified: (i) the ‘strait-centre zone’ is the narrowest and shallowest by-pass sector, where the tidal currents reach their maximum strength eroding and scouring the substrate. (ii) Towards NE and S, two larger ‘dune-bedded zones’ occur. Here, clastic sediments transported as bed load and in suspension are accumulated and continuously reworked forming characteristic bedform fields, whose features reflect complex current patterns due to a strong tidal asymmetry. (iii) The ‘strait-end zones’ represent distal depositional areas, where decelerating currents rework fine-grained smaller moribund dunes . (iv) The ‘strait-margin zones’ are diffusely characterised by mass-wasting processes along the steepest sublittoral sectors, where sediment instability are caused by earthquakes or sea storms. Fan-deltas prograde from the gentler-sloping coastal segments, represent the main sediment entry points with episodic, high-magnitude discharge and are influenced by the tidal circulation only along their delta-front parts. However, a dogmatic zone partition, based on a ‘mutually-evasive’ mechanism of sediment distribution and consequent decrease in the transport capacity towards the strait ends is not everywhere applicable to the Messina Strait sedimentary dynamics. The examination of measured tidal ellipses reveals that although flood and ebb tidal currents are approximately equal in speed, they are collinear only across the narrowest zone, being separated as the strait enlarges. This flow separation has possibly generated two main populations of flood and ebb bedforms, which migrate at high angle and with reverse direction in the two dune-bedded zones of the strait. Moreover, because of a strong water-mass stratification due to a marked difference in salinity , the denser flood constituent dominates over the lighter ebb current. As a consequence, the largest dunes observed in both the strait opposite depositional areas have northward-oriented lee faces, whereas superimposed smaller dunes have southward-oriented fronts, reflecting flood and ebb tidal constituents , respectively. Erosional features in the central sill, uncharacteristic bedforms having orientations not explained by modern currents and coarser grains in some places implying thresholds of motion larger than the modern currents all suggest that different, most likely, larger currents, probably occurred at some point in the past. It is suggested here that these features reflect an early stage of strait connection, during the initial sea-level rise after the Last Glacial Maximum . The data reviewed in the present work summarise the complex sedimentary dynamics of the modern Messina Strait and allow a comparative analysis of the ancient strait exposed along the modern margins, also suggesting insights for other examples of tidal straits developed under similar oceanographic conditions. ]"

NPF produces about half of the present-day cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), thus significantly influencing cloud properties and Earth's energy budget. But, observations of NPF are scarce globally, particularly in India. The first-ever evidence of NPF in India was reported in 2005. To the best of our knowledge, there are only 22 published papers to date based on independent field campaigns and long-term field observations in India. These studies reported the key characteristics of NPF, such as frequency of occurrence of NPF, particle formation rate, growth rate, and atmospheric conditions influencing NPF. Very little is known about the chemical mechanisms responsible for NPF in India because field observations using state-of-the-art instruments (e.g., CI-APi-TOF, EESI-TOF) are not available for real-time identification and quantification of gas-phase and particle-phase compounds in the air. Therefore, this review focuses on the observed characteristics of NPF in different environments and identifies critical knowledge gaps for future NPF studies in India. We recommend a measurement network of aerosol and precursor concentrations in different environments using the recently developed state-of-the-art instruments aided with regional model simulations, incorporated with the nucleation schemes based on the laboratory experiments (CLOUD), to interpret field measurements. ]"

Our appraisal of methodologies for studying inlet dynamics leads us to formulate a new approach for investigating inlet evolution and stability based on combining sediment budget computations (using best estimates and uncertainty analysis) and inlet hydraulic parameter analysis. The approach developed is applied to a stabilised inlet, located within a multi-inlet system (Faro-Olhão Inlet, Ria Formosa, Southern Portugal), which was opened starting 1929 and has since been dredged periodically to maintain navigability. A series of digital maps was produced based on multi-year data acquired from charts, surveys, and aerial photos. The maps were used to compute sediment volumes for six coastal cells delineated on the basis of the morphological features of the inlet. Cell volumes and fluxes were calculated for three periods (1929–1962, 1962–1978, and 1978–2001), and overall sediment budgets were calculated for the latter two periods. Inlet hydraulic parameters measured included tidal prism, inlet channel cross-sectional area and hydraulic radius, and maximum depth of the inlet throat, and were tracked over 9 bathymetric surveys from 1947–2004. The computed budget reveals that the inlet is only at present reaching volumetric equilibrium. However, the analysis of channel cross-sectional area and radius indicates parameter stability around 1978–1985, 20–25 years before the inlet started to reach volumetric equilibrium. It is hypothesised that the observed stability in parameters for the inlet post-1978 is related to the presence of fixed jetties and to a stratigraphic control that prevents further deepening, and not to the achievement of a dynamic equilibrium. The findings indicate that the coupling of sediment budget computation and inlet parameter analysis is useful for understanding historical sediment pathways and magnitudes, and for analysing the evolution of an inlet towards equilibrium. Although the analysis of inlet parameter evolution is valuable for examining the locational/geometrical stability of an inlet, it needs to be used in conjunction with sediment budget computations in order to properly infer inlet equilibrium. Moreover, existing formulae used to infer inlet stability, which relate cross-sectional area to tidal prism, should be reviewed with a view to including other external variables (e.g., stratigraphic controls) and to making their application more flexible to cope with the range of different inlet conditions. For multi-inlet systems, the coupling of morphology and hydrodynamics analysis should be extended to all inlets in order to infer the stability of the overall system based on the distribution of the tidal prism through time and the patterns of inlet circulation and sediment transport. ]"

The mid-Miocene Barreiras fan-delta caused the demise of Pirabas carbonate platform. Evidence of a mid-Miocene Cratonic Amazon River is demonstrated for the first time. The Cratonic Amazon River expands the knowledge of the Amazonian drainage system. New geotectonic framework allows clarifying the Neogene history of Eastern Amazonia. , Mixed carbonate-siliciclastic platforms developed in the onshore and offshore zones of several basins along the Amazonian coast starting in the Palaeocene. The shutdown of Miocene carbonate accumulation in distinct tectonic settings shows different evolutionary histories along the Eastern Amazonian coast. The shutdown has been attributed to the abundant siliciclastic fluvial inflow from the Andean Amazon River during the late Miocene. The combination of previously collected geological information and new stratigraphic data from the Oligocene-Miocene transgressive-regressive Pirabas-Barreiras sequence exposed on the Bragantina Platform of the Eastern Amazonian coast reveals the collapse of the carbonate platform by the Barreiras fan delta deposits during the middle Miocene. The development of the Barreiras fan delta, fed by a cratonic source exposed during the Langhian (15–10 Ma) sea-level fall, was concomitant with the so-called Cratonic Amazon River that preceded the transcontinental Andean Amazon River. The climax of sea-level fall caused the maximum expansion of the Barreiras fan delta, which reached the Marajó and Pará-Maranhão basins. The progressive denudation of the region, low fluvial inflow, and extensive Tortonian sea-level fall (11–8 Ma) resulted in the inactivity of the Barreiras Delta. Consequently, the exposure and subsequent intense lateritization of these degraded deposits generated an extensive unconformity that lasted until the deposition of Pleistocene Post-Barreiras sediments. ]"

Both the magnitude and the mineralogical composition of atmospheric dust inputs indicate that eolian deposition is an important (50%) or even dominant (&gt;80%) contribution to sediments in the offshore waters of the entire Mediterranean basin. Model data for trace metals and nutrients indicate that the atmosphere delivers more than half the lead and nitrogen, one-third of total phosphorus, and 10% of the zinc entering the entire basin. Measured data in sub-basins, such as the north-western Mediterranean and northern Adriatic indicate an even greater proportions of atmospheric versus riverine inputs. When dissolved fluxes are compared (the form most likely to impinge on surface water biogeochemical cycles), the atmosphere is found to be 5 to 50 times more important than rivers for dissolved zinc and 15 to 30 times more important for lead fluxes. Neglecting co-limitation by other nutrients, new production supported by atmospheric nitrogen deposition ranges from 2–4 g C m −2 yr −1 , whereas atmospheric phosphorus deposition appears to support less than 1 g C m −2 yr −1 . In spite of the apparently small contribution of atmospheric deposition to overall production in the basin it has been suggested that certain episodic phytoplankton blooms are triggered by atmospheric deposition of N, P or Fe. Future studies are needed to clarify the extent and causal links between these episodic blooms and atmospheric/oceanographic forcing functions. A scientific program aimed at elucidating the possible biogeochemical effects of Saharan outbreaks in the Mediterranean through direct sampling of the ocean and atmosphere before and after such events is therefore highly recommended. ]"

Relative Bray-Curtis dissimilarity coefficients calculated from the log 10 (n+1) of abundance data were used as input to the numerical classification of species and stations. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was also applied to the abundance data to examine geometric patterns in the data. The numerical analyses of the species abundance data sets for each cruise revealed spatial patterns in the ichthyoplankton that suggest the occurrence of geographically distinct assemblages of fish larvae in each region. For all three sampling regions, the assemblage structure is primarily related to bathymetry, and Shelf, Slope, and Deep-Water assemblages are described. This shallow to deep-water gradient in species occurrence and abundance reflects the habitat preference and spawning location of the adult fish. Another degree of complexity is superimposed on this primary assemblage structure in each region and seems to be related to local topography and the prevailing current patterns. The patterns in ichthyoplankton assemblages of the three regions in the northeast Pacific Ocean described here form the basis for future investigations of spatial and temporal patterns in the ichthyoplankton of the subarctic Pacific.

Cryospheric components are sensitive to climate warming, and changes in the cryosphere can lead to serious hazards to human society, while the comprehensive understanding of cryospheric hazards largely remains unknown. Here we summarized the hazards related to atmospheric, oceanic and land cryosphere. The different types of cryospheric hazards, including their phenomena, mechanisms and impacts were reviewed. Our results suggested that: 1) The recorded hazards from atmospheric cryosphere including frost, hail, freezing rain decreased or showed great spatial heterogeneities, while their future changes are difficult to predict, and the extreme cold events in winter may increase in the future; 2) Sea ice extent declines rapidly, and iceberg numbers will increase. The permafrost-dominated coastline erosion will be exacerbated by climate warming. Meanwhile, the sea level rise is expected to continue in the next decades; 3) The glacier collapse, glacial lake outbursts and paraglacial readjustments will increase in the future. Although the total area of snow cover will decrease, the heavy snow events, snow avalanches, and snowmelt floods will not decrease simultaneously. The permafrost-related rock and debris flow and thaw slump will also increase with permafrost degradation. Taken together, we concluded the cryosphere is shrinking, while cryospheric hazards will likely increase in a warming climate. ]"

However, agglutinated textures are rare in fossil microbialites and, thus, the role of trapping and binding has been debated in the last four decades. Recently, renewed attention on this subject has produced new findings of fossil agglutinated microbialites (those mainly formed by ‘trapping and binding’ and analogous to modern examples), but they are still few and geologically recent (mainly post-Paleozoic) when compared to the 3.5 Gyr long record of microbialites. In order to better understand this discrepancy between modern and fossil examples, an extensive literature review is presented here, providing the first thorough database of agglutinated microbialites, which shows that all of them are formed in shallow-marine environments and most under tidal influence. In addition, a Lower Cretaceous example is described, including very diverse microbialites, each of them formed in a particular paleoenvironment . Some of these microbialites developed in grainy settings, but only those formed in marginal-marine tide-influenced environments accreted mainly by trapping and binding the surrounding grains, being analogous of modern agglutinated microbialites, and matching the environmental pattern observed in the literature database. The combination of the literature review with the case study allows to discuss the factors that control and enhance ‘trapping and binding’: a) occurrence of grains in the microbialite environment; b) frequent currents that mobilize the grains and supply them onto the microbialite surface; c) high concentration and diversity of electrolytes in the water to increase the adhesiveness of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the microbialite surface; and d) a CaCO 3 saturation state not high enough to promote early and strong carbonate precipitation within EPS, which would eventually decrease its availability to adhere grains. Therefore, this review shows that the keys to solve the ‘trapping and binding’ debate may be environmental, because the conjuction of these hydrodynamic and hydrochemical parameters is preferentially achieved in shallow-marine settings and especially in those influenced by tides, at least since Mesozoic times. This explains the limited environmental and stratigraphic distribution of microbialites mainly formed by ‘trapping and binding’, and opens new ways to look, geologically and microbiologically, at this process, so often cited and yet so rare. ]"

However, these unique ecosystems are under pressure due to natural as well as anthropogenic threats globally. Kerala state, situated on the west coast of India, has lost 95% of the mangroves during the last three decades. The floristic diversity of mangroves in Kerala was represented by 18 species of true mangroves of which, Sonneratia alba , Avicennia alba, and Ceriops tagal were found to be rare in the State. This review examines the current status of mangrove vegetation along the Kerala coast, factors responsible for the decline of mangroves, various conservation measures adopted and the future prospects. It was found that scientific information on the mangrove area of many districts in this southern state of India is still lacking. In this context, GIS and remote sensing would be an effective tool for the identification and mapping of various mangrove patches in Kerala. Furthermore, the conservation and restoration programs of mangroves in the state have been accelerated after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunamis. Since mangroves are separate and unique ecosystems in the marine environment, exclusive mangrove forest conservation laws need to be framed, legislated and enforced. Along with this, site-specific and community-based mangrove rejuvenation and restoration programs have to be employed for the long-term management and conservation of this fast dwindling ecosystem. ]"

The associations and relationships have been established by visual examination of the dataset and the multivariate ordination techniques, Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Special attention has been given to the factors of transport and preservation of the cysts. Five associations have been recognised as being characteristic of (1) areas influenced by coastal upwelling and/or river outflow, (2) open ocean, (3) Agulhas Current and southern Benguela Current, (4) Benguela Current and (5) Walvis Bay, shelf break area. The factors dominant in influencing either directly or indirectly the cyst distributions appear to be the stratification in the upper 50 m of the water column, nutrient concentration and seasonality.

At one time, mitigation (reduction) of human emissions of greenhouse gases appeared to offer the best response to prevent the worst impacts of a changing climate. It soon became clear, however, that the world would not be able to reduce emissions quickly enough or to a level sufficient to prevent, in the words of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”. Climate change is already altering the frequency and severity of extreme weather events worldwide, and these trends are expected to increase in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, it is well recognized that adapting in place to the changing climate is necessary. Yet, that may not be enough. An additional step in responding to climate risks is emerging, one that requires fundamentally and permanently changing the human interactions with nature in parts of the world. This strategy is often referred to as “managed retreat,” but that term has become controversial, and other terms are needed that express inclusion of the positive societal benefits that can emerge from proactive action. This paper provides a review of the emerging themes within the literature of managed retreat as a climate risk management approach, uses examples from the transportation and infrastructure sector, collects and identifies important nomenclature and definitions, key decision-making considerations, and research gaps that warrant immediate attention.

Historically, surface waters have been monitored for fecal indicator bacteria (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli , enterococci), but shortcomings of the analytical test (lengthy assay) have resulted in a re-focusing of scientific efforts to improve public health protection.

Many climate-affected hazards are becoming more common, more severe, and less predictable. As a result, strengthening community resilience is more important than ever. Recognizing that many factors impact vulnerability, hazard adaptation should seek to address vulnerability on all fronts. This is where co-benefits become valuable. Here, the term ‘co-benefits’ is defined as the secondary or unintended goals of a hazard adaptation project that are additional to the project's primary function, but complementary to its objective of increasing community resilience . Co-benefits strengthen communities both by addressing hazard impacts and by increasing their capacity to cope with risks. To encourage the integration of co-benefits into more adaptation projects, this paper presents decision-makers with a tool to systematically consider project co-benefits. A scoping literature review following best practices provided insight into the current conceptualization of co-benefits in the scholarly hazards literature. It found that co-benefits help projects cope with uncertainty, that they are most valuable in situations where hazard adaptation has to compete with other pressing needs for limited resources, and that they are most commonly achieved through green concept projects (e.g., nature-based solutions). Building on this synthesis, the co-benefits identified in this review were then used to create a co-benefits scorecard. The scorecard provides insight for project design and evaluation, giving decision-makers a systematic way to consider different kinds of co-benefits and the degree to which a project pursues those benefits. ]"

The marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is considered highly vulnerable to ocean warming and sea level rise that is likely to cause its rapid and irreversible retreat. Studies of its past response to climate change are hence essential for projecting its future behaviour. The application of radiogenic and trace element provenance studies for past ice sheet reconstructions requires surveying the geographic variability of geochemical compositions of glaciomarine sediments . In this study, we characterize the provenance of the detrital fraction of 67 Late Holocene marine sediment samples collected off the Pacific margin of West Antarctica (60°W to 160°W), including 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of individual hornblende and biotite grains (&gt;150 μm), as well as Sr and Nd isotope and trace element composition of the fine-grained (&lt;63 μm) sediment fraction. Overall, this approach allows differentiating West Antarctica into five source regions: the Antarctic Peninsula , Bellingshausen Sea, Amundsen Sea, Wrigley Gulf-Hobbs Coast and Sulzberger Bay. Minor geochemical variability is found within each individual sector due to local variability in onland geology. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of iceberg-rafted hornblende and biotite grains record primarily Carboniferous to Lates Quaternary ages (~0 to 380 Ma), with a notable age peak of ~100 Ma, associated with plutonic intrusions or deformation events during the mid-Cretaceous. Permian-Jurassic 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages are widespread in the Amundsen Sea sector, marking episodes of large-volume magmatism along the long-lived continental margin . Metasedimentary rocks and Late Cenozoic alkali basalts in West Antarctica cannot be detected using detrital hornblende and biotite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages due to the absence or small grain-size (i.e. &lt;150 μm) of these minerals in such rocks. These sources can however be readily recognized by their fine-grained geochemical composition. In addition, geographic trends in the provenance from proximal to distal sites provide insights into major sediment transport pathways. While the transport of fine-grained detritus follows bathymetric cross-shelf troughs, the distribution of iceberg-rafted grains shows influence by transport in the Antarctic Coastal Current. Our study provides the first systematic geochemical characterisation of sediment provenance off West Antarctica, and highlights the importance of combining multiple provenance approaches in different size fractions of glacial-marine sediments, and paves the way to investigate past WAIS dynamics. ]"

The research on flocculation has been conducted to elucidate the SPM dynamics and to diagnose various environmental issues. The flocculation, sedimentation, and transportation of SPM are closely linked to the compositional and structural properties of flocs. In fact, flocs are highly heterogeneous in terms of composition. However, the lack of comprehensive research on floc composition and structure has led to misconceptions regarding the temporal and spatial dynamics of SPM.

Thus, quantitative estimation of crustal deformation , earthquake occurrence process and seismic vulnerability along this densely populated region is considered to be paramount. However, diverse opinion exists regarding the strain accumulation, status of active convergence, and associated seismic vulnerability across the IBA. In addition, the IBA is surrounded by several seismo-tectonically active geodynamic units such as deformation front of Northeast Himalaya, Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis (EHS), Assam-Brahmaputra valley, Shillong Plateau, and laterally extruding Tibetan lithosphere in adjacent Sundaland block, etc. However, the geodynamic interaction and associated complexities of these regions and their interaction with the IBA remain elusive. In the present review article, these tectonic deformation aspects of the IBA have been explored by constraining geodetic and seismological observations. By constraining geodetic observations, the Euler rotation parameters of the Indian and Sunda plates are estimated. It is observed that the India-Sunda long-term relative plate motion (~37 mm/year) is distributed among three major active fault systems, namely, the Sagaing Fault (SF) (~18 mm/year), Churachandpur-Mao Fault (CMF) (~17 mm/year), and the Blind megathrust (BMT) (~7 mm/year), from east to west across the IBA respectively. The estimated convergence across the BMT is significantly lower than the earlier estimates. Moreover, due to the large scatter in the geodetic data close to the updip edge of the BMT, it is not certain whether the motion across the detachment is accommodated through shallow creep or in a stick-slip manner thus leading to uncertainty in seismic hazard in this densely populated region. Further, in the Northeast Himalaya, the lateral extrusion model of the Tibetan crust appears to contradict with the oblique convergence model of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogeny . Geodetic observations indicate that the overall India-southern Tibet convergence in the Northeast Himalaya (i.e., Bhutan and Arunachal Himalaya) is about 20–25% less than that in the neighboring central Himalaya and EHS. This deficiency of motion is accommodated through distributed deformation along the Dauki Fault and Naga Thrust, which suggests that these two units participate in the Northeast Himalayan strain budget via distributed deformation along the Assam-Brahmaputra valley. Thus, it is proposed that instead of partitioning in the backarc, the Northeast Himalaya has developed an active sliver along the Assam-Brahmaputra valley in the outer deformation front of Main Frontal Thrust in order to accommodate the deficiency in long-term plate convergence . It is argued that the strong eastward extrusion of Tibetan crust in the backarc is the main driving force for such unusual development of sliver in the outer deformation front. From this, it appears that the IBA is a geodynamically and seismo-tectonically complex domain where more data and instrumentations are needed to better characterize the crustal deformation , earthquake occurrence process, and seismic vulnerability in this densely populated region. ]"

Efficiency of terrestrial biodegradation is pCO 2 and temperature specific at northern mid palaeolatitudes. δ 13 C wood , TOC cont and temperature respond to carbon cycle forcing. Stomatal index results are compatible with the interpreted temperature trends. Reliable δ 13 C chemostratigraphic correlation of marine and marginal/non-marine deposits demonstrated. , New carbon-isotope data obtained from homogenous organic material (separated microfossil wood; δ 13 C wood ) from the upper Rhaetian and entire Lower Jurassic permit chemostratigraphic correlation of these marginal/non-marine deposits with the biostratigraphically well-constrained Llanbedr (Mochras Farm) core in N Wales and other marine profiles, supported by sequence stratigraphic correlation and biostratigraphical markers. Statistically significant (Rs = 0.61) positive exponential correlation between δ 13 C wood values and continental TOC (TOC cont ) concentrations occurs and can be defined empirically by equation. Changes of δ 13 C wood observed in C3 plants depends on δ 13 CO 2 of atmosphere and can be modulated by other factors such as pCO 2 causing fractionation (enrichment in 12 C) of C isotopes in source C3 plants and, to lesser extent, by soil moisture content. Floral remains occurring in the relatively stable palaeolatitude and climatic zone of the Polish Basin in the time interval studied lend no support for significant precipitation impact on the δ 13 C fractionation, although enhanced precipitation could have had a limited impact during the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE). We argue that the observed relation between δ 13 C wood values and TOC cont reflects the global carbon cycle forcing. Such correlations may develop because fluxes of of 12 C-enriched methane, mobilized from near-surface carbon sources, lead to global warming, decreased δ 13 C wood and enhanced (usually fungally-mediated) decomposition of the terrestrial carbon pool, while subsequent massive burial of organic carbon results in higher δ 13 C values in all carbon cycle reservoirs, and the attendant drawdown of atmospheric CO 2 leads to global cooling and promotes sequestration of soil organic matter . In turn, this relation can be used as an indirect indicator of atmospheric temperature trends, although organic carbon isotope records are potentially subject to many different influences. Based on the δ 13 C wood /TOC cont relationship, an approximate qualitative estimation of general trends in air temperature is suggested for c. 40 o N paleolatitude and the warm temperate climatic zone. The observed hypothetical trends in temperature are generally in concordance with pCO 2 trends calculated from stomatal index. A weak δ 13 C wood and TOC cont correlation in Rhaetian deposits is explained by local environmental factors (TOC concentration dependent on a more localized fluvial plain settings), while mostly deltaic – coastal deposits contain more representative, averaged material delivered from a large catchment area . ]"

Absence or inconsistency of long-term climate or ecosystem data is problematic. , Overfishing and human-induced climate change are putting severe pressure on marine ecosystems . In the southern Benguela, most of South Africa's commercial fisheries have a long history of exploitation and this, coupled with spatio-temporal changes in key species over the last three decades has severely impacted some of South Africa's fisheries and ecosystems. This review summarizes these spatio-temporal changes and investigates possible drivers thereof. It incorporates both past and current research, with a large portion of the latter having formed part of the University of Cape Town's Ma-Re BASICS (Marine Research in the Benguela and Agulhas Systems for supporting Interdisciplinary Climate-change Science) 2010–2013 program. Almost all described changes involve a temporal decline or a spatial shift in species. Fishing seems to have played a role in many of the observed stock declines, for example through geographically disproportionate catches in relation to stock distribution. In some cases, changes in the physical environment seem to have played an additional role, e.g., rock lobsters on the west coast have been affected by fishing as well as changes in the physical environment. In almost all cases these changes have taken place since the 1980s/1990s, except for one or two resources, which have experienced declines since at least the mid 20th century. Spatial shifts in species have either involved an eastward expansion of cool-water species, including kelps , rock lobster and pelagic fish , or a retraction of warm-water species such as the brown mussel, suggesting a cooling of inshore waters along the south-west coast since the 1980s. This suggested cooling is revealed in ocean temperature (SST Pathfinder), wind and upwelling data for the Cape Peninsula and south-west coast region during the same period. The absence or inconsistency of long-term data is problematic when trying to identify drivers of ecosystem change, and actual ecosystem change itself. We discuss this using ocean temperature in the southern Benguela as an example. In addition, the complex interplay between climate and anthropogenic (notably fishing) drivers makes identification of drivers difficult and disentangling these combined effects will require interdisciplinary collaboration, co-ordinated ecosystem projects, increased modelling effort and the continuation, but also establishment, of new, long-term monitoring studies. ]"

This paper attempts to make a review by synthesizing existing structural, petrological, geochronological and geochemical data of the Cretaceous structures and magmas, which guides us to propose a three-stage tectono-thermal evolutionary history of South China during the Cretaceous period . The earliest Cretaceous (145–137 Ma) tectonic stage was characterized by syn-orogenic shortening deformation and metamorphism under a NW–SE compressional setting, which generated voluminous porphyry Cu–Au ore-bearing adakitic rocks in the Lower Yangtze River Belt and gneissic granites in the coastal area. Its geodynamic origin was interpreted as combined effects of the Pacific–Izanagi ridge subduction beneath the Lower Yangtze River Belt and the Pacific subduction beneath the Cathaysia Block. This syn-orogenic shortening stage was followed by a post orogenic stage (136–86 Ma) comprising two episodes of alternate extensional and shortening events. The extension (136–118 Ma) in the earlier episode was dominated by a NW–SE extensional regime, it led to significant taphrogenesis manifested by large-scale extensional basins and voluminous magma intrusion/eruption; this extensional event was associated with a combination of the slab window opening during the ridge subduction and the rollback of the subducted Pacific slab. The subsequent NW–SE transpressional event led to cessation of active marginal magmatism and resulted in tectonic inversion of previous rift basins; this transpression lasted from 117 Ma to 108 Ma, and its driving mechanism was attributed to the collision between the eastern Asian margin and the West Philippine Block. The extension (107–86 Ma) in the later episode was dominated by a WNW–ESE extensional regime, which led to a second phase of basin subsidence and produced numerous A- and I-type granites and bimodal volcanoes . The tectonic regime then changed at ca. 85 Ma to WNW–ESE-oriented transpression , causing inversion of the Late Cretaceous rift basins and cessation of extension-related magmatism . The change of stress field from WNW–ESE extension to WNW–ESE transpression was related to the variations of the subducted slab dynamics, i.e., the transition from either the ESE-ward retreat to WNW-ward subduction of the Pacific slab, or the alternate stress during slab break-off. During the latest Cretaceous, a drastic change of regional tectonic stress orientation from WNW–ESE to N–S occurred in South China, the third stage predominated by N–S extension was developed, which caused a new phase of regional crustal subsidence along the youngest E–W trending extensional structures. ]"

Although use of the term has become somewhat indiscriminate in the interim, it is here considered best reserved for the distinctive stratal rhythms characteristic of the late Palaeozoic in the palaeotropical realm of Laurussia, recording repeated alternation of marine and nonmarine depositional conditions. Cyclothems comprise arrays of terrigenous clastic, organic, and chemical/biochemical lithologies that record accumulation mainly on slowly-subsiding platforms and ramps, under limited accommodation and limited sediment supply, often strongly seasonal tropical and subtropical climates, and forcing by repeated, large-magnitude excursions of sea level. A spectrum of variation is recognized, from carbonate-mudrock-dominated variants at one extreme to coarse clastic-dominated styles at the other. Cyclothems can be rationalized as depositional sequences which are thin (metres to a few tens of metres), condensed, incomplete in terms of systems tracts, and top-truncated. Given their demonstrated widespread extent, cyclothems have been attributed by many researchers to forcing by eustatic sea-level fluctuations, and a variety of evidence suggests they correlate to 100 kyr glacial cycles on Gondwana . By analogy with Quaternary 100 kyr glacial cycles, much of the time in a cycle was taken up by a protracted, complex drawdown of sea-level, during which valleys and channels were excavated and interfluves were pedogenically modified. Most of the depositional record of cyclothems probably formed in the relatively short interval following lowstand/glacial maximum when sea-level rose to its interglacial maximum. Analysis of cyclothemic successions can contribute to a fuller understanding of the magnitude of sea-level excursions and palaeoclimatic changes during the late Palaeozoic , and can help to pinpoint the timing of key events such as the main onset of the late Palaeozoic Ice Age. ]"

The largest known tsunamis followed either a strong intraplate earthquake (1867, Virgin Islands) or were transoceanic due to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. In this region, where the convergence rate between the American and Caribbean plate is low, the recurrence time of large earthquakes may be long (several centuries or millennia) and the historical record of such events is short. It is thus difficult to estimate their impact and becomes crucial to gain information from longer-term geological records and tsunami modeling. An increasing number of old prehistoric tsunami deposits have been identified in recent years on several islands in the northern segment of the Lesser Antilles arc, between Antigua and Puerto-Rico, in Anegada, St-Thomas (Virgin Islands), Anguilla and Scrub islands. Here, we carefully review all those studies and evidenced that most tsunami deposits are about 500 to 800 years old (1200 to 1500 cal yrs. CE) likely suggesting a large event or a cluster of events at that time. We combined information provided by the sedimentological records (distribution and altitude of the sediment deposits) and tsunami models to discuss the origin of the middle age Pre-Colombian event(s). We listed all faults as possible sources of tsunamis in this complex tectonic region. We performed 35 run-up models by using high-resolution/topographic grids to compare the simulated wave heights and run-up distance to the sediment record. We showed that few models are able to generate tsunami waves which heights and run-up distances match the characteristic of the observed tsunami deposits. These models are Magnitude class 9 M-thrust earthquakes rupturing the subduction interface between 30 km in depth to the trench facing Anegada Island. Magnitude class 8 outer-rise earthquakes, modeled along the trench, are other candidates for the Pre-Columbian event(s) although less convincing than the mega-thrust ones. The realism of these models is discussed in the light of the recent coupling models of the subduction zone based on short-term geodetic records. Finally, considering all the results and data, the equally strong hypothesis that these sediments were deposited by one or several storms remains less convincing than our tsunamigenic earthquakes scenarios. We conclude that the occurrence of one or several large megathrust or outer-rise earthquakes in association with damaging tsunamis likely have occurred in the past in the Lesser Antilles and could occur again in the future. This opens the discussion on the threat posed by such catastrophic event in these densely populated and touristic regions. ]"

In many instances, the deformation is large enough to be detected with space based geodetic techniques as well as with terrestrial gravity observations. For example, atmospheric loading induced crustal deformations on the order of 20 mm are possible at high latitudes with accompanying changes in gravity of 6 μGals. Non-tidal ocean loading effects can typically cause 5 mm (2 mm root-mean-square, RMS) in vertical positioning at coastal geodetic sites with displacements of up to 10 mm possible. Deformation associated gravity changes are usually on the order of 2–3 μGals, however peak-to-peak changes of 5 μGals are also predicted. The effects of regional ground water variations on geodetic measurements are less well known. Model results indicate that annual changes in gravity and vertical positioning can be as large as 2 μGals and 5 mm for sites where there is significant annual snowfall.

We review the benefits, issues, and uncertainties of carcass management methods. Many stakeholders involved in whale carcass management create ambiguity. Clear legislation and protocols around whale carcass management are needed. Research on implications of whale carcass disposal is needed to inform managers. , The management of stranded whale carcasses is a logistical, environmental and economic challenge concerning a number of different stakeholders. In this paper, we review the current carcass disposal methods, stakeholders involved, and identify research needs and gaps. Examples of carcass disposals from all over the world are presented with Australia used as an example of current governance procedures and related challenges. Current management options include (1) leaving a carcass to decompose in situ , (2) beach burial, (3) oceanic tow, and (4) transport to waste management facility or rendering plant. Leaving a carcass to decompose in situ is the most cost effective and natural method, but raises issues of sight, smell, changes in sediment and groundwater chemistry , and shark attraction. Beach burials remove the sight and smell of a carcass and are relatively cost effective, but the extent to which carcass burial alters beach groundwater and attracts sharks to the surf due to leachate transported via submarine groundwater discharge is unknown. Oceanic tows are a simple disposal method, but carcasses can become boating hazards and may return ashore. Transporting carcasses to a waste management or rendering plant is costly, but effectively removes most social and environmental issues associated with a carcass stranding. The management of stranded carcasses involves a number of stakeholders with differing missions and priorities, from government agencies to conservation groups. Differences in priorities often cause tensions between groups increasing the complexity of carcass disposals. This review identifies key challenges and potential issues to guide decisions that are often made at a local scale. We recommend that clear legislation and organisational responsibilities are needed to prevent ambiguity when managing carcass disposal. ]"

Weight of evidence assessment criteria proposed for the AEP framework. The world's first AEPs for microplastics developed and demonstrated by cases. Critical knowledge gaps identified by quantitative analysis of AEPs. Future directions in microplastic risk assessment suggested. , Microplastics as emerging contaminants have been detected from peaks to poles. High concerns on the risks of microplastic pollution to humans and ecosystems have therefore been raised in the past decade. While a large number of studies have been conducted to investigate the environmental levels and toxicity of microplastics, the information generated to support risk assessment is fragmented and the coherence between different types of study is largely lacking. Here we introduced the Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP), a conceptual framework originally proposed for chemical exposure assessment, to facilitate organization, visualization and evaluation of existing information generated from microplastic research, and to efficiently identify future knowledge and regulatory needs. A putative microplastic AEP network (mpAEP) was developed to demonstrate the concept and model development strategies. Two mpAEP case studies, with polyethylene (PE) as a prototype, were then presented based on existing environmental exposure data collected from the Changjiang Estuary and the East China Sea (Case I), and the Oslo Fjord (Case II), respectively. Weight of evidence (WoE) assessment of the mpAEPs were performed for evaluating the essentiality, theoretical plausibility, empirical evidence and quantitative understanding of the evidence and relationships in the AEPs. Both cases showed moderate/high WoE to support the strength of the models, whereas also displayed clear knowledge gaps, thus providing guidance for future investigations and regulations. The mpAEP framework introduced herein presents a novel strategy for organizing fragmented information from diverse types of microplastic research, enhancing mechanistic understanding of causal relationships and facilitating the development of quantitative prediction models for research and regulation in the future. ]"

For decades, the threshold slope model has been invoked to account for landslide-driven increases in sediment flux that limit topographic relief, but the manner by which slope failures organize themselves spatially and temporally in order for erosion to keep pace with rock uplift has not been well documented. Here, we review past work and present new findings from remote sensing , cosmogenic radionuclides , suspended sediment records, and airborne lidar data, to decipher patterns of landslide activity and geomorphic processes related to rapid uplift along the northward-migrating Mendocino Triple Junction in Northern California. From historical air photos and airborne lidar, we estimated the velocity and sediment flux associated with active, slow-moving landslides (or earthflows) in the mélange- and argillite-dominated Eel River watershed using the downslope displacement of surface markers such as trees and shrubs. Although active landslides that directly convey sediment into the channel network account for only 7% of the landscape surface, their sediment flux amounts to more than 50% of the suspended load recorded at downstream sediment gaging stations. These active slides tend to exhibit seasonal variations in velocity as satellite-based interferometry has demonstrated that rapid acceleration commences within 1 to 2 months of the onset of autumn rainfall events before slower deceleration ensues in the spring and summer months. Curiously, this seasonal velocity pattern does not appear to vary with landslide size, suggesting that complex hydrologic–mechanical feedbacks (rather than 1-D pore pressure diffusion) may govern slide dynamics. A new analysis of 14 yrs of discharge and sediment concentration data for the Eel River indicates that the characteristic mid-winter timing of earthflow acceleration corresponds with increased suspended concentration values , suggesting that the seasonal onset of landslide motion each year may be reflected in the export of sediments to the continental margin . The vast majority of active slides exhibit gullied surfaces and the gully networks, which are also seasonally active, may facilitate sediment export although the proportion of material produced by this pathway is poorly known. Along Kekawaka Creek, a prominent tributary to the Eel River, new analyses of catchment-averaged erosion rates derived from cosmogenic radionuclides reveal rapid erosion (0.76 mm/yr) below a prominent knickpoint and slower erosion (0.29 mm/yr) upstream. Such knickpoints are frequently observed in Eel tributaries and are usually comprised of massive (&gt; 10 m) interlocking resistant boulders that likely persist in the landscape for long periods of time (&gt; 10 5 yr). Upstream of these knickpoints, active landslides tend to be less frequent and average slope angles are slightly gentler than in downstream areas, which indicates that landslide density and average slope angle appear to increase with erosion rate. Lastly, we synthesize evidence for the role of large, catastrophic landslides in regulating sediment flux and landscape form. The emergence of resistant blocks within the mélange bedrock has promoted large catastrophic slides that have dammed the Eel River and perhaps generated outburst events in the past. The frequency and impact of these landslide dams likely depend on the spatial and size distributions of resistant blocks relative to the width and drainage area of adjacent valley networks. Overall, our findings demonstrate that landslides within the Eel River catchment do not occur randomly, but instead exhibit spatial and temporal patterns related to baselevel lowering, climate forcing, and lithologic variations. Combined with recent landscape evolution models that incorporate landslides, these results provide predictive capability for estimating erosion rates and managing hazards in mountainous regions. ]"

NBFRs showed high bioaccumulation properties but weak metabolic activities in aquatic animals. Sorption rather than biotransformation determines their fate in the aquatic environment . Source emission areas are the compartments most vulnerable to NBFR risks. The environmental safety in substitution of legacy BFRs by NBFRs need to be further evaluated. , Novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs), which have been developed as replacements for legacy flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), are a class of alternative flame retardants with emerging and widespread applications. The ubiquitous occurrence of NBFRs in the aquatic environments and the potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms have initiated intense global concerns. The present article, therefore, identifies and analyzes the current state of knowledge on the occurrence, bioaccumulation, fates, and environmental and health risks of NBFRs in aquatic environments. The key findings from this review are that (1) the distribution of NBFRs are source-dependent in the global aquatic environments, and several NBFRs have been reported at higher concentrations than that of the legacy flame retardants; (2) high bioaccumulative properties have been found for all of the discussed NBFRs due to their strong hydrophobic characteristics and weak metabolic rates; (3) the limited information available suggests that NBFRs are resistant to biotic and abiotic degradation processes and that sorption to sludge and sediments are the main fate of NBFRs in the aquatic environments; (4) the results of ecological risk assessments have indicated the potential risks of NBFRs and have suggested that source areas are the most vulnerable environmental compartments.

Processes of OMPs’ photodegradation was compared to biodegradation. Understanding on roles of DOM on photodegradation is concisely updated. Major knowledge gaps in environmental photochemistry are identified. , Photochemical reactions widely occur in the aquatic environment and play fundamental roles in aquatic ecosystems. In particular, solar-induced photodegradation is efficient for many organic micropollutants (OMPs), especially those that cannot undergo hydrolysis or biodegradation, and thus can mitigate chemical pollution. Recent reports indicate that photodegradation may play a more important role than biodegradation in many OMP transformations in the aquatic environment. Photodegradation can be influenced by the water matrix such as pH, inorganic ions, and dissolved organic matter (DOM). The effect of the water matrix such as DOM on photodegradation is complex, and new insights concerning the disparate effects of DOM have recently been reported. In addition, the photodegradation process is also influenced by physical factors such as latitude, water depth, and temporal variations in sunlight as these factors determine the light conditions. However, it remains challenging to gain an overview of the importance of photodegradation in the aquatic environment because the reaction involved are diverse and complex. Therefore, this review provides a concise summary of the importance of photodegradation and the major processes related to photodegradation of OMPs, with particular attention given to recent progress on the major reactions of DOM. In addition, major knowledge gaps in this field of environmental photochemistry are highlighted. ]"

(2010) that deposits of “Distributive Fluvial Systems” (DFS) may form the bulk of the continental fluvial record. Weissmann et al. (2010) define DFS as “a pattern of channel and floodplain deposits that radiate outward from an apex that is located where the river enters the sedimentary basin”. As such, DFS are fan-like systems on which multiple channels coexist and distribute water and sediment across the fan. Published criteria for the recognition of DFS (Weissmann et al., 2010) are 1) a radial pattern of channels from the DFS apex; 2) downslope decreases in channel size; 3) down-DFS grain-size decreases; and 4) a lack of lateral channel confinement. However, in Weissmann et al. (2010) and subsequent papers, only the first of these criteria is applied rigorously, thus allowing a variety of types of fluvial system (including avulsive, incised, anabranching, and coastal plain distributary systems) to potentially be classified uncritically as DFS. An ancient succession formed by DFS should preserve mostly small channel bodies, with a limited range of dimensions and no outsized channel bodies. Channel bodies in DFS-dominated successions should also decrease in size in a down-palaeoslope direction and show palaeocurrent relationships indicative of radial dispersal. In order for the term DFS to be applied, these characteristics should also be established within stratigraphic bodies that formed coevally. However, very few examples have yet been published that satisfy these criteria. If the claim that DFS dominate the alluvial stratigraphic record is valid, then few, if any, sedimentary bodies formed by large channels should be preserved. A review of published research demonstrates, however, that the alluvial stratigraphic record contains a broad diversity of fluvial network styles, including abundant representatives of tributary, avulsive, anabranching, and incised, in addition to distributary types. It is also clear that the deposits of large, main stem rivers that are comparable to the big rivers of the modern world are abundantly preserved in the stratigraphic record. An analysis of the planimetric area of modern tributary and distributary fluvial systems is presented, demonstrating that tributary systems are also likely to represent a far larger proportion of the ancient sedimentary record than DFS. The body of evidence presented herein from modern and ancient alluvial systems thus suggests that the hypothesis of Weissmann et al. (2010) should be wholly rejected. DFS do not dominate the continental stratigraphic record. ]"

An extensive grid of high-resolution seismic data , hundreds of sediment cores and borings and a robust chronostratigraphic framework were used to examine the evolution of late Quaternary depositional systems of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico throughout the last eustatic cycle (~ 125 ka to Present). The study area includes fluvial systems with a wide range of drainage basin sizes, climate settings and water and sediment discharges. Detailed paleogeographic reconstructions are used to derive volumetric estimates of sediment fluxes (Volume Accumulation Rates). The results show that the response of rivers to sea-level rise and fall varied across the region. Larger rivers, including the former Mississippi, Western Louisiana (presumably the ancestral Red River), Brazos, Colorado and Rio Grande rivers, constructed deltas that advanced across the shelf in step-wise fashion during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5–2. Sediment delivery to these deltas increased during the overall sea-level fall due to increases in drainage basin area and erosion of sediment on the inner shelf, where subsidence is minimal, and transport of that sediment to the more rapidly subsiding outer shelf. The sediment supply from the Brazos River to its delta increased at least 3-fold and the supply of the Colorado River increased at least 6-fold by the late stages of sea-level fall through the lowstand . Repeated filling and purging of fluvial valleys from ~ 119–22 ka contributed to the episodic growth of falling-stage deltas. During the MIS 2 lowstand (~ 22–17 ka), the Mississippi River abandoned its falling-stage fluvial–deltaic complex on the western Louisiana shelf and drained to the Mississippi Canyon. Likewise, the Western Louisiana delta was abandoned, presumably due to merger of the Red River with the Mississippi River, terminating growth of the Western Louisiana delta. The Brazos River abandoned its MIS 3 shelf margin delta to merge with the Trinity, Sabine and Calcasieu rivers and together these rivers nourished a lowstand delta and slope fan complex. The Colorado and Rio Grande rivers behaved more as point sources of sediment to thick lowstand delta–fan complexes. Lowstand incised valleys exhibit variable morphologies that mainly reflect differences in onshore and offshore relief and the time intervals these valleys were occupied. They are deeper and wider than falling stage channel belts and are associated with a shelf-wide surface of erosion (sequence boundary). During the early MIS 1 (~ 17 ka to ~ 10 ka) sea-level rise, the offshore incised valleys of the Calcasieu, Sabine, Trinity, Brazos, Colorado, and Rio Grande rivers were filled with sediment. The offshore valleys of smaller rivers of central Texas would not be filled until the late Holocene , mainly by highstand mud. The lower, onshore portions of east Texas incised valleys were filled with sediment mainly during the Holocene , with rates of aggradation in the larger Brazos and Colorado valleys being in step with sea-level rise. Smaller rivers filled their valleys with back-stepping fluvial, estuarine and tidal delta deposits that were offset by flooding surfaces. In general, the sediment trapping capacity of bays increased as evolving barrier islands and peninsulas slowly restricted tidal exchange with the Gulf and valley filling led to more shallow, wider bays. A widespread period of increased riverine sediment flux and delta growth is attributed to climate change during MIS 1, between ~ 11.5 and 8.0 ka, and occurred mainly under cool-wet climate conditions. Relatively small sea-level oscillations during the MIS 1 transgression (~ 17 ka to ~ 4.0 ka) profoundly influenced coastal evolution , as manifested by landward stepping shorelines , on the order of tens of kilometers within a few thousand years. The current barriers, strand plains and chenier plains of the study area formed at different times over the past ~ 8 ka, due mainly to differences in sand supply and the highly variable relief on the MIS 2 surface on which these systems formed. Modern highstand deposition on the continental shelf formed the Texas Mud Blanket, which occurs on the central Texas shelf and records a remarkable increase in fine-grained sediment supply. This increase is attributed to greater delivery of sediments from the Colorado and Brazos rivers, which had filled their lower valleys and abandoned their transgressive deltas by late Holocene time, and to an increase in westward directed winds and surface currents that delivered suspended sediments from the Mississippi River to the Texas shelf. Collectively, our results demonstrate that source-to-sink analyses in low gradient basin settings requires a long-term perspective, ideally a complete eustatic cycle, because most of the sediment that was delivered to the basin by rivers underwent more than one cycle of erosion, transport and sedimentation that was regulated by sea-level rise and fall. Climate was a secondary control. The export of sediments from the hinterland to the continental shelf was not directly in step with temperature change, but rather varied between different fluvial–deltaic systems. ]"

Ecosystem losses influence all dimensions of disaster risk. Recommendations on integrating ecosystem losses in disaster loss monitoring. , Climate-related hazards, more specifically droughts, floods and storms, cause the largest share of people affected by disasters and major economic losses. While social and economic disaster-related losses are monitored and documented, this is not well established for the environmental losses. It is well known that environmental degradation is a key driver of disaster risk. As such, healthy ecosystems are acknowledged to contribute to disaster risk reduction (DRR) through their ecosystem services (ES). Yet they are at the same time heavily affected by disasters. Disaster-related losses of ecosystems and their services as well as the implication on overall DRR are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, this research builds on a structured review of peer-reviewed literature and Post-Disaster Needs Assessments (PDNAs) to generate scientific evidence of disaster-related losses of ecosystems and ES to the climate-related hazards droughts, floods and storms. The established database of disaster-related losses of ecosystems provided the basis to further explore the link between disaster-related losses of ecosystems and related losses of ES. An additional review of scientific literature delivered evidence that losses of ES are many times higher than documented so far. In order to better understand, how disaster-related losses of ecosystems and ES ultimately alter disaster risk, we showcase the link between disaster-related losses of ecosystems and their services against the three dimensions of disaster risk. Regulating ES reduce disaster risk through mitigating hazard and exposure. Provisioning, regulating, habitat and cultural ES help to reduce vulnerability. Disasters diminish the capacity of ecosystems to provide ES, which leads to increasing disaster risk. We conclude this research with three constructive recommendations for integrating disaster-related losses of ecosystems and ES in a more comprehensive manner into disaster risk monitoring – notably the monitoring structure of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The aim of these recommendations is to support a more comprehensive monitoring of disaster-related losses including the environmental dimension and better acknowledge the role and contribution of ecosystems for advancing DRR. ]"

Epicontinental sea mud transport operates by bedload transport of flocculated muds. In the rock record this transport mode is signified by silt laminated shales. The seabed is flat because bedload transport process readily fills in “holes”. , Fine grained clastic sediments are very common in the interior deposits of ancient epicontinental seas . Not only do they make up the gross lithology in these basins, but they can also be traced for more than 1000 km offshore from basin margins. Given that epicontinental seas were overall shallow and in many parts most likely less than 100 m deep, basin floor slopes can safely be expected to be in the 0.01 to 0.001° range for much of depositional history. Known processes that bring muds to the basin margin and beyond are hypopycnal river plumes , hyperpycnal fluvial discharge events, storm-setup relaxation flows, and gravity-driven fluidized muds. With the exception of river plumes, all of these processes require the presence of sufficient slope for sustained movement. Due to that constraint, these processes combined might in the majority of situations have been able to move muddy sediments on the order of 100 km offshore. Whereas this is sufficient to distribute mud across marginal shelf seas, it becomes problematic in the case of much larger epicontinental seas. For example, those of Upper Devonian or Upper Cretaceous times extended in places for thousands of kilometers, and thus a process is needed that can move muddy sediments the rest of the way. Flume studies of the bedload transport of mud, combined with observations from the rock record, suggest that wind or tide induced bottom current circulation was most likely essential for moving muddy sediments from the periphery of epicontiental seas to their interiors. Remobilization of seafloor muds during frequently recurring lowering of sea level is likely to have aided in this process. ]"

Recognition of peat depositional environments for coal is a challenging endeavor because coal's observed compositional properties not only result from a variety of geological processes operating during peat accumulation, but also reflect the influence of adjoining or external depositional sedimentary environments and alteration during later diagenesis and/or epigenesis. The maceral or microlithotype composition of any one layer of peat can be the product of years or decades of plant growth, death, decay, and post-burial infiltration by roots in addition to the symbiotic, mutualistic, parasitic, and saprophytic relationships with non-plant biota, such as arthropods, fungi, and bacteria. The overprint of increasing thermal maturation and fluid migration through time on the resulting coal can make these relationships difficult to recognize. Therefore, published models based on maceral composition alone must be used with great caution. Lipid compositions, even from lipid-poor low-rank coals, can provide important information about depositional environments and paleoclimate , especially if combined with the results of organic petrography and paleontological studies. Just as sulfur derived from seawater provides environmental clues, the ratios of two particularly relevant trace elements rather than a single trace element can be used to interpret peat depositional environments. Epigenetic minerals, as well as their corresponding chemical compositions should not be used for such a purpose; similarly, resistant terrigenous minerals deposited during peat accumulation in many cases should be used with considerable caution. The interactions of the biota present in the peat-forming ecosystem, often determined using palynological and geochemical proxies, and their interpretation in the context of geography and paleoclimate are important means for deciphering peat depositional environments. Overall, a combination of evidence from geochemistry , mineralogy , palynology, and petrology of coal and from stratigraphy, sedimentology , and sedimentary facies of related rocks is necessary for accurate and comprehensive determination of depositional environments. The need for interdisciplinary studies is underscored by peat compositional properties, which have been greatly affected by various processes during the syngenetic, diagenetic or epigenetic stages of coal formation. ]"

While the subtropical cells (STCs) of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans connect subtropical subduction regimes with tropical upwelling via equatorward thermocline flows and coastal undercurrents, much of the upwelling in the Indian Ocean occurs in the coastal regimes of the northern hemisphere. Consequently, the counterpart of the STCs of the other oceans has to be a cross-equatorial cell connecting the southern subtropical subduction zone via the Somali Current with the upwelling areas off Somalia and Oman. The southward return flow is by interior Ekman transports. This annual-mean picture is accomplished by a dominance of the summer monsoon, during which only northern upwelling occurs, over the winter monsoon. Pathways of the thermocline flows related to the shallow overturning circulations are investigated here and estimates of subduction and upwelling are presented. From the observed mean northward flow of thermocline waters within the Somali Current and the interior southward cross-equatorial return flow the magnitude of the cross-equatorial cell is estimated at 6 Sv, with part of the thermocline waters being supplied by the Indonesian Throughflow. From observations we estimate that the northern upwelling occurs dominantly through the offshore outflows of the Somali Current by the Southern Gyre and Great Whirl and to a lesser degree off Oman. However, we also present model results suggesting a much lower role of Somali upwelling and a significant contribution from open-ocean upwelling in cyclonic domes around India and Sri Lanka. An interesting aspect of the Indian Ocean cross-equatorial cell is the mechanism by which the Ekman transport crosses the equator. Typically, Ekman transports during the summer (winter) monsoon are southward (northward) on both sides of the equator, while mean meridional winds on the equator are in the respective opposite direction. Earlier model evidence had suggested that this type of forcing should lead to an equatorial roll with northward surface flow and southward subsurface flow during the summer monsoon and reverse orientation during the winter monsoon. Observational evidence is presented here, based on shipboard ADCP sections, moored stations and surface drifters, confirming the existence of the equatorial roll. It is strongly developed in the western Indian Ocean during the SW monsoon where the wind conditions for the roll are best met. While in the central Indian Ocean and during the winter monsoon the roll appears to be a more transient phenomenon, superimposed by equatorial-wave currents. The evidence further suggests that the roll is mostly confined to the surface-mixed layer and is, therefore, of little consequence for the meridional heat transport. ]"

Distinguishing additives in production from sea uptake is not straightforward. Risk assessment of MP should also consist of a risk component from plastic particle. , This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the risk assessment of plastic-associated residual additives, i.e. residual monomers , degradation products and additives, in the marine environment, also considering effects of weathering and bioavailability . Experimental studies have found a number of organic and metal additive compounds in leachates from plastics, and the analysis of weathered plastic particles, such as polyethylene , polypropylene and polystyrene particles sampled on beaches and shorelines , has identified residual additives, such as flame retardants , plasticizers , UV stabilizers and antioxidants. While the transfer of e.g. PBDEs to organisms upon ingestion has been demonstrated, studies on uptake and bioaccumulation of plastic-associated chemicals are inconclusive. Studies on hazard and risk assessments are few, and focus on monomers and/or a limited number of high concentration additives, such as phthalates and flame retardants. The risk assessment results vary between low, moderate and high risks of specific additives, and are not necessarily consistent for the same compound. Given the large number of chemicals potentially introduced into the marine environment with plastic particles and the challenges associated with the correct quantification of exposure concentrations and toxicity thresholds, the question arises whether new risk assessment concepts may be needed. ]"

The impacts of climate change on wastewater systems are numerous and can lead to wide ranging implications over changing timescales. This paper considers the significance of the impacts and implications, how they will be distributed across different groups, how they will manifest in different contexts and locations, and conclude by proposing a range of guiding principles for local government decision makers. The research firstly considered direct climate-related impacts on a range of wastewater system elements (including reticulated wastewater systems, on-site wastewater systems and treatment plants), in both urban and peri -urban settings in New Zealand. The impacts identified for each aspect of the wastewater network were found to fit within three broad impact themes; nuisance flooding spills and odour, water quality deterioration due to increased uncontrolled discharges and damage to infrastructure. The research shows that the immediate and long-term implications resulting from these impacts are likely to be experienced widely across the social, cultural, environmental and economic domains. Examples include loss and damage to assets - leading to disruption to communities, water quality deterioration with consequential social, environmental, economic and cultural effects, public health risks, and economic costs related to damages, foregone production and insurance. Cultural implications are of particular importance in a New Zealand context, given the strong connection of Māori to the environment and water. ]"

The effectiveness of China's MPAs urgently needs to be improved through adaptive management. The lack of a standardized framework, survey data, financial support, and public engagement hinder the MEEs forChina's MPAs. A comprehensive and standardized framework was proposed for China's MPAs. , Rapid population growth is putting enormous pressure on fragile marine ecosystems. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a widely adopted management tool to address these challenges, but their conservation effectiveness is uncertain, especially in developing countries such as China. Management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) is an efficient method for assessing MPA outcomes and identifying key impact factors. However, only a limited number of MEEs have been conducted for China's MPAs in the past two decades, thus largely limiting their improvement of management. In this context, we conducted a comprehensive review of MPAs status and existing MEEs in China. We found that despite the significant increase in the number and coverage of China's MPAs, their conservation effectiveness might be impacted by the lack of systematic planning, adequate funding, appropriate zoning, long-term monitoring, and sound laws. Major challenges to the evaluation of MPA management effectiveness in China include the lack of a standardized framework, limited survey data, financial support, and public engagement. To address these challenges, we developed a comprehensive framework based on the common objectives of China's MPAs and existing MEE frameworks. We also recommend based on the developed framework: 1) establishing long-term monitoring pilots in national MPAs; 2) providing sustained funding support for MEE, monitoring and capacity building from government, social capital, and ecotourism; and 3) promoting public participation in MPA management and evaluation through advocacy, incentive mechanisms, and establishment of committees. Adopting our recommendations can strengthen adaptive management and provide new insights into evidence-based decision-making for MPAs in China. ]"

Estimation of corresponding annual gross and net fluxes of SPM and Cd are provided. Estuarine Cd storage decreases by decades from 43t in 1990s to 13t in 2010s. Intra-estuarine sedimentary dynamics act as long-term sources/sinks of stored Cd. Remediation efforts are still required to achieve intra-estuarine background level. , Despite the effective remediation efforts following the end of the metallurgic activity thirty years ago upstream the Lot River watershed , the levels of cadmium (Cd) accumulated in wild oysters from the downstream Gironde Estuary still exceed nowadays the admissible human consumption limit (5 mg/kg, d.w.). The main goal of this work is to quantify the role of sediments as long-term intra-estuarine sources or sinks of Cd and the transport of this contaminant towards the estuary mouth taking as case study the example of the highly turbid Gironde Estuary. The original estimation for the annual net fluxes of the suspended particulate matter ( F net SPM year ) F net SPM year ) and particulate Cd ( F net Cdp year F net Cdp year ) presented in this work between 1990 and 2020 indicates that 80% of the Cd discharged into the ocean is in dissolved form (Cd d ). The values of F net Cdp year F net Cdp year vary proportionally to those of F net SPM year F net SPM year and ranged between 0.1 and 1.4 t/y, with a ten-year average decreasing from 0.8 to 0.6 t/y for the past 30 years. The differences between ten-year total (Cd p + Cd d ) gross and net fluxes show that Cd has effectively been stored in estuarine sediments . This Cd storage was of about 43, 22 and 13 t for the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s, respectively. However, during years of low gross fluxes, estuarine sediments act as additional, secondary sources of bio-available/dissolved Cd into the water column, potentially relating to the continued observations of high Cd concentrations in wild oysters at the estuary mouth. In addition to the natural solubility of Cd p along the salinity and turbidity gradients of the estuary, natural and anthropogenic remobilization of bottom sediment particles further contribute to its mobilization from the particle phase, along with other numerous inorganic/organic pollutants. The mass balances presented in this work could support a new sediment management policy potentially more beneficial to the estuarine ecosystem . ]"

Its circulation is complex, with a zonal Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) interacting with a meridional thermohaline circulation. The ACC is a highly variable, deep-reaching eastward flow driven mainly by the westerly winds. It is the longest (24,000 km), largest (transport 137–147.10 6 m 3 s −1 ) and only current to connect the major oceans. The Ekman component of the westerly winds also drives surface waters north. Near the ACC's northern limit, these waters sink to form Subantarctic Mode and Antarctic Intermediate waters , which continue north at depths &lt;∼1,400 m. Interacting with the ACC is the density-forced thermohaline circulation. Super cooling and increased salinity of shelf waters off the Weddell, Wilkes Land and Ross coasts cause these waters to sink and flow equatorwards. The densest component, Antarctic Bottom Water , is captured in deep basins around Antarctica. Less dense water is entrained by the ACC and mixed with deep water moving south from the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. The resultant Lower Circumpolar Deep Water is tapped off by deep western boundary currents that enter the three oceans at depths &gt;∼2,000 m. These northward inflows, with a total volume transport of ∼55.10 6 m 3 s −1 , disperse Antarctic and northern-sourced waters throughout the world ocean. Other circulation elements are the deep-reaching, cyclonic Weddell, Ross and unnamed gyres located south of the ACC. Further south again are the westward Antarctic Slope and Coastal currents that pass along the Antarctic continental margin under easterly polar winds. ]"

This paper discusses the facies proportions and preservation of the Last Interglacial and Holocene transgressive systems tracts in the Netherlands and their applicability as a North Sea Basin analogue for the Early Jurassic Åre Formation in the Norwegian offshore. New and existing data from both (sub-)modern transgressive Rhine records were thoroughly reviewed from a sequence stratigraphic perspective, before volumetrics were calculated and longitudinal trends quantified at reservoir scale. Large differences between the Last Interglacial and Holocene transgressive systems were found: the volume of fluvial deposits is almost six times larger and the volume of organics nearly twenty times larger in the Holocene record than in the Last Interglacial record. In contrast, the volume of estuarine deposits in the Holocene record is only half of that of the Last Interglacial record. Remarkably, both records show similar averaged sediment-trapping rates of 8–9 km 3 /ka. Initial valley configuration and relative sea-level rise-rates during both transgressions were key controls on the volume and spatial arrangement of the transgressive deposits. Relative sea-level fall and river avulsion determined what amount of sediment was left preserved after completion of one interglacial-glacial cycle. Comparison of the Late Quaternary Rhine records with the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic Åre Formation in the Heidrun Field off mid-Norway, showed the potential of the (sub-)modern Rhine records as analogues for ancient stratigraphic records . Especially the transgressive Rhine sequence from the Last Interglacial provided remarkable similarities in facies proportions, preservability, autogenic processes and controlling forcings, ranging from metre-scale vertical-successions to kilometre-scale field-wide events for parts of the Åre Formation. The side-by-side availability of the truncated Last Interglacial and (still) fully preserved Holocene transgressive system proved to be an excellent natural laboratory to study the stratigraphic architecture and assess depositional trends and preservability over longer time scales (&gt;100 ka). It nevertheless demonstrates that no ‘one-size-fits-all’ analogue exists, but that various other analogues are needed to solve the complex puzzle which the Åre Formation resembles. ]"

Pressures on wetlands are likely to further intensify in the coming decades due to increased global demand for land and water, and due to climate change. Stakeholders at all levels of governance have to be involved to slow, stop and reverse these processes. However, the information they need on wetland extent, their ecological character, and their ecosystem services is often scattered, sparse and difficult to find and access. The freely available Sentinel satellite data of the Copernicus Programme , as well as the Landsat archive, provide a comprehensive basis to map and inventory wetland areas (extent), to derive information on the ecological status, as well as long- and short-term trends in wetland characteristics. However, making use of these Earth Observation (EO) resources for robust and standardized wetland monitoring requires expert knowledge on often complex data processing techniques, which impedes practical implementation.

Modifying the physical system to create and restore natural processes and habitats relies on successfully applying Ecohydrology , where suitable physical conditions, especially hydrography and sedimentology , are created to recover estuarine ecology by natural or human-mediated colonisation of primary producers and consumers, or habitat creation. This successional process then allows wading birds and fish to reoccupy the rehabilitated areas, thus restoring the natural food web and recreating nursery areas for aquatic biota. We describe Ecohydrology principles applied during Ecoengineering restoration projects in Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa and North America. These show some successful and sustainable approaches but also others that were less than successful and not sustainable despite the best of intentions (and which may even have harmed the ecology). Some schemes may be ‘good for the ecologists’, as conservationists consider it successful that at least some habitat was created, albeit in the short-term, but arguably did little for the overall ecology of the area in space or time. We indicate the trade-offs between the short- and long-term value of restored and created ecosystems, the success at developing natural structure and functioning in disturbed estuaries, the role of this in estuarine and wetland management, and the costs and benefits of Ecoengineering to the socio-ecological system.

The composition of zooplankton communities in AO and SO polynyas is largely dependent upon advection from local, ice-covered waters, with little evidence of an endemic, polynya zooplankton fauna. While copepods are common in both systems, a major difference is the predominance of euphausiids in the SO and appendicularian tunicates in the AO. The same genera of small copepods occur in both the AO and SO and appear to derive little benefit from the higher primary productivity and extended growing season of polynyas. In contrast, larger calanoid copepods appear to derive recruitment and life cycle benefits from the diatom production and heat in polynyas, with higher egg production rates and shorter generation times. Most large calanoid copepods overwinter in diapause in AO polynyas, while some proportion of SO populations remain in surface waters. Grazing impact by copepods in AO polynyas accounts for about 20% of primary productivity d −1 , with appendicularian tunicates accounting for another 20% d −1 . The few estimates of community impact in the SO are variable. In both regions, individual zooplankton feeding rates are high and equivalent to boreal ocean values; thus, grazing impact depends primarily on the biomass of zooplankton and phytoplankton . SO zooplankton contribute to the vertical particulate flux through faecal pellets from euphausiids, copepods and pteropods, while the contribution in AO polynyas is primarily through appendicularian tunicate faecal pellets and shed houses and copepod faeces. Maximum pellet flux in both the AO and SO occurs at times of high biomass of diatoms. The primary benefits of polar polynyas to zooplankton processes results from the greater production of diatoms and extended productive period, with few differences in individual daily rations or food web transfer efficiencies relative to temperate and boreal systems. ]"

Studies are needed to determine community effects of loss of tidewater glaciers. , Approximately 60% of Svalbard's land areas are glaciated at the present time. The Archipelago has more than 1100 glaciers (&gt; 1 km 2 ) and 163 of these are “tidewater glaciers” — that is glaciers that terminate (with their calving front) at the sea. It has been known for a long time that these glacier front areas are important feeding areas for seabirds and marine mammals . Herein, we review current knowledge regarding the importance of these areas for these animals and reflect upon the processes that create these apparent “hotspots”. Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla , routinely dominate avian assemblages in front of glaciers in Svalbard, but fulmars Fulmarus glacialis , ivory gulls Pagophila eburnea and glaucous gulls Larus hyperboreus also contribute to aggregations, which can sometimes comprise many thousands of individuals. The birds are often found in the so-called “brown zone”, which is an area in front of tidewater glaciers that is ice-free due to currents and muddy due to suspended sediments . Animals at these sites typically have their stomachs full of large zooplankton or fish. These brown zones are also foraging hotspots for Svalbard's ringed seals ( Pusa hispida ) and white whales ( Delphinapterus leucas ). Prime breeding habitat for ringed seals in Svalbard occurs deep in the fjords where ice pieces calved from the glacier fronts become frozen into land-fast sea-ice, promoting the accumulation of snow to a depth suitable for ringed seal females to dig out birth lairs above breathing holes in the ice. These pupping areas are important hunting areas for polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ) in spring, especially female bears with cubs of the year during the period following emergence from the winter/birthing den. Glacier-ice pieces floating in coastal areas are also important for all seal species in the region as dry platforms during moulting and also as general resting platforms for both birds and seals. During the last decade there have been several years with a complete lack of spring sea ice in many of the fjords along the west coast of Spitsbergen. During the spring periods in these years, bearded seals ( Erignathus barbatus ) have replaced their regular sea-ice platform with glacier ice, using it as a solid substrate for both birthing and nursing as well as general resting. The mechanisms that create foraging hotspots at the fronts of tidewater glaciers are related to the massive subsurface plumes of freshwater discharged from the glacier fronts. As these plumes rise towards the surface they entrain large volumes of ambient water, tens to hundreds of times the original discharge volume. This water is drawn from all depth levels as the plume ascends. This entrainment ensures a continuous resupply of intermediate depth waters from the outer parts of the fjords towards the glacier front and greatly amplifies the general estuarine circulation . The intermediate water masses carry plankton from a broad area, including the outer fjord, into the glacier front area, where they get entrained in the plume rising towards the surface, and often become stunned or die from freshwater osmotic shock . These small animals fall as an easy prey to the surface feeding predators. Large, strong swimming marine zooplankton species can sometimes escape by swimming below the inflow of marine water. But, they then become concentrated in a water layer near the bottom, making them of interest and susceptible to predators. The intermediate water masses also bring nutrients towards the glacier fronts where they are transported up to the surface layer where they can subsequently be utilized for post-bloom primary production. However, this tends to have greatest influence some distance away from the glacier front, when much of the outflow sediment has settled out. Currently, the mass balance for Svalbard glaciers is negative and climate change predictions for the future suggest continued warming, and hence continued glacial retreat. This will result in a reduction in both the number of glaciers calving into the ocean in Svalbard and the total length of calving fronts around the Archipelago. Similar to the retraction of the northern sea-ice edge (which is another diminishing foraging hotspot for these same arctic vertebrates), the climate-warming-induced changes in glaciers will likely lead to substantial distributional shifts and abundance reductions for many arctic species. ]"

However, despite extensive exploration activities, the region remains a conundrum, with mature outcropping exploration plays juxtaposed with largely unexplored, extensive areas of post-mineral cover. This scenario offers exciting mineral exploration opportunities in the highly prospective and well-endowed, but locally concealed, metallogenic belts of northern Chile. Conventional exploration of local vast gravel plains or ignimbrite cover in northern Chile are hindered by the ineffectiveness of traditional geochemical techniques in covered settings and the commonly uneconomical costs associated with the systematic use of geophysics and extensive grid drilling. Porphyry deposits of the Atacama region have served as a test case for the use and testing of the effectiveness of hydrogeochemistry and isotopic vectoring in base metal exploration, with a comprehensive set of mineral exploration case studies, including examples of porphyry, epithermal and strata-bound deposits in Chile. Despite previous pilot studies, hydrogeochemistry remains a tool underutilized tool by many explorers, presumably due to a perception that sampling is challenging and laborious, and that data interpretation is intricate and complicated. Here we present a compilation of historical and current case studies to provide an overview of the most likely solute sources and sinks in the hyper-arid Atacama Desert as well as the resulting potential hydrogeochemical signatures that can be expected and their interpretation. The objective of this study is to provide a guide for the interpretation of hydrogeochemical exploration datasets. ]"

Increasing trends of slope movements observed not satisfactorily explained by climate Strong sedimentation increase in most regions and all kinds of sedimentation environments. Increases described, particularly clear since mid-20th century, respond to land surface changes. A global “great geomorphic acceleration” is taking place and characterizes the Anthropocene. , The effects of human activity on geomorphic processes , particularly those related to denudation/sedimentation, are investigated by reviewing case studies and global assessments covering the past few centuries. Evidence we have assembled from different parts of the world, as well as from the literature, show that certain geomorphic processes are experiencing an acceleration, especially since the mid-twentieth century. This suggests that a global geomorphic change is taking place, largely caused by anthropogenic landscape changes. Direct human-driven denudation (through activities involving excavation, transport, and accumulation of geological materials) has increased by a factor of 30 between 1950 and 2015, representing a ten-fold increase of per capita effect. Direct plus indirectly human-induced denudation (triggered by land surface alteration) is presently at least one order of magnitude greater than denudation due to purely natural processes. The activity of slope movements, which represent an important contribution to denudation, sediment generation and landscape evolution , also shows a clear intensification. Frequency of hazardous events and disasters related to slope movements (an indirect measure of process frequency) in specific regions, as well as at continental and global levels, has grown considerably, in particular after the mid-twentieth century. Intense rainstorm events are often related to slope movement occurrence, but the general increasing trend observed is not satisfactorily explained by climate. Sedimentation has augmented considerably in most regions and all kinds of sedimentation environments. Although the link between denudation and sedimentation is not direct and unequivocal, it is safe to assume that if sedimentation rates increase in different regions during a given period, denudation must have increased too, even though their magnitudes could be different. This augmentation, particularly marked from the second half of the last century onwards, appears to be determined mainly by land surface changes, in conjunction with climate change. The changes observed suggest: a) there is evidence at a global scale of a growing response of geomorphic systems to socio-economic drivers, being Gross Domestic Product density, a good indicator of the human potential to cause such impacts; b) Land use/cover changes enhance effects of climate change on global denudation/sedimentation and landslide/flood frequency, and appear to be a stronger controlling factor; c) Our findings point to the existence of a global geomorphic change. This manifestation of global change is especially evident since the “great geomorphic acceleration” that began in the middle of the 20th century, and constitutes one of the characteristics of the proposed Anthropocene . ]"

Both of the observations and model results show that, in spring, the average BC concentration and the resulting radiative forcing in Russian Arctic &gt; Canadian and Alaskan Arctic &gt; Arctic Ocean and Greenland. The observed BC concentration presented a significant decrease trend from the Arctic coastal regions to the center of Arctic Ocean. In summer, due to the combined effects of BC accumulation and enlarged snow grain size, the averaged radiative forcing per unit area over the Arctic Ocean is larger than that over each sector of the Arctic in spring. However, because summer sea ice is always covered by a large fraction of melt ponds, the role of BC in sea ice albedo evolution during this period is secondary. Multi-model mean results indicate that the annual mean radiative forcing from all sources of BC in snow and ice over the Arctic was ∼0.17 W m −2 . Wet deposition is the dominant removal mechanism in the Arctic, which accounts for more than 90% of the total deposition.

Isopycnal advection and bacterial respiration would strengthen the intensity of OML. Deep water spreading and local mixing would affect the intermediate and deep waters. , Dissolved oxygen (O 2 ) is a relevant tracer to interpret variations of both water mass properties in the open ocean and biological production in the surface layer of both coastal and open waters. Deep-water formation is very active in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, where it influences intermediate and deep waters properties, nutrients replenishment and biological production. This study analyses, for the first time, the 20-year time series of monthly O 2 concentrations at the DYFAMED long-term sampling site in the Ligurian Sea. Until the winters of 2005 and 2006, a thick and strong oxygen minimum layer was present between 200 and 1300 m because dense water formation was then local, episodic and of low intensity. In 2005–2006, intense and rapid deep convection injected 24 mol O 2 m −2 between 350 and 2000 m from December 2005 to March 2006. Since this event, the deep layer has been mostly ventilated during winter time by newly formed deep water spreading from the Gulf of Lion 250 km to the west and by some local deep mixing in early 2010, 2012 and 2013. In the context of climate change, it is predicted that the intensity of deep convection will become weaker in the Mediterranean, which could potentially lead to hypoxia in intermediate and deep layers with substantial impact on marine ecosystems. With the exception of winters 2005 and 2006, the O 2 changes in surface waters followed a seasonal trend that reflected the balance between air-sea O 2 exchanges, changes in the depth of the mixed layer and phytoplankton net photosynthesis. We used the 20-year O 2 time series to estimate monthly and annual net community production. The latter was 7.1 mol C m −2 yr −1 , consistent with C-14 primary production determinations and sediment-trap carbon export fluxes at DYFAMED. ]"

In the first part, the rationale for moving from an atmospheric stabilisation target to an average surface temperature target is explained. This is followed by a discussion of the IPCC’s representations of nonlinear behaviour in relation to climate forcing, and the problems associated with using a single temperature target in assessing climate risk. An outline is then provided of efforts to define what can or should constitute physical, biological and socio-economic indicators of dangerous anthropogenic interference (DAI). The paper reviews the IPCC’s representations of sea-level rise to illustrate the argument that it continues to take insufficient account of the paleoclimate record and improved methods of modelling. Part 1 concludes by arguing that the IPCC continues to under-represent the risks associated with DAI. In the second part, the rationale and methodologies for reconfiguring international climate governance are discussed in more detail. Part 2 argues that the currently dominant model of international policymaking is primarily an outcome of compromises made by governments under pressure from powerful polluting industries and their business allies. It is argued that the political economy of international climate governance has produced systematic biases in the kinds of expertise and evidence that national governments deem appropriate for consideration via the IPCC and UNFCCC frameworks, along with the relative importance that is ascribed to them. Drawing on the research of climate scientists and social scientists, some suggestions for how to restructure and refocus the activities of the IPCC, UNFCCC and climate governance more generally are canvassed, including the necessity of creating far more interdisciplinary and democratically accountable structures of expertise for climate policy-making at the national and supra-national levels.

Rice paddy cultivation results in accumulations of nutrients exceeding life span. Soil management adjusted to match landscape positions significantly influences PSE. Chronosequence approach allows investigating phases, rates, and thresholds of PSE. We highlight future research priorities for quantitative models of PSE. , Chronosequences and associated space-for-time substitutions are an important and fruitful means for investigating the rates and directions of soil and ecosystem evolution across multiple time-scales ranging from decades to millions of years. This paper reviews the use of chronosequences for studying biogeochemistry of paddy soil evolution to improve our understanding of the fundamental processes, the dynamic changes in soil properties and the associated environmental thresholds at different stages of paddy soil evolution under the intensive anthropogenic managements. Rice paddy cultivation results in accumulations of various nutrients (e.g. organic carbon , nitrogen, and phosphorus) over a much longer time period than predicted by typical long-term (&lt; 50 years) field experiments, although it is not clear how long it takes paddy soils with different origins to reach a steady-state of these important nutrients. Extensive investigations of a 2000-year paddy soil chronosequence derived from calcareous marine sediments in the coastal region of Zhejiang Province (P.R. China) illustrate three phases of paddy soil evolution and the associated pedogenic thresholds: an initial phase during the first few decades dominated by rapid desalinization , loss of magnetic susceptibility , accumulation of topsoil organic matter and formation of a compacted plow pan due to extrinsic thresholds resulting from anthropogenic activities ; the second phase lasts several centuries comprising Fe and clay enrichment in the illuvial horizon, and the loss of phosphorus and Mn coincident with the near complete removal of CaCO 3 (recognized as the intrinsic threshold); in the third phase (&gt; 700 years), (trans-)formation and redistribution of metal oxides are accompanied by clearly visible hydromorphic patterns in paddy subsoils . We also note that after 2000-years, paddy soils still lack evidence of silicate weathering and neo-formation of pedogenic clay minerals. Paddy soil management is adjusted to match landscape positions (e.g. well-drained sloping uplands, alluvial plains with groundwater fluctuation, and poorly drained bog areas with near surface water table) and this influences the trajectory and magnitude of pedogenic changes with prolonged rice cultivation. However, the parent material effects on paddy soil evolution seem to diminish with the lapse of time and vary considerably among different soil properties or processes. Given our universal dependence on paddy soils for food production , their value as an excellent opportunity for investigating anthropedogenesis, and their critical roles in global biogeochemical cycling, we put forward several open questions that must be resolved to maintain the millennial-scale sustainability of these important wetlands . ]"

However, significant advances in scientific thinking, along with logistics and technology for gathering data from the continent itself, were required before a clear and consistent framework for ice-sheet history and behaviour could develop and this has emerged only in the last few years. The main features of the present ice sheet were established by over-snow traverses during and following the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), but the timing and circumstances of its origin remained uncertain. Geological records of post-Jurassic time were largely buried under the ice or the sea floor around the Antarctic margin, though a few radiometric ages from the new K–Ar dating indicated Antarctic glaciation was likely older than the Northern Hemisphere ice ages of the Quaternary Period . New post-World War II techniques in offshore surveying with marine geophysics and ship-based drilling were first applied to the Antarctic margin in the early 1970s, and were immediately productive. The Antarctic continental shelf was found to be underlain by sedimentary basins with the promise of ice-sheet history, and in early 1973, cores from Leg 28 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) in the Ross Sea provided the first physical record of Antarctic glaciation extending back to Oligocene times. DSDP Leg 29 drilled in the Southern Ocean for deep-sea cores from the whole Cenozoic Era , yielding the first set of oxygen isotopic ratios (δ 18 O) from benthic calcareous microfossils , and the first estimates of ice volume. These indicated a two-stage ice-sheet history (cooling and some ice at 34 Ma, and persistent ice from 14 Ma – time-scale of Berggren et al., 1995). About the same time, the Dry Valleys Drilling Project (DVDP) was launched to recover onshore records of Antarctic Cenozoic climate history, and exploratory drilling from fast ice offshore soon followed. Cores from the Ocean Drilling Program in the 1980s from the Prydz Bay Shelf and the Kerguelen Plateau established the timing of the first continental ice sheet at 34 Ma. In the same period, deep continuous coring from sea ice in McMurdo Sound developed from DVDP technology succeeded in providing new detail for its subsequent history. Core recovery at ∼98% yielded lithological evidence of ice margin and sea level fluctuations implied by deep-sea isotope records. Further drilling with improved chronology in the 1990s yielded cores confirming ice margin and sea level changes on Milankovitch frequencies and on a scale of 10–40 m of sea level equivalent. Micropalaeontological and geochemical evidence pointed to a slight cooling from a coastal cold temperate climate , with beech forests during interglacial times. Subsequent development of ice-sheet modelling has indicated that most of the cooling that initiated ice-sheet glaciation was the consequence of a fall in atmospheric CO 2 levels below a critical threshold, allowing ice sheets to form that were highly sensitive to orbital forcing . This claim has been supported by recent work on CO 2 proxies and indicators of a shift in carbonate compensation depth in deep-sea sediments . Since the first measurements in the 1970s, deep-sea isotopic measurements have implied a significant increase in Antarctic ice volume at around 14 Ma that persisted to the present day. However, in the mid-1980s, marine diatoms in glacial deposits in the Transantarctic Mountains suggested periods in Pliocene times when seas invaded the East Antarctic interior, implying dynamic Antarctic Ice Sheets until Quaternary times. Evidence of continued cold in the mountains over the last 14 Ma, glaciological problems with the proposed over-riding scenario, lack of a signal in the deep-sea isotope record for the loss of most Antarctic ice in Pliocene times and possible alternative atmospheric sources for diatoms has shifted the weight of evidence in favour of persistent ice in the east Antarctic interior. However, coastal outcrops in Prydz Bay and a recent deep core from beneath the McMurdo Ice Shelf have shown that in the globally warmer Pliocene, notably around 3–5 Ma, seas around the Antarctic margin were several degrees warmer. Indeed, recent drill cores suggest that the Ross Embayment and perhaps also most of the West Antarctic interior were periodically ice-free in these times. Three decades ago, the Antarctic Ice Sheet was seen as a long-standing feature of the Earth with its origins in early Cenozoic times and its permanency assured by mid-Miocene cooling. Research in the last decade from geological drilling and glaciological remote sensing , supported by ice sheet and climate modelling, indicates the ice sheet is in fact quite responsive to changes in the global climate system, whether natural or human-induced, though at different rates in different sectors. Recent developments in both science and technology outlined here provide opportunities for projecting realistic scenarios for future ice-sheet response on human time scales. ]"

It presents significant advances in the understanding of the Pleistocene to Holocene developmental history of reefs, as a result of recent investigations of marine sedimentology and ecology, paleobiology , paleobiogeography , coastal paleoceanography , and paleoclimatology of the tropics. Such an approach leads to large-scale spatio-temporal insights into the conditions of reef development at times before the human occupation of reef sites. The geological significance of reef structures increased when it was realized that many major oil fields are in lithological associations with structures that resemble those of recent reefs. Deep drilling, in pursuit of the Royal Society's attempts to prove Darwin's theory of subsidence, has shown that the majority of reef bodies are the cumulative result of deposition accompanying subsidence during the Pleistocene, Pliocene , and in some cases even the Miocene . It has clearly shown that growth has not been continuous and accretion has been punctuated by climatically driven changes in relative sea level. No single phenomenon can satisfactorily account for changes in the patterns of reef distribution and development over time.

Although many plate boundaries worldwide have undergone successive deformation events during one or more Wilson cycles, most often the influence of fault reactivation on mainly the last deformation event can be comprehensively estimated. The northern South China Sea area has undergone, in the last 60 Myr, an entire Wilson cycle associated with the opening and the ongoing closure of the South China Sea oceanic basin. The continental basement that underwent extension during the opening of the South China Sea was associated with at least two, well-defined, systems of faults inherited from the Cretaceous tectonic evolution of the area. Also, the ongoing closure of the northern South China Sea is partial as convergence is highly oblique and collision is very localized and confined to the Taiwan mountain belt, while in most of the Eurasian rifted margin the extensional structures related to the opening of the South China Sea are not yet overprinted. Both these conditions make the northern South China Sea area an ideal one for investigating the significance of fault reactivation throughout the Wilson cycle. In this article, we first review the tectonic history of the northern South China Sea area in the last 60 Myr focusing on how it is reflected on the northern South China Sea rifted margin and the Taiwan mountain belt. We then review the influence that fault reactivation has exerted in these two areas. We found that fault reactivation had a crucial role in accommodating deformation during both the divergence and convergence episodes of the Wilson cycle, and that the degree to which faults are reactivated as well as the style of fault reactivation can be shown to be associated with the angle that inherited faults form with the extension and shortening directions, respectively. Reactivation of faults involving significant remobilisation of basement rocks seems to have been promoted for faults that were forming a high angle with the extension and shortening directions. These results highlight not only the continuous significance that fault reactivation can have during the Wilson cycle undergone at a plate boundary, but also how the first-order, underlying, geometric controls on fault reactivation can display consistency throughout the cycle itself. ]"

Analysis of hydrological data from the study area reveals the presence of five water masses: local surface water and remotely advected Modified Atlantic Water (MAW) share the surface layers below them are Cretan Intermediate Water (CIW), between 50 and 150 dbar, Transition Mediterranean Waters (TMW) with its core located between 300–400 dbar, and the Cretan Deep Waters (CDW) occupying the depths below 800 dbar. The circulation over the coastal shelf and slope is dictated by the offshore semi-permanent mesoscale features that dominated the Cretan Sea in 1994–1995, forcing locally a shoreward flow. The hydrographic observations are verified by current-meter measurements from a mooring in the sampling area. The recorded velocity is generally towards the SE direction, seasonally modulated, reaching maximum speeds of 27 cm s −1 . Analysis of the new data set has revealed a previously unobserved feature of the oceanographic characteristics of the region. Over the base of the Cretan Slope there occur lenses of water that are warmer and more saline than their surroundings. These lenses probably form on the shelf seasonally; their waters are rich in oxygen, and have a density that is higher than historical Cretan Deep Water values. ]"

Existing classifications of marine habitats of the Mediterranean are reviewed. The Barcelona Convention (BC) classification was fully revised and updated. The new classification lists 394 habitat types, adding up 54% new habitats. 267 reference marine habitats were selected for conservation and monitoring. , The Mediterranean Sea supports high levels of biodiversity and complexity but is facing increasing human pressures, so that strategies to protect and recover its ecosystems must be a priority in environmental policies. Benthic cartography represents the first step of marine spatial planning for the proper management and protection of our sea. Univocal habitat classification systems are thus needed to map, monitor, and inventory marine habitats , and to guarantee common and shared frames for a harmonized interpretation of the Mediterranean habitat types. In this paper we reviewed the existing classification systems of marine benthic habitats, to discuss the process of revision and updating of one of the first system developed under the Barcelona Convention (BC) in 1998 and adopted by all the Mediterranean countries. The BC classification was revised including the new habitats discovered in the last 30 years, and consistently with the criteria used to revise the EUropean Nature Information System (EUNIS), which is a comprehensive pan-European system for habitat identification. The updated BC classification is hierarchical with 5 levels, which allows representing the most suitable habitat level with respect to the restitution scale of the map. Each habitat is univocally identified by an alpha-numeric code, name and general description following the bionomic approach traditionally adopted in the Mediterranean benthic cartography since the late nineteen century. The new BC classification lists 128 main habitats up to the level 4, which may also contain sub-habitats at the level 5, i.e. associations and facies , totalising 394 habitat types (54% of new habitats with respect to the first BC classification). The updated BC classification system has been used for the selection of reference marine habitats that support two fundamental processes of environmental management: i) identification of Specially Marine Protected Areas according to the SPA/BD Protocol of Barcelona Convention; ii) selection of habitats to be monitored, as requested by the Integrated Monitoring and Assessment Programme and the European Directives (e.g., Water Framework and Marine Strategy). The new list of reference habitats, selected because of their high ecological and conservation value, contains 267 habitats, corresponding to 68% of the total habitats listed in the updated BC classification. ]"

Despite the small fraction, some of the most devastating cyclones have formed in this basin, causing extensive damage to the life and property in the north Indian Ocean rim countries. In this review article, we highlight the advancement in research in terms of ocean-atmosphere interaction during cyclones in the north Indian Ocean and identify the gap areas where our understanding is still lacking. There is a two-way ocean-atmosphere interaction during cyclones in the north Indian Ocean. High sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of magnitude 28–29 °C and above provide favorable conditions for the genesis and evolution of cyclones in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. On the other hand, cyclones induce cold and salty wakes. Cyclone induced cooling depends on the translation speed of the cyclone, wind power input, ocean stratification, and the subsurface conditions dictated by the ocean eddies, mixed layer, and the barrier layer in the north Indian Ocean. The average cyclone-induced SST cooling is 2–3 °C during the pre-monsoon season and 0.5–1 °C during the post-monsoon season. This varying ocean response to cyclones in the two seasons in the Bay of Bengal is due to the difference in the ocean haline stratification, whereas, in the Arabian Sea, it is due to the difference in cyclone wind power input and ocean thermal stratification. The oceanic response to cyclone is asymmetric due to the asymmetry in the cyclone wind stress, cyclone induced rainfall and the dynamics of the ocean inertial currents. The cyclone induced wake is salty and is the saltiest in the Bay of Bengal among all the ocean basins. The physical response of the ocean to the cyclone is accompanied by a biological response also, as cyclones induce large chlorophyll blooms in the north Indian Ocean that last from several days to weeks. SSTs leading to cyclogenesis in the Arabian Sea are 1.2–1.4 °C higher in recent decades, compared to SSTs four decades ago. Rapid warming in the north Indian Ocean, associated with global warming, tends to enhance the heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere and favor rapid intensification of cyclones. Monitoring and forecasting rapid intensification is a challenge, particularly due to gaps in in-situ ocean observations. Changes in ocean-cyclone interactions are emerging in recent decades in response to Indian Ocean warming, and are to be closely monitored with improved observations since future climate projections demonstrate continued warming of the Indian Ocean at a rapid pace along with an increase in the intensity of cyclones in this basin. ]"

Flare up magmas are chiefly sourced from the continental mantle lithosphere. Melting of refertilized mantle lithosphere can explain high magmatic addition rates. Flare ups in continental arcs coincide with landward arc migration. Episodic arc migration may be related to slab dynamics. , Continental arcs in Cordilleran orogenic systems display episodic changes in magma production rate, alternating between flare ups (70–90 km 3 km −1 Myr −1 ) and lulls (&lt; 20 km 3 km −1 Myr −1 ) on timescales of tens of millions of years. Arc segments or individual magmatic suites may have even higher rates, up several 100 s of km 3 km −1 Myr −1 , during flare ups. These rates are largely determined by estimating volumes of arc crust, but do not reflect melt production from the mantle. The bulk of mantle-derived magmas are recycled back into the mantle by delamination of arc roots after differentiation in the deep crust. Mantle-derived melt production rates for continental arcs are estimated to be 140–215 km 3 km −1 Myr −1 during flare ups and ≤ 15 km 3 km −1 Myr −1 during lulls. Melt production rates averaged over multiple magmatic cycles are consistent with independent estimates for partial melting of the mantle wedge in subduction zones , however, the rates during flare ups and lulls are both anomalously high and anomalously low, respectively. The difference in mantle-derived melt production between flare ups and lulls is larger than predicted by petrologic and numerical models that explore the range of globally observed subduction parameters (e.g., convergence rate, height of the mantle wedge). This suggests that other processes are required to increase magmatism during flare ups and suppress magmatism during lulls. There are many viable explanations, but one possibility is that crystallized melts from the asthenospheric mantle wedge are temporarily stored in the deep lithosphere during lulls and then remobilized during flare ups. Basaltic melts may stall in the mantle lithosphere in inactive parts of the arc system, like the back-arc, refertilizing the mantle lithosphere and suppressing melt delivery to the lower crust . Subsequent landward arc migration (i.e., toward the interior of the continent) may encounter such refertilized mantle lithosphere magma source regions, contributing to magmatic activity during a flare up. A review of continental arcs globally suggests that flare ups commonly coincide with landward arc migration and that this migration may start tens of millions of years before the flare up occurs. The region of magmatic activity, or arc width, can also expand significantly during a flare up. Arc migration or expansion into different mantle source regions and across lithospheric and crustal boundaries can cause temporal shifts in the radiogenic isotopic composition of magmatism. In the absence of arc migration, temporal shifts are more muted. Isotopic studies of mantle xenoliths and exposures of deep arc crust suggest that that primary, mantle-derived magmas generated during flare ups reflect substantial contributions from the subcontinental mantle lithosphere. Arc migration may be caused by a variety of mechanisms, including slab anchoring or slab folding in the mantle transition zone that could generate changes in slab dip. Episodic slab shallowing is associated with many tectonic processes in Cordilleran orogenic systems, like alternations between shortening and extension in the upper plate. Studies of arc migration may help to link irregular magmatic production in continental arcs with geodynamic models for orogenic cyclicity . ]"

This review is a synthesis of recent developments in pedology of RF soils. The formation of Oxisols from Ultisols is an improbable genetic pathway. This review has resolved many enigmatic pedological and edaphological issues. , Red ferruginous (RF) soils of tropical Indian environments belong to Entisols , Inceptisols , Alfisols , Mollisols and Ultisols soil orders. The occurrence of Ultisols alongside acidic Alfisols and Mollisols in both zeolitic and non-zeolitic parent materials in humid tropical (HT) climatic environments, indicates that the soil diversity in India is large. These soils are not confined to a single production system and generally maintain a positive organic carbon (OC) balance without adding significantly to greenhouse gas emissions . This review presents a synthesis of literature on the recent developments on the pedology of RF soils, including their physical, chemical, biological, mineralogical and micro-morphological properties, and their degradation status. It also addresses the changes in soil properties in semi-arid tropical (SAT) areas, created by climate shift during the Holocene . This knowledge contributed to our understanding as to how the parent material composition influences the formation of Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols in weathering environments of HT climate; and also as to how the relict Alfisols of SAT areas are polygenetic. The state-of-the-art information developed through the extensive work on such soils has helped establish an organic link between pedogenetic processes and bulk soil properties, and has provided an insight of many pedological and edaphological issues related to Alfisols, Mollisols and Ultisols mainly of HT climate. The synthesis has helped us to understand as to why the formation of Oxisols from Ultisols is an improbable genetic pathway in tropical environment of India and elsewhere in the world. There is a strong need to modify the mineralogy class of highly weathered RF soils. We hope this review will help to dispel some of the myths on the formation of tropical soils and their low fertility by putting in context their characteristics and capacity to be productive. ]"

However, the Late Cretaceous tectonic evolution of the South China Sea area is yet to be clearly defined, and it is at present largely debated in the literature. In this paper, mainly on the basis of ~240,000 km 2 newly acquired 3D seismic reflection data, 94 industrial wells and existing U Pb ages of basement granitoids, we carried out an integrated interpretation, mapping and analysis of the pre-Cenozoic (&gt; 66 Ma) structures within the basement of the Cenozoic rift basin in the northern South China Sea area, that can be crucial for a broad understanding of the Late Cretaceous tectonic evolution of this region. Results of this analysis suggest that three Late Cretaceous fault systems can be identified in the northern South China Sea margin: 1) the WNW-striking thrust system, 2) ENE-striking extensional fault system, and 3) ENE-striking thrust system. These three fault systems are considered to have developed in the Late Cretaceous since they are superimposed on the well dated Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (161.6–101.7 Ma) arc-related granitoids that define most of the basement of the Cenozoic rift basin within the study area. This new structural evidence, combined with a review of previous studies, led us to propose a renewed multi-phase geodynamic evolutionary model of the South China Sea area during the Late Cretaceous. The first tectonic event that can be recognized generated the WNW-striking thrust system and is, in this paper, interpreted to have formed as a result of a sinistral transpressional event that took place in the South China Sea area and adjacent areas around 100 Ma at the Early-Late Cretaceous boundary. This transpressional event was likely related to intense oblique convergence between the Paleo-Pacific Ocean Plate and the Eurasia Plate . The second tectonic phase that was identified in this paper (~100 Ma to ~72 Ma) is defined by an extensional event that generated the largely ENE-striking extensional fault systems and associated basins, which is interpreted to be related to the back-arc extension that took place in this period in response to the slab roll back and high-angle subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. This extensional phase eventually led to the opening of the Proto-South China Sea on the SE margin of the proto-South China Block, and it should be distinguished from the Cenozoic rifting phases that are related to the opening of the South China Sea. The third and last tectonic phase that was recognized in this paper is a compressional event that took place in the late stage of the Late Cretaceous (~72 Ma to ~66 Ma) and was responsible for the development of the ENE-striking thrust system. We suggest that this post-subduction (post-Yanshanian) compressional event can be interpreted to have developed in response to process of ridge push related to the sea floor spreading of the Proto-South China Sea. ]"

Numerous studies have reported the occurrence of PPE in the marine environment. However, their degradation in the environment and consequences are poorly understood. Studies have reported that face masks, the most abundant type of PPE, are significant sources of microplastics due to their fibrous microstructure. The fibrous material (mostly consisting of polypropylene) exhibits physical changes in the environment, leading to its fracture and detachment of microfibers . Most studies have evaluated PPE degradation under controlled laboratory conditions. However, in situ degradation experiments, including the colonization of PPE, are largely lacking.

884,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825212001535,[ Differential preservation in the geologic record of intraoceanic arc sedimentary and tectonic processes ],"[ Records of ancient intraoceanic arc activity, now preserved in continental suture zones , are commonly used to reconstruct paleogeography and plate motion, and to understand how continental crust is formed, recycled, and maintained through time. However, interpreting tectonic and sedimentary records from ancient terranes after arc–continent collision is complicated by preferential preservation of evidence for some arc processes and loss of evidence for others. In this synthesis we examine what is lost, and what is preserved, in the translation from modern processes to the ancient record of intraoceanic arcs. Composition of accreted arc terranes differs as a function of arc–continent collision geometry. ‘Forward-facing’ collision can accrete an oceanic arc on to either a passive or an active continental margin , with the arc facing the continent and colliding trench- and forearc-side first. In a ‘backward-facing’ collision, involving two subduction zones with similar polarity, the arc collides backarc-first with an active continental margin. The preservation of evidence for contemporary sedimentary and tectonic arc processes in the geologic record depends greatly on how well the various parts of the arc survive collision and orogeny in each case. Preservation of arc terranes likely is biased towards those that were in a state of tectonic accretion for tens of millions of years before collision, rather than tectonic erosion. The prevalence of tectonic erosion in modern intraoceanic arcs implies that valuable records of arc processes are commonly destroyed even before the arc collides with a continent. Arc systems are most likely to undergo tectonic accretion shortly before forward-facing collision with a continent, and thus most forearc and accretionary-prism material in ancient arc terranes likely is temporally biased toward the final stages of arc activity, when sediment flux to the trench was greatest and tectonic accretion prevailed. Collision geometry and tectonic erosion vs. accretion are important controls on the ultimate survival of material from the trench, forearc, arc massif , intra-arc basins, and backarc basins , and thus on how well an ancient arc terrane preserves evidence for tectonic processes such as subduction of aseismic ridges and seamounts , oblique plate convergence , and arc rifting. Forward-facing collision involves substantial recycling, melting, and fractionation of continent-derived material during and after collision, and so produces melts rich in silica and incompatible trace elements. As a result, forward-facing collision can drive the composition of accreted arc crust toward that of average continental crust. ]"

Conceptual models communicate understanding to politicians, decision makers and the general public. , The Arctic Ocean is overwhelmingly forced by its lateral boundaries, and interacts with, the global system. For the development of nested conceptual models of the Arctic Ocean ecosystem we here choose the full pan-Arctic as our focal scale. Understanding the pan-Arctic scale, however, requires that we look at the underlying scales of its major components, by considering regionality, connectivity and seasonality . Six regions are identified on the basis of hydro-morphological characteristics, which subsequently reflect ecological function and traits. Regions are static, tied to geography, but are linked by contiguous domains of shared function that facilitate material transports and share key ecological features. The pan-Arctic scale also requires attention to forcing by the seasonal light intensity , wherein the maximum length of a single day varies from near 24 h at the Arctic Circle to about 4400 h (183 days) at the North Pole. The light climate forces a strong phenology in the Arctic, as reflected in the periodic life cycle events of organisms. In addition to light climate, Arctic Ocean ecosystems are dominated by three fundamental variables: ice cover, nutrient/food availability and advection . The conditions under which each of these variables play out in the course of a year are set by the regions and contiguous domains within which they operate and interact. Together, the defined regions and their seasonality, the contiguous domains and their connectivity, and the three fundamental variables allow unambiguous application of scale-nested, parsimonious and adaptive, conceptual models, from which to 1) create testable hypotheses, 2) plan and then modify field campaigns, and 3) communicate essential results to managers and the general public. The development of these nested conceptual pan-Arctic scale models creates a vital step into the future of unifying, integrative oceanographic and ecological work. ]"

Models and hypotheses on the formation of radial orbicular textures ]","[ Highlights Super-heated depolymerized magma induced by high influx of water-rich liquids Volatile exsolution and crystallization under undercooling conditions: spherulitic textures Instantaneous geochemical and physical fractionation: two sub-systems separation Simultaneous matrix-outer shell crystallization: oikocrystals growth , The orbicular granitoid of Caldera , located at the northern part of the Chilean Coastal Range, is a spectacular example of radial textures in orbicular structures. The orbicular body crops out as a 375 m 2 tabular to lensoidal intrusive sheet emplaced in the Lower Jurassic Relincho pluton . The orbicular structures are 3–7 cm in diameter ellipsoids hosted in a porphyritic matrix. The orbicules are comprised by a Qtz-dioritic core (3–5 cm in diameter) composed by Pl + Hbl + Qtz + Bt ± Kfs with equiaxial textures and a gabbroic shell (2–3 cm in diameter) characterized by feathery and radiate textures with a plagioclase + hornblende paragenesis . The radial shell crystals are rooted and orthogonally disposed in the irregular contact with the core. The radial shell, called here inner shell, is in contact with the granodioritic equiaxial interorbicular matrix through a 2–3 mm wide poikilitic band around the orbicule (outer shell). The outer shell and the matrix surrounding the orbicules are characterized by the presence of large hornblende and biotite oikocrystals that include fine-grained rounded plagioclase and magnetite . The oikocrystals of both the outer shell and the matrix have a circumferential arrangement around the orbicule, i.e. orthogonal to the radial inner shell. The coarse-grained granodioritic interorbicular matrix present pegmatitic domains with large acicular hornblende and K-feldspar megacrysts. This work presents a review of the textural characteristics of the orbicules and a complete new mineral and whole-rock geochemical study of the different parts of the orbicular granitoid, together with thermobarometric and crystallographic data, and theoretical modeling of the crystallization and element partitioning processes. We propose a model for the formation of the orbicular radial textures consisting of several processes that are suggested to occur fast and consecutively: superheating, volatile exsolution , undercooling, geochemical fractionation and columnar and equiaxial crystallization. According to the obtained results, the formation of the orbicular granitoid of Caldera may have initiated 1) during the generation of a magmatic fracture in the crystallization front of the Relincho pluton, where the water released by the host crystal mush was dissolved in the new batch of dioritic magma . 2) The high influx of water-rich liquids induced superheating conditions in the newly intruding magma that became a depolymerized liquid, where the only solid particules were the small irregular fragments of the host mush dragged from the fracture walls. 3) Volatile exsolution promoted crystallization under undercooling conditions. 4) Undercooling and nucleation around the core (cold germs) involved the physical and geochemical fractionation between two sub-systems: a gabbroic sub-system that comprises the solid paragénesis with a residual water-rich liquid and a granodioritic sub-system. 5) The orbicules, including core and inner shell, behaved as viscous bodies (crystals + residual liquid) floating in the granodioritic magma. 6) Higher undercooling rates occurred at the starting stage, close to the liquidus , promoting columnar crystallization around the cores and formation of the shells. Conversely, in the granodioritic matrix sub-system, equiaxial crystallization was promoted by low relative crystallization rates. 7) The rest of the crystallization process evolved later in the outer shell and the matrix, as suggested by the poikilitic textures observed in both sides of the orbicule contact, and under conditions close to the solidus of both sub-systems (shell and matrix). The water-rich residual liquid expelled during the orbicular shell crystallization was mingled with the partially crystallized matrix magma, generating the pegmatitic domains with large Kfs megacrysts. ]"

The site is located on the southern West Coast of South Africa which represents a passive intraplate, trailing edge setting. The southern African subcontinent is also removed from glacial influence and has experienced no Cenozoic volcanic activity. Rates of vertical crustal motion are consequently low and Late Cenozoic shoreline datums at LBW chiefly reflect glacio-eustatic sea level history. The primary aim of this study is to clarify the chronology as well as the regional and global context of LBW and to review previous work on these aspects. LBW is ideally situated to document the complex interactions of ocean, atmosphere and land and their respective influence on climate evolution, given its location near the coast and mix of marine, estuarine and terrestrial faunas and depositional settings. This paper also provides a background to the study of the vast existing faunal collections and a guide to undiscovered fossil deposits. Towards these ends, the first detailed geological/topographic maps of the site and surrounds, accompanied by a summary stratigraphic column are provided. Virtual geological modelling using a subsurface database has clarified the spatial and temporal relationships of sedimentary facies , as well as their depositional settings. The geological and palaeontological record at LBW tracks and documents the major regional and global climatic/oceanographic events of the Late Cenozoic. During the Oligocene drawdown in sea levels, the landscape was etched by river incision. Fluctuating sea levels of the Neogene periodically reversed the trend from erosion to deposition, preserving contemporary faunas and floras in the Oligocene palaeovalleys. Earlier Miocene pollen from fluvial facies indicates a humid sub-tropical climate, reflecting a warm southern Atlantic Ocean. The abrupt late Middle Miocene global cooling (Monterey Excursion) coincided with intensified cold upwelling in the Benguela Current and extensive phosphate authigenesis . A globally documented Early Pliocene highstand possibly related to the shoaling of the Isthmus of Panama reached ~ 90 m above sea level (asl), implying extensive melting of the cryosphere .

Ichnological features refine previously proposed facies models. Pelagites/hemipelagites and turbidites reveal diagnostic ichnological features. Hyperpycnites and contourites show variability in ichnological properties. Bioturbation reveals as a key to characterize and differentiate deep-sea facies. , ABSTRACT The deep-marine environment is a complex setting in which numerous processes —settling of pelagic and hemipelagic particles in the water column, sediment gravity flows (downslope density currents; turbid flows), and bottom currents— determine sediment deposition, hence a variety of facies including pelagites/hemipelagites, contourites , turbidites and hyperpycnites. Characterization and differentiation among deep-sea facies is a challenge, and numerous features may be highlighted to this end: sedimentary structures , geochemical data, micropaleontological information, etc. Ichnological information has become a valuable, yet in some cases controversial, proxy, being in most of cases understudied. This paper gathers the existing ichnological information regarding the most frequent deep-sea facies —from those in which ichnological analyses are numerous and detailed (e.g. pelagites/hemipelagites and turbidites), to those for which ichnological information is lacking or imprecise (hyperpycnites and contourites). This review analyses palaeoenvironmental (i.e., ecological and depositional) conditions associated with deep-sea sedimentary processes, influence of these changes on the tracemaker community, and associated ichnological properties. A detailed characterization of trace fossil assemblages, ichnofabrics and ichnofacies is presented. Special attention is paid to variations in trace fossil features, approached through sedimentary facies models and the outcrop/core scale. Similarities and differences among deep-sea facies are underlined to facilitate differentiation. Pelagic/hemipelagic sediments are completely bioturbated, showing biodeformational structures and trace fossils, being characterized by composite ichnofabrics. The trace fossil assemblage of muddy pelagites and hemipelagites is mainly assigned to the Zoophycos ichnofacies, and locally to the distal expression of the Cruziana ichnofacies. Turbidites are colonized mostly from the top, determining an uppermost part that is entirely bioturbated, the spotty layer; below it lies the elite layer, characterized by deep-tier trace fossils. Turbidite beds pertain to two different groups of burrows, either “pre-depositional”, mainly graphogliptids, or “post-depositional” traces. Turbidite deposits are mostly characterized by the Nereites ichnofacies, with differentiation of three ichnosubfacies according to the different parts of the turbiditic systems and the associated palaeoenvironmental conditions. There are no major differences in the trace fossil content of the hyperpycnite facies and the classical post-depositional turbidite, nor in the pelagic/hemipelagic sediments, except for a lower ichnodiversity in the hyperpycnites. Trace fossil assemblages of distal hyperpycnites are mainly assigned to the Nereites ichnofacies, while graphogliptids are scarce or absent. Ichnological features vary within contourites, largely related to palaeoenvironmental conditions, depositional setting, and type of contourite. Ichnodiversity and abundance can be high, especially for mud-silty contourites. The ichnological features of mud-silty contourites are similar to those of the pelagic/hemipelagic sediments (the tiering structure probably being more complex in pelagic/hemipelagic) or to the upper part of the muddy turbidites (contourites probably being more continuously bioturbated). No single archetypal ichnofacies would characterize contourites, mainly assigned to the Zoophycos and Cruziana ichnofacies. ]"

However, over the past 150 years the region has experienced giant earthquakes and their associated tsunamis from several key circum-Pacific sources. The 2011 Tōhoku, 1960 Valdivia, 1946 Aleutian and 1868 Arica tsunamis have been Pacific-wide events that, together with recent modelling, serve as a guide in helping to understand those that occurred in prehistory. Extant palaeotsunami data were used in conjunction with numerical modelling to examine current evidence for the spatial extent of notable prehistoric events dating back as far as 3800 years BP. An outcome of this work was the recognition that any search for palaeotsunami evidence should be intrinsically linked with numerical modelling as a guide to identifying additional potential sites for further research in order to better understand the nature and extent of individual events. Another outcome of this study was the identification of several key island archipelagos that are worthy of focussed research because they have the potential to rapidly accelerate our understanding of the magnitude and frequency of past events. These include the centrally located Hawaiian Islands and the Marquesas archipelago that are exposed to Pacific-wide tsunamis from most circum-Pacific sources. It was also noted that there has been a dearth of research in some sectors of the Pacific Ocean, such as the western Pacific archipelagos of the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Guam, and Northern Mariana Islands, while conversely in other sectors a significant quantum of research is showing great promise such as in New Zealand, the Samoan archipelago, Cook Islands, and Vanuatu. The ultimate finding of this work is that while much has been achieved, much more remains to be done to better understand the magnitude and frequency of past events and the true nature of tsunami hazard and risk in the region. ]"

CROCO, OSCAR and GlobCurrent have similar performances over the Tropical Atlantic Ocean. CROCO is best in the Gulf of Guinea. The simulations underestimate the drifters and FADs velocities. FADs may not be appropriate to use for corroborating Lagrangian simulations. , In the Tropical Atlantic Ocean, we assessed the accuracy of a Lagrangian model (Ichthyop) forced with velocity fields from a hydrodynamical model (CROCO) and two different remote sensing products (GlobCurrent and OSCAR) using trajectories of oceanographic drifters. Additionally, we evaluated the possibility to expand the drifters data using trajectories of GPS-buoy equipped drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). The observed and simulated trajectories were compared in terms of spatial distribution, velocity distribution and a nondimensional skill score. For the drifters and FADs, the GlobCurrent and OSCAR products lead to similar performances as the CROCO model-ouputs in the broad studied domain. In the Gulf of Guinea, however, the CROCO model performed significantly better than the other two because the parent solution of CROCO benefited from its communication with a child grid of finer resolution in this region. On average, the simulations lead to an underestimation of the drifter and FAD velocities, likely because the spatial resolutions of the forcing products were insufficient and the time frequency at which they were produced were too low to resolve the relevant oceanic processes properly. We found a low skill for all models to simulate FAD trajectories, possibly because of the devices vertical structure that prevent FADs from drifting like water parcels. Our results therefore suggest that in the Tropical Atlantic the FAD dataset may not be appropriate to use for corroborating Lagrangian simulations. ]"

Beach groundwater hydrodynamics are a result of combined forcing from the tide and waves at a range of frequencies, and a large number of observations exist which describe the shape and elevation of the beach watertable in response to tidal forcing at diurnal, semi-diurnal and spring-neap tidal frequencies. Models of beach watertable response to tidal forcing have been successfully validated; however, models of watertable response to wave forcing are less well developed and require verification. Improved predictions of swash zone sediment transport and beach profile evolution cannot be achieved unless the complex fluid and sediment interactions between the surface flow and the beach groundwater are better understood, particularly the sensitivity of sediment transport processes to flow perpendicular to the permeable bed. The presence of a capillary fringe, particularly when it lies just below the sand surface, has influences on beach groundwater dynamics. The presence of a capillary fringe can have a significant effect on the exchange of water between the ocean and the coastal aquifer, particularly in terms of the storage capacity of the aquifer. Field and laboratory observations have also shown that natural groundwater waves usually propagate faster and decay more slowly in aquifers with a capillary fringe, and observations which suggest that horizontal flows may also occur in the capillary zone have been reported. The effects of infiltration and exfiltration are generally invoked to explain why beaches with a low watertable tend to accrete and beaches with a high watertable tend to erode. However, the relative importance of processes such as infiltration losses in the swash, changes in the effective weight of the sediment, and modified shear stress due to boundary layer thinning, are not yet clear. Experimental work on the influence of seepage flows within sediment beds provides conflicting results concerning the effect on bed stability. Both modelling and experimental work indicates that the hydraulic conductivity of the beach is a critical parameter. However, hydraulic conductivity varies both spatially and temporally on beaches, particularly on gravel and mixed sand and gravel beaches. Another important, but poorly understood, consideration in beach groundwater studies is the role of air encapsulation during the wetting of beach sand. ]"

Typical SST images have been selected for each season (most of the SST images shown here are from 1987). Analyses of daily winds show these are related to the near-shore temperature patterns. The images of pigment concentrations are selected from the period 1980–1985. The SST images clearly show the upwelling variability along the coast of Northwest Africa. The analyses of daily wind fields are consistent with the spatial and temporal variability of upwelling as observed in the SST images. Several mesoscale patterns which have not been described in the existing literature are noticed in the images. These apply to the long warm water trails found in the wake of the Canary Islands and to the filaments of cool coastal water extending far offshore between 32°N and 31°N. Other unusual heating patterns are found on the shelf in the shadow zone of winds and currents south of Cape Ghir and in the bay inshore of the peninsula of Rio de Oro at approximately 24°N.

Due to the lack of protection awareness in developing and utilizing processes, many island ecosystems have suffered severe damage. The government has made measures to regulate the use of uninhabited islands and sea areas, but that is inadequate. We constructed a model of accounting for the natural resource stock and ecosystem services based on emergy analysis to incorporate the ecological cost into the current national uninhabited island use fee system. We used three uninhabited islands in Shanghai as case studies to elaborate on the valuing mechanism. The results illustrate that emergy analysis is applicable for measuring the ecological value of different ecosystems of uninhabited islands, and the price mechanism combined with the ecological capital cost fundamentally enhances the traditional use fee system within an acceptable increased price. The pricing model provides a powerful tool for sustainable use of uninhabited islands, helps policymaking, and can be extended to other uninhabited islands. ]"
894,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661102000277,[ The Northern Oscillation Index (NOI): a new climate index for the northeast Pacific ],"[ We introduce the Northern Oscillation Index (NOI), a new index of climate variability based on the difference in sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies at the North Pacific High (NPH) in the northeast Pacific (NEP) and near Darwin, Australia, in a climatologically low SLP region. These two locations are centers of action for the north Pacific Hadley–Walker atmospheric circulation. SLPs at these sites have a strong negative correlation that reflects their roles in this circulation. Global atmospheric circulation anomaly patterns indicate that the NEP is linked to the western tropical Pacific and southeast Asia via atmospheric wave trains associated with fluctuations in this circulation. Thus the NOI represents a wide range of tropical and extratropical climate events impacting the north Pacific on intraseasonal, interannual, and decadal scales. The NOI is roughly the north Pacific equivalent of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), but extends between the tropics and extratropics. Because the NOI is partially based in the NEP, it provides a more direct indication of the mechanisms by which global-scale climate events affect the north Pacific and North America. The NOI is dominated by interannual variations associated with El Niño and La Niña (EN/LN) events. Large positive (negative) index values are usually associated with LN (EN) and negative (positive) upper ocean temperature anomalies in the NEP, particularly along the North American west coast. The NOI and SOI are highly correlated, but are clearly different in several respects. EN/LN variations tend to be represented by larger swings in the NOI. Forty percent of the interannual moderate and strong interannual NOI events are seen by the SOI as events that are either weak or opposite in sign. The NOI appears to be a better index of environmental variability in the NEP than the SOI, and NPH SLP alone, suggesting the NOI is more effective at incorporating the influences of regional and remotely teleconnected climate processes. The NOI contains alternating decadal-scale periods dominated by positive and negative values, suggesting substantial climate shifts on a roughly 14-year ‘cycle’. The NOI was predominantly positive prior to 1965, during 1970–1976 and 1984–1991, and since 1998. Negative values predominated in 1965–1970, 1977–1983, and 1991–1998. In the NEP, interannual and decadal-scale negative NOI periods (e.g. EN events) are generally associated with weaker trade winds, weaker coastal upwelling-favorable winds, warmer upper ocean temperatures, lower Pacific Northwest salmon catch, higher Alaska salmon catch, and generally decreased macrozooplankton biomass off southern California. The opposite physical and biological patterns generally occur when the index is positive. Simultaneous correlations of the NOI with north Pacific upper ocean temperature anomalies are greatest during the boreal winter and spring. Lagged correlations of the winter and spring NOI with subsequent upper ocean temperatures are high for several seasons. The relationships between the NOI and atmospheric and physical and biological oceanic anomalies in the NEP indicate this index is a useful diagnostic of climate change in the NEP, and suggest mechanisms linking variations in the physical environment to marine resources on interannual to decadal climate scales.

Through different vantages they each ask the question, ‘what does the rock record actually record?’ These studies show the stratigraphic record to be highly incomplete across multiple time scales. They focus new attention on the inverse relationship that was long ago demonstrated by Sadler (1981) between calculated sedimentation rates and the time span of the sections over which the measurements are made. Similarly, these studies note only parts of past processes and events make the final stratigraphic cut. Deep questions about the stratigraphic record remain. Which processes and events preserve? How are these processes and events recorded? What processes govern preferences for preservation of one deposit over another? What is the overall completeness of the stratigraphic recorded? In short, exactly how representative is the stratigraphic record of the geologic past? Despite all these caveats, stratigraphy still appears to preserve a robust record of past time and process. This paper explores current thinking on the sampling processes that build sedimentary deposits, controls on how much and what part of these deposits are preserved, and the interplay between autogenic and allogenic processes over the range of geological time scales. The paper offers a series of guidelines for field geologists attempting to interpret siliciclastic deposits in light of the evolving complex view and limited completeness for the stratigraphic record. ]"

The number of global, national and port level policies is limited. Current policies are focused on relative improvements, not overall emissions caps. Current policies are unlikely to sufficiently achieve pollutant reduction goals. , Shipping is associated with various environmental impacts, such as pollutants discharged to air and sea. Much of this pollution appears to be unregulated, and global emissions from shipping are expected to more than triple between 2020 and 2050. This paper reviews global, national, regional and port-level legislative approaches that have been implemented to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrous oxides (NO x ), sulphur oxides (SO x ) and particulate matter (PM). Policies are identified on the basis of a systematic review of the literature in combination with a detailed analysis of the respective global, national and local policy initiatives. Findings suggest that many policies are voluntary or, in ports, incentive-based; regulatory approaches are largely limited to Emission Control Areas. Policies also focus on efficiencies, they are not concerned with absolute pollutant and greenhouse gas levels. No policies incentivizing or forcing the transition to zero-carbon fuels were identified. As ports can define limits to pollution, for instance by demanding shore power use, they can significantly affect the clean development of the sector. Further legislation will be needed nationally to counterbalance the lack of supranational ambition on pollutants and climate change mitigation . ]"

Regularly updated climate indices are identified that have previously been linked to Australian climate and weather events. Observation of Australian weather is severely hampered by the continents' vastness and remoteness, as evidenced by heavy bias of in situ measurements that are generally clustered in the coastal high-population centres (mainly southeast of Australia), with central and northern regions often having to rely on remote sensing and reanalysis data. Data sparsity can introduce significant uncertainty in terms of extreme weather and climate change management, as variables such as rainfall exhibit high spatial and temporal variability. Several areas for future research are identified, including investigation into the impact of Australian aerosol levels, the connection between soil moisture and flooding potential, and teleconnection between Atlantic sea surface temperature and Australian climate.

Recurring questions with the associated studies have concerned when and how the ancestors of the various clades reached the island. For the land-bound animals, the common view is that they arrived after the Cretaceous on ‘rafts' that washed in from Africa. However, this centuries-old discussion has been periodically spiked with proposals for land-bridges, with a recent one arguing for three separate causeways or stepping-stone chains connecting Africa and Madagascar in the early, middle, and late Cenozoic (66–60 Ma, 36–30 Ma, and 12–5 Ma). Here, the general idea of former causeways spanning the Mozambique Channel is evaluated based on an extensive survey of the related geological and geophysical literature, a large portion of which dates from the last half-decade. The analysis, which makes use of a newly-developed topological schema, indicates that only a small number of the supposed dry-land sub-paths were actually subaerial during each of the postulated colonization windows. Notably, during the Early Oligocene , a 220–250 km 2 pinnacle in the Sakalaves Seamount group formed a volcanic ‘high-island’. The other offshore sectors that were exposed would have been atoll crowns: Juan de Nova Island throughout the Cenozoic and the northern Sakalaves in the Late Miocene . However, it would have been challenging for most land animals to exist on those low-elevation carbonate platforms for any length of time. Therefore, the notion of Africa and Madagascar being linked in the Cenozoic by terrestrial walkways can be regarded as falsified. Over-water dispersal best explains how 26 of Madagascar's 27 land-vertebrate clades colonized the landmass. The exception, a group of small, soil-dwelling snakes, is likely a relict lineage whose ancestors were present on the island prior to Madagascar's geographical isolation that resulted from the tectonic block's breakup with India-Seychelles c . 85 Ma. ]"

Peatlands form over thousands of years, where waterlogged conditions result in accumulation of organic matter. Vast areas of Southeast Asian peatlands have been impacted by land use change and fires, whilst lowland tropical peatlands of Central Africa and South America remain largely hydrologically intact. To predict accurately how these peatlands may respond to potential future disturbances, an understanding of their long-term history is necessary. This paper reviews the palaeoecological literature on tropical peatlands of Southeast Asia, Central Africa and South America. It addresses the following questions: (i) what were the past ecological dynamics of peatlands before human activity?; (ii) how did they respond to anthropogenic and natural disturbances through the palaeoanthropocene, the period from whence evidence for human presence first appeared?; and, (iii) given their past ecological resilience and current exposure to accelerating human impacts , how might the peatlands respond to drivers of change prevalent in the anthropocene ? Through y synthesising palaeoecological records, this review demonstrates how tropical peatland ecosystems have responded dynamically, persisting through fire (both natural and anthropogenic), climatic and human-induced disturbances in the palaeoanthropocene. Ecosystem resilience does, however, appear to be compromised in the past c . 200 years in Southeast Asian peatlands, faced with transformative anthropogenic impacts.

Salinization of groundwater is most pronounced on the western/coastal side of the aquifer, with an aerial extent of 26.7 km 2 , where maximum values are reported for conductivity (31 mS/cm) and Cl − concentrations (16,271 mg/L). Salinization is likely to increase if groundwater pumping continues at levels comparable to the present time. Upward incursion of marine water into the aquifer is inferred from δ 2 H (−7.2 ‰) and δ 18 O (+1.6‰) compositions of groundwater samples with the highest conductivity. Compared to modern seawater in the Gulf of California, ratios of SO 4 /Cl and Cl/Br are small (0.01 and 33, respectively) and the S isotopic composition of SO 4 2 - SO 4 2 - is high (+32.7%) in the most saline portions of the Costa de Hermosillo. This saline groundwater is inferred to result from an earlier phase of dissimilatory bacterial SO 4 2 - SO 4 2 - reduction coupled to decomposition of organic matter in marine blue clays deposited during the Miocene/Pliocene transgression. The isotopic composition of present-day surface discharge from agricultural fields is substantially enriched in 32 S due to widespread application of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 fertilizers and potential mobilization of S from mineral resources.

However, the extent and effects of increased SO 4 2- concentrations in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems remain poorly understood regarding many aspects of ecosystem structure and functioning. Here, we review the sources of SO 4 2- pollution, environmental impacts on freshwater ecosystems and bioremediation opportunites and we identify key knowledge gaps and future research needs. Natural sources of dissolved SO 4 2- in freshwater ecosystems include mineral weathering, volcanic activity, decomposition and combustion of organic matter, oxidation of sulphides , and sea spray aerosols. Acid mine drainage , fertiliser leaching from agricultural soils , wetland drainage, agricultural and industrial wastewater runoff as well as sea level changes are the main direct and indirect sources of the anthropogenic SO 4 2- input to waterbodies. Increasing SO 4 2- concentrations in freshwater systems influence the biogeochemical processes of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Similarly, iron availability can be critical in determining the adverse effects of SO 4 2- on environmental receptors. The literature reviewed clearly demonstrates that SO 4 2- pollution may have toxic effects on aquatic plants and animal organisms, including, among others, fishes, invertebrates and amphibians, and it may also have negative implications for human health. Bioremediation systems provide opportunities to mitigate the impacts of SO 4 2- , but removal efficiencies range widely from 0% to 70% across treatment systems such as constructed wetlands , permeable reactive barriers and bioreactors . We conclude that examination of increased SO 4 2- concentrations and fluxes at different spatial scales is urgently needed as the ongoing global perturbation of the S cycle is likely to be accelerated by climate change and human development activities. The adverse effects of this on freshwater organisms worldwide may prove detrimental to the future well-being of humans and ecosystems. Field-scale research to estimate the ecotoxicological effects of elevated SO 4 2- concentrations is recommended as is widespread implementation of large-scale wetland restoration and bioremediation systems to reduce SO 4 2- loads on freshwater ecosystems. ]"

A global response is necessary to curb the issue to protect marine environments. Current Interntional, European and Regional Scottish law and policies that address marine litter are inadequate. Integration of policies with marine regional plans is required to tackle this ubiquitous problem. Raising awareness is the key to success. , Within recent years, the issue of marine litter has become increasingly relevant to the citizens of Scotland. Inputs from shipping and fishing activities with additional contributions from society's throw away lifestyle has inundated healthy seas, endangered wildlife and degraded the health of the oceans. International, European and Scot's law governing the marine environment exists on a legally and non-legally binding basis, with the strictest of regulations concerning marine litter more commonly found on a non-legally binding basis. A global response is necessary to curb the issue but despite commitments to protect the marine environment, many States that have committed to reducing environmental pollution via international treaties are lagging on their promises. The introduction of marine planning to reduce conflict between users and the marine environment has the potential to address marine litter and to uphold commitments for healthy seas under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. This paper, using a scientific literature-based analysis, evaluates international, European and Scottish environmental law that addresses aspects of marine litter, including inputs, types of marine litter and the outcomes of parties found guilty of contributing to the issue. Integration of these policies within regional marine plans utilising local knowledge has become the first step in tackling this ubiquitous problem, as well as increasing awareness of policies and marine planning amongst the public. A survey was carried out in Scotland to establish awareness levels on these topics: awareness of marine litter (100%), marine planning (34%) and regional marine plans (33%). Raising public awareness of marine planning will aid its effectiveness in reducing the presence and impact of marine litter. ]"

This review article aims to describe these morphological trends from five modern tide-dominated river deltas using original data collected from satellite images and bathymetric maps and published data from field surveys. All the studied channels show similar trends with two distinct tracts separated by areas of morphological changes. The upstream tracts are characterized by constant width, relatively high sinuosity, and seaward-increasing depth, and are mainly controlled by the fluvial dynamics. The downstream tracts are characterized by seaward-increasing width, relatively low sinuosity, and seaward-decreasing depth, and are mainly controlled by the tidal dynamics. The delineation of this morphological configuration of the channels is crucial to understand the responses of deltas to the interacting riverine and marine processes. Additionally, this has important implications for depositional and hydraulic models, and for the long-term evolution and the assessment of human-induced versus natural modifications of these systems. ]"

In this chapter, we present a comprehensive review of our field studies on the exhumed Zuccale low-angle normal fault (central Italy) aimed at characterizing the fault zone structure, and we use geological evidence to make inferences about the possible seismic behavior of the detachment. The key component of the fault zone is a pervasively foliated fault core, crosscut by numerous carbonate mineral veins interpreted to be hydrofractures, which is sandwiched between hanging wall and footwall blocks where the deformation is entirely brittle. To explain this, we suggest that an initial phase of frictional brecciation and cataclasis increased fault zone permeability and facilitated the pervasive grain-scale influx of CO 2 -rich hydrous fluids into the fault zone. The fluids reacted with the fine-grained cataclasites and triggered low-grade alteration and the onset of stress-induced dissolution and precipitation processes (i.e., pressure solution). The resulting switch from frictional to pressure-solution accommodated deformation led to shear localization and the formation of a foliated fault core rich in phyllosilicates . We predict a fault slip-behavior in which aseismic creep occurs by pressure-solution-accommodated “frictional-viscous” slip along the phyllosilicate-rich foliate at low-friction coefficients (0.2 to 0.3), with transient small ruptures induced by local buildups of fluid overpressure trapped below the low-permeability fault core. ]"

We synthesize the results of a multidisciplinary programme on environmental impacts of STDs in Norwegian fjords, providing new knowledge that can be applied to assess and mitigate impact of tailing disposal globally, both for submarine and deep-sea activities. Detailed geological seafloor mapping provided data on natural sedimentation to monitor depositional processes on the seafloor.

Toxicity tests showed biological impacts on test species due to particulate and chemical exposure. Hypersedimentation mesocosm and field experiments showed a varying response on the benthos , allowing to determine the transition zone in the STD impact area. Recolonisation studies indicate that full community recovery and normalisation of metal leakage rates may take several decades due to bioturbation and slow burial of sulfidic tailings.

One of these volcanic associations is represented by the El Maitén Belt, located to the east of the main Andes for over ~300 km. This volcanic belt reflects the evolution of a continental arc in an extensional setting with remarkable compositional variations between the late Eocene and the early Miocene . We present new field and isotopic data that, together with lithological, geochronological and geochemical data compilations, suggest significant changes in the nature and location of magmatic sources. This evolution may be summarized in three stages: i) incipient arc magmatism , with a tholeiitic basaltic-basaltic andesitic composition, which evolved to ii) a mature arc, characterized by calc-alkaline andesitic-dacitic associations, and a final stage characterized by iii) a late Oligocene-early Miocene juvenile, tholeiitic basaltic volcanism , interpreted as the result of a westward arc migration and extension in the back-arc. Therefore, considering the mid-Cenozoic tectonic configuration given by the eastward subduction of the Farallon and Nazca plates , we evaluate slab dynamics within a petrological framework that can reproduce the geochemical-geochronological characteristics of this belt. In this sense, rollback of the Nazca plate is the most suitable scenario to explain the El Maitén Belt behavior during this protracted extensional regime of Andean evolution. ]"

Open boundaries for this model were generated with a basin scale model covering major parts of the North Atlantic and nested in two steps into models with grid resolutions of 10 and 3.3km, respectively. The ecosystem model consists of eight state variables (nitrate, ammonium, silicate, diatoms, flagellates, meso- and microzooplankton, fast and slow sinking detritus) and assumes that nitrogen and silicate are the potential limiting nutrients. The primitive equation models produced coastal upwelling that injects nutrients into the euphotic zone in response to northerly wind forcing. Filaments were formed when the upwelling favourable wind peaked in July/August. High primary production was found on the shelf and in the core of the upwelling filaments. The simulations used atmospheric input from 1998 allowing comparison with a Lagrangian experiment in August 1998. The ecological model, having the same structure as a model been applied on boreal shelves, gave good simulations of the carbon flux on and off the Iberian margin. However, some stocks and rates of carbon were not well validated with the data from the field investigation.

Here, we investigate the relationships between tectonics, climate and exhumation by inverting low-temperature thermochronological data compiled from the literature (824 ages from 549 samples) and new data (238 ages from 146 samples) to quantify the exhumation rate history of the Central Andes since 80 Ma. Our inferred exhumation rates west of the drainage divide and between 18 and 32°S did not exceed 0.25 km/Ma. Such low exhumation rates are consistent with low shortening rates and arid conditions in this region. Local pulses of exhumation occurred only during the Eocene as response to active deformation and during the Miocene , probably as response to uplift of the western Andean slope. East of the drainage divide between 18 and 28°S, the observed exhumation pattern reflects the onset and eastward propagation of deformation. Here, exhumation occurred locally since the middle-to-late Eocene in the Eastern Cordillera and the Altiplano-Puna and subsequently affected larger parts of these regions and the north-western Sierra Pampeanas during the Oligocene . In the early Miocene (~20 Ma), the Interandean zone started exhuming and at 12-10 Ma exhumation propagated into the Subandean zone. Enhanced shortening rates and intensified precipitation along the eastern deformation front associated with the onset of the South American Monsoon led to increased exhumation rates in the eastern Interandean and the Subandean zones in the Plio-Pleistocene (0.6 km/Ma). Higher Pleistocene exhumation rates are also observed in the northern Sierra Pampeanas (1.5 km/Ma) that can be related to rock uplift along steep reverse faults coupled with high precipitation. South of 32°S on the western side, exhumation rates in the Principal Cordillera increased from ca. 0.25 km/Ma in the Miocene to rates locally exceeding 2 km/Ma in the Pleistocene. Whereas the tectonic regime in the southern Principal Cordillera remained unchanged since the late Miocene, these higher rates are likely associated with enhanced erosion resulting from intensified Pleistocene precipitation and glacial growth in this region, reinforced by isostatic rock uplift and active tectonics. Our study shows that the onset of exhumation correlates mainly with the initiation of horizontal shortening and crustal thickening , whereas the magnitude of exhumation is largely set by the amount of precipitation and glacial erosion and by the style of deformation, which is controlled by inherited structures and the amount of sediments in the foreland. ]"

The complexity and interdependencies across critical infrastructure domains makes it susceptible to cascading failures, with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the most recent example of disruptions in supply chains, healthcare and emergency facilities. Stress testing offers a conceptual framework and methodology for identifying risks associated with cascading failures and selecting mitigation and recovery strategies. This paper reviews the fundamentals of stress-testing science and practice in different fields (medicine, engineering, economics) and identifies challenges associated with the application of existing methodologies to infrastructure systems. The currently practiced risk-based stress testing approaches may only be of limited use because they merely aim to identify the components of failing systems by varying stress loads. Adding a systems-thinking perspective and consideration of interconnectedness across system domains facilitates resilience stress testing (i.e., the impact of disruptions on the system's ability to recover and adapt). We propose combining risk and resilience stress testing into a tiered approach applicable to complex, interconnected infrastructure. ]"

The elevation of a flat depends on the long-term water-level and currents. As a result of the rising water-level, the flats are migrating over an inclined Pleistocene basement. This migration depends on the balance of sedimentation versus erosion which is a function of water depth. Regular measurements of the water-level have been made since the middle of the 19th century. From the observations of the MHW it is estimated that the water-level has risen to approximately 30cm in the past hundred years. Recent investigations show that the change of the half-tide water-level is less than that of MHW. The increasing tidal range also changes the sedimentation processes over the tidal flats. The quantitative influence of the altered tidal range on the sedimentation and the morphology of the Wadden Sea is as important as that of the influence of mean water-level elevation. Changes in the elevation of the coastal plain caused by tectonic forces or subsidence cannot be determined. Extensive investigations were conducted to determine quantitatively the sedimentation processes which have taken place since 1936. The sediment budget of the Flackstrom basin (low macrotidal coast) is presented. With respect to the MHW datum plane, sedimentation of 20 × 10 6 m 3 has taken place in this area. This is equivalent to a mean silting-up of 30cm over the past 46 years, an average 0.7cm/year. The sedimentation process is dependent upon the mean elevation of the flat. Most of the sedimentation has taken place above the half-tide water-level. Therefore, the flanks of the flats have risen more than the tops and the sand-ridges, which certainly reflects the very small long-term water-level elevation change of only 3cm which occurred during the period investigated (1936 to 1982). Recent investigations of the present state show a relationship between the tidal range and the height of the main sedimentation-zone. Comparisons of the Flackstrom (tidal range approximately 3.40m) and parts of the Dutch Wadden Sea (tidal range approximately 1.80m) indicate that the main sedimentation-zone moves down-shore from half-tide water-level to mean-low-water with the decrease of the tidal range, due to differences in the general course of the hypsometric curves over the tidal flat areas. ]"

However, this opinion is not upheld by all geoscientists. Here Miocene fossil plant assemblages from 75 broadly scattered sites across China were investigated with the Co-existence Approach (CA) to exhibit trends in temperature and precipitation in time and space. Modern distributions and recorded climate data from China regarding the nearest living relatives of the fossil plant taxa were employed to pin-point the climatic parameters in which a maximum number of taxa could coexist. Evolution and climatic trends are presented in maps of China from the early, middle to late Miocene. These maps illustrate that the ranges of the temperature and precipitation in the Miocene were similar to or just a little larger than those in the Eocene but much smaller than those of the present. The whole of China still had low latitudinal climate gradients and was characterized by a subtropical climate without any arid region.

Effects of moderately elevated p CO 2 on marine bivalves are potentially alleviated following transgenerational exposure. 2. Transgenerational effects on geochemical properties of marine bivalve shells can have widespread implications for sclerochronology. , Ocean acidification can negatively impact marine bivalves, especially their shell mineralization processes. Consequently, whether marine bivalves can rapidly acclimate and eventually adapt in an acidifying ocean is now increasingly receiving considerable attention. Projecting the fate of this vulnerable taxonomic group is also pivotal for the science of sclerochronology – the study which seeks to deduce records of past environmental changes and organismal life-history traits from various geochemical properties of periodically layered hard tissues (bivalve shells, corals, fish otoliths , etc.). In this review, we provide a concise overview of the long-term and transgenerational responses of marine bivalves to elevated p CO 2 manifested at different levels of biological organization, with a specific focus on responses of geochemical properties (stable carbon and oxygen isotopes , minor and trace elements and microstructures) of their shells. Without exception, positive transgenerational responses to an elevated p CO 2 scenario projected for the year 2100 have been found in all five bivalve species hitherto studied, under the umbrella of two non-genetic mechanisms (increased maternal provisioning and epigenetic inheritance), suggesting that marine bivalves have remarkable transgenerational phenotypic plasticity which allows them to respond plastically and acclimate rapidly in an acidifying ocean. Rapid transgenerational acclimation , especially in terms of physiological processes, however, hinders a reliable interpretation of proxy records. Transgenerationally acclimated bivalves can actively modify the calcification physiology in response to elevated p CO 2 , which in turn affects the processes of almost all geochemical proxies preserved in their shells. In particular, stable carbon isotopes , metabolically regulated elements (Na, K, Cu, Zn, Fe, etc.), and shell microstructures can be highly biased. In this context, we propose a number of challenges and opportunities the field of sclerochronology may face. ]"

A recent hypothesis proposes that secondary contact among refugial cisco lineages during retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet was the basis for the geography of cisco diversity in North American lakes. Glacial lake coverage in North America is also a map of Mysis diluviana distribution, a glacial relic species found in lakes including the Laurentian Great Lakes. The presence of Mysis increases isotopic niche size of cisco, a necessary condition for Mysis to be a key element of cisco clade diversification. We reviewed literature on cisco forms in North American lakes to determine if cisco diversity is related to an ecological opportunity gradient, maximum lake depth with the presence of Mysis . Cisco form diversity increases with lake maximum depth in North America in the presence of Mysis with deeper lakes increasingly likely to hold multiple forms. Lakes without Mysis had only one cisco form and were shallower in general. We hypothesize that Mysis is the basis for the relationship between lake depth and cisco form diversity because of the complex behavior and distribution of Mysis that stems from increasing lake depth. We propose the geography of cisco diversity in North America results from within lake predator–prey processes as a function of lake depth under the Mysis hypothesis vs. secondary contact priming genetic diversity. The two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Analysis of a lake set covering both cisco and Mysis ranges points to more lakes having multiple cisco forms. ]"

It is defined by a distinct and ancient surface, known as the Pacific Paleosurface (PPS) or Atacama Paleosurface . The age of this surface is determined as the time at which sediment deposition ceased, and the surface was effectively abandoned. Early studies suggested that this abandonment took place between 14 and 10 Ma, and was related to both the uplift of the Andes and the onset of hyperaridity in the region.

Current developments in ecosystem-based approaches to climate adaptation (EbA) and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) tend to focus on scientific projections, engineering techniques, and their respective roles in shaping economic benefits. However, recent studies show that effective implementation of such solutions is dependent on the governance practices and interactions between relevant actors, interests, and institutional structures. In response, this paper reviews the current status of governance studies in the context of EbA and Eco-DRR. The analysis is grounded in the interdisciplinary theories of governance, socio-ecological systems, infrastructure studies, and multilevel politics, with sources derived from scientific databases including Scopus and Science Direct advanced query. Based on the review, we evaluate existing governance theories, assessment methods, and implementation through illustrating emblematic examples from around the world. The paper concludes with a synthesis of governance gaps and opportunities, and notes that while emerging ecological engineering approaches provide distinct opportunities, there is a lack of comprehensive assessment beyond diagnosing potential financial, institutional, and political shortfalls. We therefore highlight the need for future research on the socio-ecological, spatial/scalar, and political dimensions of EbA and Eco-DRR. ]"

This paper critically reviews existing frameworks and methods to understand their application in a disaster context, to highlight key challenges and future directions for developing robust social resilience assessment frameworks. The analysis revealed a lack of consistency in key concepts used to measure social resilience to disasters. This results in significant confusion in the way key concepts are understood, interpreted, and applied. Due to the multi-faceted nature of social resilience concepts, there are pronounced theoretical and practical difficulties in carrying out a rapid, but rational, accurate, and meaningful assessment of social resilience to disasters. Many of the key process-oriented indicators are not included in the existent social resilience frameworks, since they are not easy to operationalise due to their dynamic nature. Therefore, a comprehensive social resilience framework that can be adapted to different contexts and integrated with specific measurement tools and guidelines is necessary. Such a comprehensive framework can make resilience measurement consistent across geographies by adapting it with context specific resilience characteristics. ]"

Part of this growth stems from a widening in understanding of the real problems that would result from a continued rise in global sea-level, whilst part comes from the subject's present popularity in the earth sciences. The potential for the application of sea-level data is wide. The publications in 1977 of VAIL, MITCHUM, TODD, WIDMEIR, THOMPSON, SANGREE, BUBB and HATLEHID's approach to ‘seismic stratigraphy’ stimulated an expansion in commercial and geological applications of sea-level data. Further, the value of shoreline data in testing models of earth crustal behaviour and mantle rheology is well established. In biogeography, data may be used to test the feasibility of land bridge development and the consequential movements of plants and animals. In the coastal zone, the probable continuing and even accelerating rise of sea-level, resulting from man-induced changes of the environment, has thrown a scare into all those concerned with shoreline management. Ingeneous solutions have been developed to cope with the sea-level problem, ranging from physical barrages to proposals for large-scale water mass transfers. But how technically able, or more importantly, prepared, is mankind to manage a long-term progressively rising sea-level? The aims of Project 61 were found to be unattainable, will the results of Project 200 be of greater practical relevance? ]"

These are recent sediment bodies that have accumulated under a combination of conditions including: (1) abundant supplies of sediment; (2) morphological barriers that act as sediment traps; and (3) hydrographic conditions that favour the accumulation of fine sediment in these sinks. This paper describes the mechanisms controlling the deposition of the fine-grained sediment depositions and the processes that result in resuspension processes on the Galicia-Minho Shelf. Fine-grained sediments are provided from discharges from the river basins on the southern sector of the shelf, mainly the Douro and Minho rivers. Sediments are exported from river estuaries onto the shelf during episodic flood events. In contrast, most of the sediments originating from the Galician hinterland fail to contribute significantly to sedimentation on the shelf, because they are retained in the Galician Rías, which function as sediment traps. Sediments deposited on the shelf are frequently remobilized, particularly during southwesterly storms that coincide with downwelling conditions. Once in suspension the fine-grained sediments are transported northwards by the poleward flowing bottom currents and are eventually deposited on the Douro and Galicia Mud patches after a series of resuspension events. The locations of the two mud patches are strongly influenced by the shelf morphology. Fines already deposited on the mud patches are occasionally reintroduced into the system by large storm events. Some material from the Douro Mud patch and adjacent areas is re-deposited in the Galicia Mud patch. It is probable that sediments re-suspended from the Galicia Mud patch are carried off the shelf when storm events coincide with downwelling conditions. ]"

The at-sea ecology of these lampreys concerns the juvenile stage, in which growth is most rapid. Anadromous lampreys can be categorized into four groups, based on feeding modalities: 1) scavenger (Caspian lamprey, Caspiomyzon wagneri ); 2) parasite-predator (Pacific lamprey, Entosphenus tridentatus ); 3) predators (western river lamprey, Lampetra ayresii ; European river lamprey, L. fluviatilis ; Arctic lamprey, Lethenteron camtschaticum ; pouched lamprey, Geotria australis ; and Argentinian pouched lamprey, G. macrostoma ); and 4) parasites (sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus ; Chilean lamprey, Mordacia lapicida ; and short-headed lamprey, M. mordax ). This paper discusses direct evidence for lamprey feeding ecology, as observed through lamprey-induced wounds on hosts and prey, and lamprey attachments on hosts and prey; and indirect evidence for feeding ecology, via analyses of fatty acids, stable isotopes , contaminants, and bioenergetics modelling. A part of the information presented on feeding ecology is from landlocked sea lamprey, and in some instances this information can be generalizable to anadromous populations. For most anadromous lampreys, but particularly for Southern Hemisphere taxa, little is known about their feeding ecology at sea. Duration of the trophic marine phase and habitat use are still subjects of debate. Species identified as lamprey hosts can be demersal or pelagic, possibly reflecting marine habitat preferences. To unlock understanding of the marine phase of anadromous lampreys, direct evidence of feeding ecology should be coupled with natural (i.e., biomarkers) and artificial (e.g., biologgers) markers to identify habitat use, movement patterns and dispersal. ]"

All mechanisms are not mutually exclusive for a single invasive species, but can act synergistically during an invasion. These mechanisms have substantial ecological and evolutionary implications that affect communities and ecosystems. This suggests that parasite-mediated impacts should be integrated in assessing the consequences of biological invasions. , Worldwide, marine and coastal ecosystems are heavily invaded by introduced species and the potential role of parasites in the success and impact of marine invasions has been increasingly recognized. In this review, we link recent theoretical developments in invasion ecology with empirical studies from marine ecosystems in order to provide a conceptual framework for studying the role of parasites and their hosts in marine invasions. Based on an extensive literature search, we identified six mechanisms in which invaders directly or indirectly affect parasite and host populations and communities: I) invaders can lose some or all of their parasites during the invasion process (parasite release or reduction), often causing a competitive advantage over native species; II) invaders can also act as a host for native parasites, which may indirectly amplify the parasite load of native hosts (parasite spillback); III) invaders can also be parasites themselves and be introduced without needing co-introduction of the host (introduction of free-living infective stages); IV) alternatively, parasites may be introduced together with their hosts (parasite co-introduction with host); V) consequently, these co-introduced parasites can sometimes also infect native hosts (parasite spillover); and VI) invasive species may be neither a host nor a parasite, but nevertheless affect native parasite host interactions by interfering with parasite transmission (transmission interference). We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of each of these mechanisms and generally note several substantial effects on natural communities and ecosystems via i) mass mortalities of native populations creating strong selection gradients, ii) indirect changes in species interactions within communities and iii) trophic cascading and knock-on effects in food webs that may affect ecosystem function and services. Our review demonstrates a wide range of ecological and evolutionary implications of marine invasions for parasite–host interactions and suggests that parasite-mediated impacts should be integrated in assessing the risks and consequences of biological invasions. ]"

Recently, more and more giant W deposits have been discovered in both the Nanling region to the south and the Yangtze River region to the north, such as the Zhuxi, Dahutang, Pangushan, and Taoxikeng deposits. In this paper, based on previous publications and new exploration results of the W deposits in South China, the majority of such deposits are reviewed, and are divided into 8 types: quartz-vein, skarn, greisen, porphyry, granite veinlet-disseminated, fractural-hydrothermal, stratabound, and weathering-placer types. Those deposits are closely related to the widely-distributed granitoids. These ore-bearing granitoids typically belong to S-type or highly-fractionated I-type metaluminous-peraluminous calc-alkaline granitic magma series. The magma fractionation degrees are generally increased from those associated with skarn-type W deposits to those with veinlet-disseminated deposits. Crust materials played a key role in the formation of these W-mineralized granites, and also contributed to the various associated metals, such as W-Cu, W-Sn, W-Bi, W-Mo, and W-Be. According to the temporal-spatial association of W deposits with tectono-thermal events in South China, three metallogenic belts can be outlined for future exploration: Nanling W metallogenic Belt (NLB) (170–150 Ma), Eastern Yangtze W metallogenic Belt (EYB) (150–120 Ma), and Southeast Coast W metallogenic Belt (SCB) (120–80 Ma). According to the deep crustal structure features of these W metallogenic belts combined with characteristics of different W mineralization types, a generic model is proposed for the formation of the Mesozoic W deposits in South China. During the Mesozoic, from the southeast coast to the inland, the South China block experienced the west-toward subduction, retreating and conversion of the paleo-Pacific plate. Furthermore, deep faults in different areas enhance the local crust-mantle interaction, and W deposits types and temporal-spatial distribution of Mesozoic W deposits in different belts have good correspondence to the deep processes. ]"

In contrast, less attention has been paid the adjacent Ryukyu Trench because historical and geological records are scarce. In order to develop better quantitative estimates of the timing and size of the earthquakes and tsunamis generated along these subduction zones, comprehensive studies using geological, seismological and historical methods have been conducted. Since the 1990s, studies of tsunami deposits in this region have contributed to our current understanding of the history of tsunamis over the last 6000 years. Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, paleotsunami research has especially focused on guiding and enhancing tsunami disaster management and mitigation measures . The last nine years have seen a rapid increase in paleotsunami data from the Nankai Trough and Ryukyu Trench coasts. These recent studies reveal that there are significant differences in the size and recurrence pattern of earthquakes and tsunamis along these subduction zones. For instance, large earthquakes have repeatedly occurred along the Nankai Trough every 100–200 years. On the other hand, large earthquakes and tsunamis may not have occurred over the last few thousand years at the junction between these subduction zones. There is also no evidence for the occurrence of large earthquakes along the northern and central Ryukyu Trench over this time period. Large earthquakes and tsunamis may have occurred every few hundred years at the southern end of the Ryukyu Trench. Nevertheless, data on the occurrence of these earthquakes are still insufficient, both in quantity and quality, to estimate the maximum size or recurrence pattern. ]"

They also constitute world-renowned fossil-bearing strata from which &gt;500 hominin fossils were discovered over the past decades, with &gt;100 inventoried archeological sites. However, associated sedimentary dynamics and architectures as well as paleoenvironments are only partially reconstructed and the relative contribution of climate and tectonism to paleoenvironmental change over time remains unclear. Here, through the interpretation of sedimentary facies , the delineation of sequences and the analysis of δ 13 C in soil carbonates, we provide the first exhaustive reconstruction from ~ 4.00 to ~ 0.75 Ma of (i) fluctuations of the paleolake that occupied the Turkana Depression, (ii) the successive sedimentary dynamics and related paleolandscapes that characterized the West Turkana area and (iii) respective roles of climate and tectonism in the sedimentation. We show evidence for seven major transgression-regression (T-R) cycles between ~ 4.00 and ~ 0.75 Ma superimposed locally by lower amplitude T-R cycles. Comparing the sedimentological interpretations and the δ 13 C values in soil carbonates (literature data), we reveal that fluctuations of rainfall over the Ethiopian Dome, which hosts the drainage basin of the Omo River — the main tributary of Lake Turkana — controlled high-amplitude lake level fluctuations during the Plio-Pleistocene period. We also demonstrate that vegetation and tree cover evolved differently in the Omo Valley and West Turkana. Furthermore we outline that two different sedimentary systems reflecting two distinct modes of sedimentation alternated through times in the West Turkana area as a response to the variations in sediment supply coming from the western rift shoulder (i.e. Lapurr Range) that alternatively generated wave- or river-dominated sedimentary systems. In conclusion, we reveal that climate regulated water input, paleolake water-level fluctuations and vegetation. Tectonism determined sediment supply to the basin controlled in West Turkana by pulses of increased activity of the main border fault (i.e., the Murua Rith Lapurr Fault). ]"

Solution pipes vary in size, but are generally less than 1 m in diameter with variable depths, the deepest reaching 100 m. Most occur in eogenetic rocks, particularly in Quaternary calcareous sandstones (calcarenites), but some pipes are also reported in Miocene-Pliocene and Cretaceous chalk and calcarenites. Most of the published research favours their dissolutional origin, but offers different theories regarding the initial trigger that focused the water flow in the host rock matrix, including vegetation patterns and rock heterogeneities. Here we review the current state of knowledge regarding geomorphology of solution pipes and discuss in greater detail the potential role of dynamic instabilities and self-organisation in the emergence of focusing patterns. We review theoretical and numerical studies which allow estimation of interpipe distances, distribution of pipe lengths, extent of pipe merging and the influence of rock porosity on their shapes. In theory, linking the numerical predictions with field measurements might allow the use of pipe characteristics as potential paleoclimatic indicators, provided the problems of dating can be overcome. ]"

Also, uneven occupation of the territory leads to a significant stress in coastal areas and requires the diversion of significant volumes of water. In most Mediterranean countries, the main problem may not be scarcity of water in terms of average per capita, but the high cost of making water available at the right place, at the right time with the required quality. In these countries, more than anywhere else, an integrated approach for water resources management including wastewater reclamation and reuse locally is required. As a result, and following a general increase in wastewater treatment, wastewater reclamation and reuse is expected to increase sharply in the Mediterranean basin over the next decade and become an important aspect of integrated water resources management. Important projects are being developed and wastewater reclamation and reuse facilities have been built. These projects have followed local or national guidelines where available such as for example in Israel, France, Tunisia or Cyprus. Regulations on wastewater reclamation and reuse are essential. They help protect public health, increase water availability, prevent coastal pollution and enhance water resources and nature conservation policies. Unifying wastewater reclamation and reuse regulations around the Mediterranean basin would also contribute to secure economic and touristic exchanges in the region. However, there is still a controversy between the defenders of strict water quality standards for an absolute protection of public health and the defenders of a pragmatic stance recognizing existing wastewater reuse practices and promoting non-potable water uses with less restrictive water quality standards. Despite the high potential for wastewater reclamation and reuse in the Mediterranean countries, only a few have systematically exploited this resource. This paper presents the status of wastewater reclamation and reuse around the Mediterranean basin and discusses existing guidelines and regulations. The possibility of developing uniform wastewater reuse standards is also presented. ]"

Occasionally their grazing rates exceed seagrass growth rates, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as overgrazing. Because of a reported increasing frequency of overgrazing events, concomitant with loss of seagrass-associated ecosystem services, it has been suggested that overgrazing is one of the key threats to tropical and subtropical seagrasses. In light of this, we review the current knowledge on causes, consequences, and management of sea urchin overgrazing of seagrasses. Initially we argue that the definition of overgrazing must include scale and impairment of ecosystem services, since this is the de facto definition used in the literature, and will highlight the potential societal costs of seagrass overgrazing. A review of 16 identified cases suggests that urchin overgrazing is a global phenomenon, ranging from temperate to tropical coastal waters and involving at least 11 seagrass and 7 urchin species. Even though most overgrazing events seem to affect areas of &lt;0.5 km 2 , and recovery often occurs within a few years, overgrazing can have a range of large, long-term indirect effects such as loss of associated fauna and decreased sediment stabilization. A range of drivers behind overgrazing have been suggested, including bottom-up (nutrient enrichment), top-down (reduced predation control due to e.g. overfishing), “side-in” mechanisms (e.g. changes in water temperature) and natural population fluctuations. Based on recent studies, there seems to be fairly strong support for the top-down and bottom-up hypotheses. However, many potential drivers often co-occur and interact, especially in areas with high anthropogenic pressure, suggesting that multiple disturbances—by simultaneously reducing predation control, increasing urchin recruitment and reducing the resistance of seagrasses—could pave the way for overgrazing. In management, the most common response to overgrazing has been to remove urchins, but limited knowledge of direct and indirect effects makes it difficult to assess the applicability and sustainability of this method. Based on the wide knowledge gaps, which severely limits management, we suggest that future research should focus on (1) identification and quantification of ecosystem and societal scale effects of overgrazing; (2) assessment of the relative importance and interactions of different drivers; and (3) development of a holistic proactive and reactive long-term management agenda. ]"

This paper reviews the considerable accumulated knowledge of transport processes, sediments, and stratigraphy in this regionally and globally important system. The body of work suggests a small portion (&lt;10%) of the annual sediment load is stored in the system, and the energetic tidal conditions act as a signal filter of sediments depositing in and passing through the delta. Relative to other deltas, the Fly River preserves a muddy stratigraphic record because of its fine-sediment-dominated (∼90%) load and with the aid of fluid-mud processes in the distributary channels. The sediments, morphology, and stratigraphy of Fly River delta are produced by a complex interaction of fluvial, marine, and geological processes . Energetic tidal currents in the delta have produced a morphology characteristic of a tide-dominated delta and a stratigraphy dominated by associated signatures. There remains much to learn about changes in the delta at various space and time scales.

Their morphology is dominantly controlled by the incident wind regime, the topographic obstacle dimensional parameters (e.g., height, width and aspect ratio), spatial alignment and porosity (e.g., blunt body or vegetation covered). Although previous studies have focused on the development of shadow dunes, there are still open issues to be solved. The aim of this study is to review the major studies on shadow dune morphodynamics and to demonstrate up-to-date knowledge on this topic. New results from field observation suggest that shadow dunes could elongate under unimodal wind regimes due to the collective effects of flow deflection around the sand ridge and the intermittent occurrence of salt crust on the dune surface. Shadow dunes always develop in fingering mode on non-erodible bedforms regardless of wind regimes. While obstacle morphology and spatial alignment contribute to shadow dune's initial morphology, the wind regime and sand availability determine their long-term stability. The driving force of shadow dune formation may vary depending on the obstacle scale. For example, the shrub- or nebkha-scale shadow dunes are dominantly controlled by the horizontal separation flow . However, mountain-scale shadow dunes may be caused by the wind seasonal circulation. This study provides new insights into shadow dune morphodynamics and identifies critical future research directions on obstacle-related dunes. ]"

Significant advances in instrumentation are needed to provide the datasets that are required to validate and improve mechanistic models of aeolian sediment transport. Recent advances in robotics show great promise for assisting and amplifying scientists’ efforts to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of many environmental measurements governing sediment transport. The emergence of cheap, agile, human-scale robotic platforms endowed with increasingly sophisticated sensor and motor suites opens up the prospect of deploying programmable, reactive sensor payloads across complex terrain in the service of aeolian science. This paper surveys the need and assesses the opportunities and challenges for amassing novel, highly resolved spatiotemporal datasets for aeolian research using partially-automated ground mobility. We review the limitations of existing measurement approaches for aeolian processes, and discuss how they may be transformed by ground-based robotic platforms, using examples from our initial field experiments. We then review how the need to traverse challenging aeolian terrains and simultaneously make high-resolution measurements of critical variables requires enhanced robotic capability. Finally, we conclude with a look to the future, in which robotic platforms may operate with increasing autonomy in harsh conditions. Besides expanding the completeness of terrestrial datasets, bringing ground-based robots to the aeolian research community may lead to unexpected discoveries that generate new hypotheses to expand the science itself. ]"

Climate-induced forcing on upwelling can alter size structure-composition of zooplankton. Biological communities of upwelling systems are reorganizing upon ongoing climate change. , A 10-year time series (2002–2012) at Station 18 off central/southern Chile allowed us to study variations in zooplankton along with interannual variability and trends in oceanographic conditions. We used an automated analysis program (ZooImage) to assess changes in the mesozooplankton size structure and the composition of the taxa throughout the entire community. Oceanographic conditions changed over the decade: the water column became less stratified, more saline, and colder; the mixed layer deepened; and the oxygen minimum zone became shallower during the second half of the time series (2008–2012) in comparison with the first period (2002–2007). Both the size structure and composition of the zooplankton were significantly associated with oceanographic changes. Taxonomic and size diversity of the zooplankton community increased to the more recent period. For the second period, small sized copepods (&lt;1 mm) decreased in abundance, being replaced by larger sized (&gt;1.5 mm) and medium size copepods (1–1.5 mm), whereas euphausiids, decapod larvae, appendicularian and ostracods increased their abundance during the second period. These findings indicated that the zooplankton community structure in this eastern boundary ecosystem was strongly influenced by variability of the upwelling process. Thus, climate-induced forcing of upwelling trends can alter the zooplankton community in this highly productive region with potential consequences for the ecosystem food web. ]"

Landsat critical for demonstrating capacity and science role of earth observation. Science-quality data for understanding the earth system and policy development. Quantitative documentation of global change during the Anthropocene. Success due to dedicated calibration, geolocation, and collection reprocessing. , Since 1972, the Landsat program has been continually monitoring the Earth, to now provide 50 years of digital, multispectral, medium spatial resolution observations. Over this time, Landsat data were crucial for many scientific and technical advances. Prior to the Landsat program, detailed, synoptic depictions of the Earth's surface were rare, and the ability to acquire and work with large datasets was limited. The early years of the Landsat program delivered a series of technological breakthroughs, pioneering new methods, and demonstrating the ability and capacity of digital satellite imagery, creating a template for other global Earth observation missions and programs. Innovations driven by the Landsat program have paved the way for subsequent science, application, and policy support activities. The economic and scientific value of the knowledge gained through the Landsat program has been long recognized, and despite periods of funding uncertainty, has resulted in the program's 50 years of continuity, as well as substantive and ongoing improvements to payload and mission performance. Free and open access to Landsat data, enacted in 2008, was unprecedented for medium spatial resolution Earth observation data and substantially increased usage and led to a proliferation of science and application opportunities. Here, we highlight key developments over the past 50 years of the Landsat program that have influenced and changed our scientific understanding of the Earth system. Major scientific and programmatic impacts have been realized in the areas of agricultural crop mapping and water use, climate change drivers and impacts, ecosystems and land cover monitoring, and mapping the changing human footprint. The introduction of Landsat collection processing, coupled with the free and open data policy, facilitated a transition in Landsat data usage away from single images and towards time series analyses over large areas and has fostered the widespread use of science-grade data. The launch of Landsat-9 on September 27, 2021, and the advanced planning of its successor mission, Landsat-Next, underscore the sustained institutional support for the program. Such support and commitment to continuity is recognition of both the historic impact the program, and the future potential to build upon Landsat's remarkable 50-year legacy. ]"

Existing risk assessment frameworks have not been developed in the context of NBS. Social and ecological aspects are not equally addressed in existing frameworks. A vulnerability and risk assessment framework in the context of NBS is proposed. 135 social-ecological indicators are provided as a reference for risk assessment. , Nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly being implemented as suitable approaches for reducing vulnerability and risk of social-ecological systems (SES) to hydro-meteorological hazards. Understanding vulnerability and risk of SES is crucial in order to design and implement NBS projects appropriately. A systematic literature review was carried out to examine the suitability of, or gaps in, existing frameworks for vulnerability and risk assessment of SES to hydro-meteorological hazards. The review confirms that very few frameworks have been developed in the context of NBS. Most of the frameworks have emphasised social systems over ecological systems. Furthermore, they have not explicitly considered the temporal dimension of risk reduction measures. The study proposes an indicator-based vulnerability and risk assessment framework in the context of NBS (VR-NBS) that addresses both the above limitations and considers established NBS principles. The framework aims to allow for a better consideration of the multiple benefits afforded by NBS and which impact all the dimensions of risk. A list of 135 indicators is identified through literature review and surveys in NBS project sites. This list is composed of indicators representing the social sub-system (61% of total indicators) and the ecological sub-system (39% of total indicators). The list will act as a reference indicator library in the context of NBS projects and will be regularly updated as lessons are learnt. While the proposed VR-NBS framework is developed considering hydro-meteorological hazards and NBS, it can be adapted for other natural hazards and different types of risk reduction measures. ]"

In China, impacts of climate change were more harm than benefit while more warming was very likely to aggravate the risk. , Climate warming and subsequent climate extremes have a wide impact on ecosystems and economic society. Scientifically quantitative assessment on climate change risks is an urgent issue attracted the attention of academics and decision-makers. In this paper, the theory of climate change risks was sorted out based on the three component elements of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure. Moreover, the idiomatic assessment methods and their applicability were systematically summarized. Comprehensive analysis found that the impacts of climate change generally showed a negative trend that was more harm than benefit, and further warming would aggravate the risk over China which was manifested to be more prominent in some sensitive sectors and key regions to climate change.

Erosion, sedimentation, sea-level change are dominant factors in groundwater dynamics. Presently, groundwater is hardly being recharged due to low conductivity top layer. , Study region Mekong Delta, Vietnam (MKD). Study focus Present-day distribution of fresh-saline groundwater is highly heterogeneous in the MKD. Close to the coastline, fresh groundwater is found in aquifers up to 500 m below ground surface. To gain better insight into the fresh-saline groundwater evolution since the late Pleistocene, we simulated long-term groundwater flow and salt transport in a two-dimensional NW-SW cross-section over the MKD. To fully consider the regression and transgression phases of sea-level changes over the past 60 ka, variable-density groundwater flow and salt transport was simulated with SEAWAT to reproduce characteristics of the present-day distribution of fresh-saline groundwater and its age. We simulated nine scenarios to evaluate the most important factors controlling freshening and salinization processes of the MKD groundwater system. We compared the final model stage with present day observations of groundwater salinity and age. New hydrological insights for the region The sedimentation and erosion processes, related to sea-level changes over the last 60 ka, were important drivers of the fresh-saline distribution in the present MKD. The two-dimensional model indicates that most fresh groundwater in the MKD was recharged 60–12 ka before present, when the sea-level was at its lowest and the top sedimentary layers had a relatively high permeability. Due to deposition of a clayey top layer during the Holocene, at present, groundwater recharge of the deeper MKD groundwater system is very limited. ]"

Microplastics (MPs), plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, are contaminants widespread across all environmental compartments, including remote ecosystems. Thus, MPs could serve as geological proxies of the Anthropocene , a proposed geological epoch characterized for the human-derived influence on the environment.

This review article describes the current state of our understanding of the atmospheric sulfur cycle, focusing on the marine atmospheric boundary layer, with the aim of identifying the largest roots of uncertainty that most inhibit accurate simulation of sulfur cycling in the atmosphere. An overview of the emissions by phytoplankton and shipping, dispersion and entrainment in the marine boundary layer, and chemical processing by aerosols, clouds, and dry deposition is presented.

In this mode, the public is not simply a passive recipient of expert knowledge but a co-producer of risk knowledge. We argue that disaster risk reduction requires a reorientation based on a foundation built on three areas of research: (1) Indigenous and local knowledge, (2) social learning, and (3) narrative ways of knowing.

The most abundant transparent heavy minerals observed in the core are amphibole , epidote , iron-titanium oxides, metamorphic minerals (garnet, sillimanite , kyanite , staurolite , chloritoid), pyroxene , zircon , tourmaline , rutile and apatite . Heavy minerals found in lower quantities are sphene , monazite , allanite and siderite . Also present in the heavy mineral separates are rock fragments, authigenic framboidal pyrite and pyritised foraminifera. Relative abundances of heavy minerals suggest one main source of sediment to the delta plain during the late Pleistocene to early Holocene and the addition of another source in the late Holocene. Proximal sources west of the southern Yangtze delta plain, including bedrock of the southern delta plain itself (Jurassic to Cretaceous igneous rocks, Precambrian medium-grade metamorphic rocks and Palaeozoic to Mesozoic carbonate sequences) and the western Mao-shan and Tian-mu-shan highlands (Palaeozoic to Mesozoic clastics and carbonate rocks), most likely were the source of late Pleistocene to early Holocene fluvial sediments . These sediments were carried eastward in river channels originating in the highlands. A complex of fluvial channels that migrated southward across the delta plain during the late Holocene added an additional source of sediment to the delta plain. They originated from western and northern distal source areas similar to those exposed in the modern Yangtze drainage basin. Evidence from heavy minerals supports previous studies of the core that document the tectonic and palaeoenvironmental history of the southern Yangtze delta plain. In particular, prior to 10,000 years B.P., the southern Yangtze delta plain supported the formation of an oxidising soil when sea level was low and heavy mineral influx came from proximal sources. During the period from 10,000 to 7000 years B.P., an open coastal setting characterised the southern delta plain region. Pyrite in heavy mineral separates, representing the period between 7000 and 4000 years B.P., supports evidence from other studies indicating that lagoons and freshwater marshes created reducing conditions during this time period. As sea level approached its present level 4000 years B.P., tectonically induced differential subsidence of the Yangtze delta plain progressed from north to south. Heavy mineral input to the delta plain reflects the resultant southward migration of the Yangtze river channel and deltaic depocentre to its present position. ]"

In particular, independent but correlatable stratigraphic scales for the Permian deposits of Verkhoyanie, Siberian Platform, and Taimyr are highlighted. Stage-level correlation of these Permian successions with the international Permian chronostratigraphic scale is possible only for Verkhoyanie based on ammonoid and bivalve faunas and limited geochronology ; for other regions (Siberian Platform and Taimyr), stage-level correlation with the international Permian timescale is achievable via Verkhoyanie through the use of a combination of both marine (including ammonoids, brachiopods, marine bivalves) and plant fossils. On the basis of the synthesized and updated stratigraphic framework and using sedimentological and paleontological indicators, four stage-level regional paleogeographic reconstruction maps are provided: the Sakmarian–Early Artinskian and Roadian intervals represent times of transgression maxima that have been traced in Central Siberia , and the other two intervals (Late Kungurian and Late Capitanian) demonstrate times of regression maxima that are characterized by thick coal accumulations in many Late Paleozoic coal-bearing basins of Central Siberia. ]"

In order to exploit clay minerals as palaeoenvironmental proxies, these must be extracted from their host carbonate prior to analysis. Over the last decades, efforts to optimize experimental procedures for the extraction of carbonate-hosted clay minerals resulted in a wide range of laboratory protocols (e.g., hydrochloric acid , acetic acid, formic acid or cation-exchange resins). Specifically, the risk that the extraction procedures damage the clay fraction merits attention. Standard decarbonatation procedures established for clay-lean, pelagic carbonates may provide redundant or unsatisfactory results when applied to terrigenous shallow-water carbonates. Here, we focus on mineralogically complex shallow-water carbonate materials and review, test and discuss different decarbonatation procedures in a process-oriented context. By exploring the significance of clay minerals for palaeoenvironmental and diagenetic interpretations, the relevance of the clay fraction as a key proxy is highlighted. Selected case studies are presented and by this, we intend to test and discus the most commonly reported decarbonatation procedures using representative cases of natural mixed carbonate-siliciclastic facies including a variable degree of dolomitization . These experiments show a differential behaviour when applied to pure and mixed natural materials. For mixed carbonate-clastic facies , the relative increase in quartz and dolomite intensity peaks (where present) obscured further identification of non-carbonate minerals. This pattern is observed despite the effective dissolution of calcite at higher acetic acid concentration (2N). Dolomitized limestone samples were addressed, but remained largely unresponsive to all tested pre-treatment procedures. Due to complexities inherent to the presence of dolomite in polymineralic natural samples, further work is necessary to clarify their resilience to decarbonatation procedures, as well as to the impact of dolomitization as such with regard to the clay fraction. For calcite dominated lithologies (here oolitic limestone), the use of acetic acid at higher concentration (2N) resulted in the most efficient decarbonatation. With reference to &gt;95% carbonate-bearing limestones and dolostones , the application of elevated fluid temperatures (50°C) improved the reaction rates and the efficiency of the dissolution steps. With regard to mixed carbonate-clastic facies, elevated fluid temperatures of up to 50°C imposed considerable damage to the clay fraction, showing significantly reduced intensity peaks when compared to room temperature conditions at similar acid concentration. Moreover, it was demonstrated that: (i) bulk and insoluble residues show no major differences regarding their mineralogical composition; and that (ii) acetic acid at 2N is the best approach to ensure the preservation of the clay fraction. Conversely, the application of hydrochloric acid tests, a commonly used chemical in many published protocols, resulted in the least satisfactorily results. The potential bias induced by various clay-extraction methods is put to the test in the form of a representative case study, reflecting a series of distinct paleoenvironmental scenarios. ]"

At each scale of observation (i.e., hierarchical level), the building blocks of the sequence stratigraphic framework are represented by sequences and their component systems tracts and depositional systems. At the smallest stratigraphic scales, systems tracts and component depositional systems consist solely of sedimentological cycles (i.e., beds and bedsets). At any larger scales, systems tracts and depositional systems consist of lower rank stratigraphic cycles (i.e., sequences). The stacking pattern of sedimentological cycles defines the lowest rank systems tracts, which are the smallest stratigraphic units of a sequence stratigraphic framework. The scale of the lowest rank systems tracts at any location defines the highest stratigraphic resolution that can be achieved, and the limit between sedimentology and stratigraphy sensu stricto . The formation of depositional systems, and implicitly of systems tracts, requires typically minimum timescales of 10 2 yrs, and it may be sustained for as long as the defining environments are maintained as dominant sediment fairways. Within the transit area of a shoreline , where changes in depositional environment are most frequent, only the lowest rank depositional systems consist strictly of process-related facies accumulated in specific environments; these depositional systems sensu stricto develop commonly at scales below the resolution of seismic stratigraphy . At larger scales (higher hierarchical ranks), depositional systems sensu lato reflect dominant depositional trends, but may record higher frequency changes in depositional environment. The distinction between depositional systems sensu stricto and sensu lato becomes less meaningful outside of the shoreline transit area, where stratigraphic cyclicity may develop without changes in depositional environment. High-frequency sequences are commonly observed at scales of 10 0 –10 1 m and 10 2 –10 5 yrs, which defines the scope of high-resolution sequence stratigraphy . The stacking pattern of high-frequency sequences defines depositional systems and systems tracts of higher hierarchical ranks in lower resolution studies. ]"

Our synthesis includes 47 records from a recently published database of highly resolved Holocene paleoclimate time series from the Arctic (Sundqvist et al., 2014). We analyze the temperature histories represented by the database and compare them with paleoclimate and environmental information from 54 additional published records, mostly from datasets that did not fit the selection criteria for the Arctic Holocene database. Combined, we review evidence from a variety of proxy archives including glaciers (ice cores and glacial geomorphology), lake sediments , peat sequences, and coastal and deep-marine sediments. The temperature-sensitive records indicate more consistent and earlier Holocene warmth in the north and east, and a more diffuse and later Holocene thermal maximum in the south and west. Principal components analysis reveals two dominant Holocene trends, one with early Holocene warmth followed by cooling in the middle Holocene, the other with a broader period of warmth in the middle Holocene followed by cooling in the late Holocene. The temperature decrease from the warmest to the coolest portions of the Holocene is 3.0 ± 1.0 °C on average (n = 11 sites). The Greenland Ice Sheet retracted to its minimum extent between 5 and 3 ka, consistent with many sites from around Greenland depicting a switch from warm to cool conditions around that time. The spatial pattern of temperature change through the Holocene was likely driven by the decrease in northern latitude summer insolation through the Holocene, the varied influence of waning ice sheets in the early Holocene, and the variable influx of Atlantic Water into the study region. ]"

The wave regime was found to be characterised by highly energetic conditions during the winter, with storm events leading to waves of significant heights exceeding 5 m with mean periods of over 10 s. Prevailing southerly winds force a downwelling regime over the shelf with poleward flow at mid-shelf (~10–20 cm/s) and offshore transport in the bottom Ekman layer. Episodic strong upwelling events can occur during this period, leading to important changes in the near bottom stratification at mid-shelf.

A step forward based on Congo and SW African river muds ],"[ Despite the influence of other geological and geomorphological factors, chemical weathering at the Earth's surface is strongly controlled by climate. Thus, a measure of weathering intensity determined from soils or sediments should provide information about the climatic conditions associated with their formation. Available geochemical and mineralogical data on modern fluvial and marine muds from different regions of southern Africa and its Atlantic continental margin are used to review the links between sediment composition and climatic properties together with the possible causes of variance. Although river muds may not be generated exclusively in a single sedimentary cycle and erosion and weathering processes do not necessarily take place in a spatially homogeneous way, significant relationships between mineralogical and geochemical signatures of river mud and rainfall in the corresponding catchment area were recognised. Our study shows that the composition of clay is strongly influenced by climatically-driven weathering, whilst coarser mud fractions tend to be more affected by provenance, grain size, hydraulic sorting, and recycling. In the marine environment the climatic signal may be lost even in clay, because of hydraulic fractionation, authigenic mineral growth and mixing with foreign particles. Given the ubiquitous character of fluvial muds, and the easy and non-expensive methods available for separating and analysing clay fractions, their geochemical fingerprints represent a most precious source of information concerning climate. Any geochemical parameter used as a regional proxy of climate, however, still requires that the diversity of geological, geomorphological, and biological factors that affect its value are cautiously considered. ]"

The modern practice of seismic hazard assessment rests on these principles and may rely on them, but also requires a detailed knowledge of the location and characteristics of individual earthquake sources. We discuss how this knowledge base can be constructed, with an eye on the geological history , which provides a record of the faults capable of generating large earthquakes, and one on the human history , which supplies evidence for whether, where and how these faults have actually caused damaging earthquakes in the past. How do these two records interact with each other? It is now accepted that identifying active and potentially seismogenic faults in Italy is especially hard. The geological record may be clear and honest when dealing with processes at the scale of several million years, but can be very difficult to decipher if we are concerned with contemporary geological processes , such as earthquakes. Shortening the tim E-W indow of observation of earthquake activity is why Historical Seismology is so crucial for constructing a seismogenic source model. To this end we exploited a number of key Italian destructive earthquakes, each of which illuminates a recent geological process that may not offer a discernible surface signature. Our findings led us to reconsider the tectonic style of large areas, changed our perception of their earthquake potential, hinted at the existence of unknown seismogenic zones, and even led to downsizing the magnitude of the largest Italian historical earthquakes. We maintain that the complexity of the geological setting may be counterbalanced by the richness of the historical earthquake record. We also believe that our experience in the combined investigation of Italy’s historical earthquakes and seismogenic sources may be replicated in all earthquake-prone countries that exhibit a history of human settlement throughout the millennia. ]"

Fluvial system structure is presented in the first section of the paper along with permafrost controls over its functioning, which vary across fluvial system compartments. The distinction is drawn between primarily fluvial landforms that are expected to adjust to future hydrology with less permafrost constraints, and primarily cryogenic landforms evolving in line with permafrost disturbances. The influence of permafrost on fluvial action varies across compartments: on hillslopes , permafrost mostly controls the occurrence of surface runoff, in river valleys and channels, sediment erodibility , while thermal interaction is essential for growing thermo-erosional gullies. Observed and projected changes in permafrost and hydrology are outlined, and their relevance for cryo-fluvial evolution of fluvial systems is reviewed. Based on these projections, future changes in fluvial action in each compartment are discussed. On hillslopes , where permafrost exerts important controls on hillslope hydrology, fluvial activity of overland flow is expected to decrease following the active layer deepening and decreased overland flow duration. In erosional networks, controlled by thermal interaction between runoff and permafrost terrain, higher water temperature is expected to increase the occurrence and rates of thermo-erosional gully development. In river valleys and channels, where permafrost controls the erodibility of bed and bank material, the expected fluvial feedbacks vary across scales and stream orders, and include changes in seasonality of channel deformations, increased retreat rates in lower river banks and decreased, in higher banks, along with floodplain subsidence , and minor potential for complete destabilization of existing channel patterns. Future collateral effects of fluvial change include alterations of terrestrial biogeochemical cycles and societal impact that must be accounted for in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. ]"

These protists are, similar to reef-building corals, photosymbiotic, restricted to warm (&gt; 14 °C) seawater temperatures, and to benthic habitats within the photic zone . Because of their abundance, similarities to corals, short life-spans, and sensitivity to water quality, LBF are widely applied in environmental assessments of reef habitats. I review data on alive LBF assemblages within their environmental context. To be able to do so, I review the occurrences of individual species of the, in most environments, most abundant Central Indo-Pacific LBF, the Amphisteginidae, Calcarinidae, and Nummulitidae. In doing so I highlight the large uncertainties with respect to ecophenotypic and genetic variation among populations. In each of these families there appears to be substantial cryptic diversity, and thorough investigation using new morphological techniques results in higher diversity than previously known. Field observations of LBF show that nutrient availability, hydrodynamic energy, light intensity and spectrum, substrate type (sand, rubble, rubble with sand, algae, sea grass), and temperature are important environmental parameters for the occurrence of individual species. Many of these parameters are interrelated and are in some way influenced by water depth at least in part because occurrences have been related to conditions in the overlying watercolumn, and not to the microhabitat within the benthic boundary layer where the LBF live. In addition, I argue that differences in tolerance to terrestrial influence among species plays a large role in the occurrences of LBF, not only on the predominantly hard substratum reefs, but also in the predominantly sandy substratum inter-reef areas. Hence, there are distinct assemblages on reefs surrounded by deep, oceanic water, compared to terrestrially influenced reefs. Furthermore, assemblage composition is not only determined by water-quality parameters, but also by ecological dynamics of the benthic habitat on coral reefs, including shifts away from high coral cover. Abrupt changes resulting in permanent or temporal changes in the benthic habitat of coral reefs result in changes in the LBF assemblage. Especially calcarinids become more abundant with increased algal cover. Assemblage composition of benthic foraminifera , especially the weighted contribution of LBF to the total benthic foraminifera assemblage (the FoRAM Index), has been used to provide an assessment of water quality. Here I show that, in the Central Indo-Pacific, several species of LBF can occur abundantly in nearshore settings experiencing high terrestrial run-off. For a more consistent application of this method, the sampling and processing protocols (e.g., depth, sieve fractions included) should be standardised. Furthermore, differences in regional species pools require regional calibrations of the method, or finding alternative ways of simple assessments of reef quality using LBF. ]"

Reconstructing the timing of surface uplift for each of the different Andean regions is of crucial importance for our understanding of continental-scale moisture transport and atmospheric circulation , the origin and evolution of the Amazon River and Rainforest, and ultimately, the origin and evolution of species on the world most biodiverse continent. Here, I present (1) a compilation of estimates of paleoelevation for 36 geomorphological domains of the Andes from the literature, and (2) a paleoelevation reconstruction of the Andes since 80 Ma. In the northern Andes, uplift started in the Late Cretaceous (~70 Ma) in the Western and Central Cordilleras of Ecuador, while the northwestern corner of the continent was still covered by shallow seas. Mountain building migrated progressively northwards, with the Perija Range and Santander Massif uplifting since the Oligocene and the Eastern Cordillera , Garzon Massif and Mérida Andes since the Miocene . In the central Andes, uplift migrated from west to east, whereby the main phase of uplift in the Western Cordillera took place during the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene, in the western Puna plateau during the Paleocene, in the eastern Puna plateau during the early-mid Miocene, and in the Altiplano and Eastern Cordillera during the mid-late Miocene. In the southern Patagonian Andes, significant elevation was already in place at 80 Ma and in western Patagonia, modern elevations were reached in the early Eocene . A second pulse of uplift and eastward migration of the orogenic front occurred during the early-mid Miocene. The reconstruction developed here is made available as a series of raster files, so that it can be used as input for a variety of studies in the solid Earth, climate, and biological sciences, thereby being a stepping stone on the path towards a better understanding of the coevolution of the solid Earth, landscapes, climate, and life in South America. ]"

Steep morphologies facilitate the transport by oceanic currents of organic pollutants. Passive sampling offers an opportunity to assess the impact of pollution on deep seas. , The deep sea - an oceanic layer below 200 m depths – has important global biogeochemical and nutrient cycling functions. It also receives organic pollutants from anthropogenic sources, which threatens the ecological function of the deep sea. In this Review, critically examined data on the distribution of organic pollutants in the deep sea to outline the role of biogeochemical and geophysical factors on the global distribution and regional chemodynamics of organic pollutants in the deep sea. We found that the contribution of deep water formation to the influx of perfluorinated compounds reached a maximum, following peak emission, faster in young deep waters (&lt; 10 years) compared to older deep waters (&gt; 100 years). For example, perfluorinated compounds had low concentrations (&lt; 10 pg L −1 ) and vertical variations in the South Pacific Ocean where the ocean currents are old (&lt; 1000 years). Steep geomorphologies of submarine canyons, ridges, and valleys facilitated the transport of sediments and associated organic pollutants by oceanic currents from the continental shelf to remote deep seas. In addition, we found that, even though an estimated 1.2–4.2 million metric tons of plastic debris enter the ocean through riverine discharge annually, the role of microplastics as vectors of organic pollutants ( e.g. , plastic monomers, additives, and attached organic pollutants) in the deep sea is often overlooked. Finally, we recommend assessing the biological effects of organic pollutants in deep sea biota, large-scale monitoring of organic pollutants, reconstructing historical emissions using sediment cores, and assessing the impact of deep-sea mining on the ecosystem. ]"

The same types of stacking patterns may be observed at different scales, in relation to stratigraphic cycles of different magnitudes. At each scale of observation, stacking patterns define systems tracts, and changes in stacking pattern mark the position of sequence stratigraphic surfaces. The construction of a framework of systems tracts and bounding surfaces fulfills the practical purpose of sequence stratigraphy . Beyond this framework, model-dependent choices with respect to the selection of the ‘sequence boundary’ may be made as a function of the mappability of the various types of sequence stratigraphic surface within the studied section. Sequence stratigraphic frameworks are basin-specific in terms of timing and scales of the component units and bounding surfaces, reflecting the interplay of global and local controls on accommodation and sedimentation. A stratigraphic sequence corresponds to a cycle of change in stratal stacking patterns, defined by the recurrence of the same type of sequence stratigraphic surface in the rock record. Sequences, as well as component systems tracts and depositional systems, can be observed at all stratigraphic scales. Sequences of any scale may include unconformities of equal and/or lower hierarchical ranks, whose identification depends on the resolution of the data available. The relative ranking of sequences of different scales is defined by their stratigraphic relationships, as lower rank sequences are nested within higher rank systems tracts. Despite this nested architecture, the stratigraphic framework is not truly fractal because sequences of different scales may differ in terms of underlying controls and internal composition of systems tracts. A scale-independent approach to methodology and nomenclature is key to the standard application of sequence stratigraphy across the entire range of geological settings, stratigraphic scales, and types of data available. ]"

Hydrology will depend on appropriate use of process-based models. , Process-based hydrological models have a long history dating back to the 1960s. Criticized by some as over-parameterized, overly complex, and difficult to use, a more nuanced view is that these tools are necessary in many situations and, in a certain class of problems, they are the most appropriate type of hydrological model. This is especially the case in situations where knowledge of flow paths or distributed state variables and/or preservation of physical constraints is important. Examples of this include: spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture, groundwater flow and runoff generation, sediment and contaminant transport, or when feedbacks among various Earth’s system processes or understanding the impacts of climate non-stationarity are of primary concern. These are situations where process-based models excel and other models are unverifiable. This article presents this pragmatic view in the context of existing literature to justify the approach where applicable and necessary. We review how improvements in data availability, computational resources and algorithms have made detailed hydrological simulations a reality.

The most typical metamorphic lithofacies , in the Pisan Mts. of Tuscany, is represented by the Verrucano s.s. conglomerates and breccias, including quartz clasts and minor metamorphic and volcanic lithics, grading laterally and vertically to quartzitic sandstones and pelites. In the Pisa Symposium the term ‘Verrucano’ was suggested only for those detrital deposits laid down, in the Alpine-Mediterranean areas, after the final act of the Variscan orogeny , and also to use local geographical names. Consequently, the typical terms ‘Verrucano Toscano’, the ‘Verrucano Lombardo’, the ‘Verrucano Briançonnais’ and other similar deposits, being linked to the Variscan belt, were generally accepted. The ages of these ‘Verrucanos’, since they are devoid of fossils, can only be interpreted indirectly. The Verrucano Lombardo of central Southern Alps was recently ascribed to a Mid? –Late Permian interval (Late Guadalupian ?–Lopingian p.p .), taking into account that the connected Val Gardena Sandstones of the nearby Venetian region are interdigitated with the Late Permian Bellerophon Fm. The Verrucano Briançonnais of the Maritime Alps is again mostly related to Late Permian, being covered by the Lower Triassic alluvial-deltaic quartzites . In the easternmost Ligurian Apennines, near La Spezia, the Mesozoic section of Punta Bianca, which begins with a fluvial conglomerate, transgressive and unconformable on a metamorphosed Paleozoic Variscan Basement, is composed of two main cycles, of which the upper one correlates to the typical Pisan Verrucano s.s . and the overlying Mt. Serra Quartzites, the latter yielding Carnian pelecypods and vertebrate footprints. The Verrucano from the Mid-Tuscan Ridge to Mt. Leoni and in the Argentario promontory is delimited above by the Tocchi Formation and presumably developed from Middle (Late? Ladinian) up to Late Triassic (Carnian) times; in contrast, in Calabria ( e.g. the Longobucco unit of Sila Grande) and in Sicily ( e.g. the Taormina-Longi Unit of Peloritani Mts.) the so-called (Pseudo-) Verrucano deposits pertain to Mid? –Late Triassic and are capped by a basal Jurassic succession, determined by the discovery of an Early Hettangian palynoflora. All over their distribution areas, the above-mentioned Alpine Verrucanos rest, through an unconformity marked by a gap of varying and imprecise duration, on Late Paleozoic volcanic/sedimentary successions or directly on the underlying Variscan metamorphic basement. Schematically, the post-Variscan succession in Italy can be subdivided into three main tectono-sedimentary megacycles: the first generally ranges from the Late Carboniferous to, or slightly above the Early Permian, the second from Mid? –Late Permian to Middle Triassic , while the third cycle begins with the Mid?-Late Triassic p.p., attaining the Jurassic in some parts of Southern Tuscany and the ‘Calabro-Peloritani Arc’. After the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian transtensional tectonics represented by many strike-slip continental basins (cycle I), widespread Middle Permian geodynamic reorganization (‘Mid-Permian Episode’ Auctt. ) led to the development of a dominant extensional regime, and the birth of tectonic plates and oceans (Neotethys, Meliata-Maliak, etc.) between Africa and Europe. The erosion of the Variscan relief was followed by ingression from S-E sectors of shallow-marine branches of Neotethys (cycle II). The major rifting events that led to the Jurassic birth of the Ligurian-Piedmont Ocean started during the Middle–Late Triassic, and were related to the eastern opening of the Atlantic Ocean. These rifting events gave rise to the development of the Adria and Europe-Corsica-Sardinia conjugate passive margins, characterized by an asymmetric structural and sedimentary evolution. In this geological context, the Verrucano-like deposits of Italy can be interpreted as a discontinuous and asynchronous ‘tectofacies’ that marks the final dismantling of the SE border of the Variscan chain. ]"

While the emphasis is directed at High Arctic systems, literature and recent developments from other Arctic regions are also included. Hydrological change , particularly a shift from nival (snowmelt) dominance to increasing pluvial (rainfall) runoff contributions has important consequences for the timing and magnitude of hydrological fluxes. A key distinction is made between thermal perturbation , where changing melt season thaw conditions result in deep thaw with minimal geomorphic or surface hydrological effects, in contrast to physical perturbation , where permafrost change results in some form of thermokarst or physical disturbance such as mass movement or enhanced erosion. The latter disturbances are commonly expressed as localized thermo erosional gullies, active layer detachments and retrogressive thaw slumps. Results from recent research emphasise the importance of hydrological connectivity in terms of the downstream effect of a particular permafrost perturbation. Well-connected systems, either at the surface as channelized flows, or in the subsurface, through new or altered active layer flow pathways, result in substantial changes in downstream fluvial fluxes. Surface hydrological connectivity of localized permafrost disturbances increases transport of suspended sediment and particulate organic matter , the latter of which is often old and comparatively labile. Exposed ice in retrogressive thaw slumps sustains discharge during the melt season, further increasing fluxes. Thermal perturbation holds a substantially greater potential downstream impact due to widespread mobilization of solutes and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, and several studies point to rapid microbial alteration of carbon and inorganic nitrogen transformation in the shallow subsurface. Collectively, these results point to altered runoff, sediment transport and hydrochemical fluxes with spatial and hydrological controls. ]"

Four aspects are covered: knowledge of urban flood flow and transport processes, stability of humans and objects within flooded streets, reliability of computational modelling and approaches for speeding-up computations of urban flood event. New laboratory setups have shed light on previously unexplored processes such as flow intrusion into buildings or contaminant exchanges between surface and underground drainage. The stability of a single pedestrians or object (e.g., vehicles, waste containers) under urban flooding was analysed, but not group effects such as clogging. Improvements in computations were achieved by new strategies for merging and processing various sources of high quality topographic and forcing data (e.g., precipitation), the incorporation of more and more details on the drainage systems (e.g., effect of gullies), and 3D instead of 2D simulations. Computational efficiency was enhanced based on massive parallelization, adaptive mesh, porosity models, surrogate models as well as machine learning.

Geochemistry of the samples suggests that Carboniferous to Jurassic magmatism in the Andean region is subduction-related. Crustal thinning and increase of mantle contribution to magmas are explained by lithospheric delamination/thermal erosion. , The proto-Andean and Early Andean evolution of the southwestern Gondwana margin comprises three stages that differ in their magmatic evolution and deformational style: the Gondwana cycle (~330–280 Ma), the Pre-Andean stage (~280–210 Ma) and the Early Andean Cycle (210–100 Ma). These stages have been traditionally interpreted as the upper crustal response to changes in the tectonic setting which include: Cordilleran-style continental arc (Gondwana cycle), orogenic collapse and possibly slab break-off that led to continental rifting and extensive crustal melting (Pre-Andean stage), and subsequent subduction re-initiation in oceanic arc-style context (Early Andean cycle). The petrological and geochemical characteristics of Carboniferous to Jurassic igneous rocks from this region however do not support the described model. Elemental and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data of 86 samples, along with a compilation of ~1230 samples from the literature suggest that subduction was the most likely process by which the magmatic record was generated. Sub-alkaline affinities, LILE enrichment over HFSE, Nb Ta troughs, porphyritic textures and hornblende- and biotite-bearing lithologies are present in all studied units, whereas isotopes suggest that magma sources are a mixture of depleted mantle and variable contribution from the continental crust . Even though the aforementioned features are common to all igneous rocks, some changes point to a decline in the contribution of crustal/lithospheric sources to the magmatism with time. Thus, SiO 2 , La N /Yb N and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr initial exhibit a systematic decrease from ~285 to 150 Ma, whereas the εNd initial parameter increases in the same period. These changes were accompanied by the shift from dominant compressional (Carboniferous-Early Permian) to transtentional (Middle Permian-Jurassic) stresses in the upper crust , suggesting that the margin went from advancing to retreating due to Pangea reorganization and break-up. Following a potential flat slab event, slab roll-back may have induced extension in the upper crust and lithospheric loss as a consequence of delamination or thermal erosion. ]"

Offshore channelized-lobe-type hyperpycnites are linked to Nereites ichnofacies. , Hyperpycnal flows have been widely described in different lacustrine and marine environments but sedimentary structures and fossil content in hyperpycnites often offer limited information about the palaeoenvironmental conditions. This limitation can be improved by ichnological analysis, which has been recently used as a tool to differentiate between different type of subaqueous deposits, even though still only a few detailed ichnological studies on hyperpycnites exist. In order to bridge this gap in knowledge, a 50 m-thick package of terrestrial organic debris-rich, dominantly structureless and well-sorted sandstone bodies alternating with burrowed siltstones (Upper Miocene , Betic Cordillera , Spain) is here analyzed. This study is based on observations of a well-exposed outcrop and cores from a well drilled just behind the outcrop to bridge field-scale observational gaps. Two type of sandbodies were typified on the basis of their stratigraphic architecture, physical sedimentary structures, and ichnofacies in the fine-grained deposits embedding them: (1) Lobate to channelized-top sandstones embebbed into silty sands with dominant highly variable degree of bioturbation by Taenidium and Schaubcylindrichnus (depauperate Cruziana ichnofacies) and interpreted as proximal marine sustained hyperpycnites in prodelta settings; and (2) channelized-lobate (cut-and-fill sequence) sandstones embebbed into siltstones with dominant Nereites and Phycosiphon ( Nereites ichnofacies) interpreted as distal hyperpycnites developed in offshore settings. The studied succession is interpreted to represent the progradation of a sandy hyperpycnal system along a prodelta to starved offshore setting with high variability in grain-size, benthic food and oxygen content. Results of this study suggest that a multi-scale analysis focused on trace fossils and physical sedimentary signatures is needed to get a better understanding of these river-derived sustained-flow turbidites (hyperpycnites) that are less well known than their conventional surge-type turbidite counterparts. ]"

Existing studies reveal that event-scale C-Q relationships are mostly non-linear and exhibit temporal lags between peaks (or troughs) of hydrographs and chemographs, resulting in apparent hysteresis effects.

In addition, this paper provides a typical workflow to conduct event-scale hysteresis analysis, such as how to obtain the access to high-frequency measurements, existing methods to delineate storm events, approaches to classify and quantify hysteresis patterns, possible features/properties controlling hysteresis patterns, statistical methods to identify features at play, and strategies to deliver the inferences from hysteresis analysis.

It develops progressively landward during shoreface retreat due to wave action, which erodes the substrate and leads to sediment bypass in the offshore direction. The WRS may rework previously formed surfaces, such as the maximum regressive surface (also known as the transgressive surface) and the subaerial unconformity , becoming a systems tract and/or sequence boundary. Due to the associated lithological contrast between underlying and overlying deposits and the presence of lags and/or shell pavements, the WRS has a very good appearance in both outcrop and cores and is often used as the boundary of shallow-marine stratigraphic sequences. The WRS, therefore, represents an important lithological and paleo-environmental break, and its recognition is significant for reconstructing stratigraphic architectures and the history of relative sea-level change, as well as for reservoir characterization . Several controlling factors govern the development of the WRS and of the associated deposits; they include the accommodation to sedimentation (A/S) ratio, environmental energy, topographic gradient, roughness and lithology of the substrate. Relatively low rates of relative sea-level rise and sediment supply, high wave energy, steep topographies and easily erodible substrates favor the development of the WRS. These factors interact, leading to a high variability in the amount of erosion, shape, length along depositional dip and deposits associated with these surfaces. WRSs may be classified based on either underlying or overlying deposits, or a combination of both. A classification based on the deposits that underlie the WRS helps to determine the location of the studied outcrop along depositional dip, whereas a classification based on the deposits that overlie the WRS afford insights into the physical conditions that accompanied its formation. However, the best description of the WRS in terms of location of a considered outcrop, physical conditions under which the WRS developed and their lateral variability, type of substrate, as well as its practical significance for reservoir modeling is achieved with a combination of the two criteria. ]"

Foundations of chemical sorption, with focus on amine-based solvents. Foundations of physical sorption and advantages/disadvantages of current absorbents. Acid gas removal processes at industrial scale. , As global energy demand keeps rising, natural gas is meant to be the main protagonist of the clean energy transition, with increasingly importance in power generation and production of chemicals. However, the presence of contaminants in the raw gas, such as H 2 S and CO 2 , is the cause of several operational and technical issues ranging from equipment corrosion, fouling, catalyst deactivation , and environmental pollution . Therefore, it is necessary to remove contaminants from these gaseous mixtures for their efficient and safe use in multiple applications. The objective of this review is to explore different aspects of the acid gas removal (AGR) processes and technologies. The design of AGR unit and the main parameters affecting the process have been discussed. In the first part, the chemical absorption processes are summarised, including the chemical mechanisms involved and a screening of the main amine-based solvents currently used in such processes. In the second part, the physical absorption processes are presented, with properties, advantages and disadvantages of the typical absorbents. The comparison of various solvents, towards H 2 S and CO 2 removal techniques, has been discussed and supported by simulation and experimental studies. Industrial applications of AGR processes have been included in the discussion. Finally, the future directions of research to improve the removal processes and materials have been indicated. ]"

Due to technological challenges of sampling and observation at such extreme depths, these trenches are one of the least exploited habitats on our planet. Recent findings show high sedimentation rates , high biomass, intense microbial activity and chemosynthetic communities in hadal trenches, suggesting that they may play a more important role in global ocean biogeochemical cycles than previously recognized. Here we review the hadal biogeochemistry in four aspects: food supply and its effect on hadal life; hadal carbon cycle ; microbial-mediated stable carbon isotope fractionation in biosynthesis of lipids under high hydrostatic pressures ; and pollution in the hadal trenches. Our current knowledge of hadal biogeochemistry is rudimentary and many fundamental questions remain to be answered. However, with the rapid development of the full-ocean-depth exploration and sampling technologies, it is very likely hadal scientists will make significant breakthroughs in hadal biogeochemistry research in the coming decades. ]"

The Lopingian coal-bearing strata can be subdivided into seventeen 4th-order sequences and three 3rd-order composite sequences representing 6.76 Myr. Paleogeographic reconstructions of the WYCB demonstrate the existence of N-S trending terrestrial, transitional and marine facies belts distributed west to east away from the central ELIP. Geomorphological analysis indicates that the western boundary of the source area coincided with the major axis of the uplifted central ELIP. Based on sediment flux estimates and modeling (BQART model), relief of the central ELIP increased from near sea-level in the earliest Late Permian and reached equilibrium at about 200 m in the latest Permian . Sediment volume backfilling analysis indicates that total tectonic uplift of the central ELIP in the Late Permian was more than 500 m. Evolution of the coupled central ELIP and WYCB can be subdivided into three stages, pre-eruptive uplift stage, pre- and syn-eruptive subsidence stage, and syn- and post-eruptive uplift stage. Post-eruptive basin filling was controlled by sediment supply that was related to tectonic uplift, drainage topography and climate change, and basin accommodation that was related to sea-level fluctuations and plume-induced syn-sedimentary tectonics. ]"

However, the production of cement, key ingredient of concrete, releases roughly a tonne of CO 2 into the environment with each tonne of cement production. The environmental concerns and sustainability issues associated with cement and concrete necessitate alternative and better approach in the construction. Nature, on the other hand, has a plethora of examples of sustainable habitats such as coral reefs, silk webs and ant hills. Recent advances in biotechnology have great potential of emulating nature’s way of building in modern days infrastructures at a scale that would sustain increasing population. Further, many of the biological materials of nature, be it ceramics or polymeric composites formed in the process of biomineralization , provides basis for sustainable construction. This paper elaborates nature’s way of construction based on biomineralization and discusses the progress of different biological pathways for sustainable construction.

The sand-water continuum plays an important role in beach microbial contamination. Climate change may alter contaminant dynamics in sand, affecting public health. Hydrodynamic modeling can characterize microbial dynamics in sand and water. Beach management policy lags behind research into sand as a contamination source. , Although infectious disease risk from recreational exposure to waterborne pathogens has been an active area of research for decades, beach sand is a relatively unexplored habitat for the persistence of pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Beach sand, biofilms, and water all present unique advantages and challenges to pathogen introduction, growth, and persistence. These dynamics are further complicated by continuous exchange between sand and water habitats. Models of FIB and pathogen fate and transport at beaches can help predict the risk of infectious disease from beach use, but knowledge gaps with respect to decay and growth rates of pathogens in beach habitats impede robust modeling. Climatic variability adds further complexity to predictive modeling because extreme weather events, warming water, and sea level change may increase human exposure to waterborne pathogens and alter relationships between FIB and pathogens. In addition, population growth and urbanization will exacerbate contamination events and increase the potential for human exposure. The cumulative effects of anthropogenic changes will alter microbial population dynamics in beach habitats and the assumptions and relationships used in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and process-based models. Here, we review our current understanding of microbial populations and transport dynamics across the sand-water continuum at beaches, how these dynamics can be modeled, and how global change factors (e.g., climate and land use) should be integrated into more accurate beachscape-based models. ]"

There is a lack of consensus on what resilience means and how it can be measured as each stakeholder potentially brings a different perspective to understanding community disaster resilience. The paper will identify the key features and characteristics of Community Disaster Resilience (CDR) frameworks from the literature to develop a resilience framework that can be adapted and customised according to stakeholder needs. The paper used a 5-step process to develop an adaptable CDR framework. First, a review of 36 resilience frameworks was conducted to identify key features and characteristics of resilience frameworks. In Steps 2 and 3, a matrix of indicators and measures was populated by resilience dimensions covered in the current CDR literature reviewed. Subsequently, the indicators were sorted for similarities and duplicates were removed. Finally, they were clustered by six critical resilience dimensions (i.e. Physical, Health, Economic, Environmental, Social and Governance) into a library of 86 resilience indicators (composed of 360 measures) that can be used to operationalise a CDR framework according to the needs of the stakeholders. The review indicated that majority of the articles selected use objective approaches to measure resilience showing a gap for more frameworks using subjective, or participatory, approaches to measuring community resilience . An adaptable CDR framework may make resilience assessment more grounded in local stakeholder perspectives and lead to a better understanding of community resilience. ]"

Presents sources and types of data used to map groundwater potential. Highlight the research models and analyze its characteristics. Presents methods to determine the accuracy of the models. , This paper aims to review parameters, model techniques, validation methods in groundwater potential field. According to statistics, there are three major model groups used to establish groundwater potential maps. The first model group is a statistic group, including multi-criteria decision making/analytic hierarchy process, frequency ratio, evidence belief function, and weights of evidence. The second model group includes machine learning models, such as random forest, logistic regression, boosted regression tree, and support vector machine. The final group is the hybrid/ensemble models. In groundwater potential mapping studies, 41 thematic layers affect the potential of groundwater. However, hydrological researchers have frequently used eight factors in groundwater potential studies: geology, slope, land use, soil type, drainage density, lineament density, altitude, rainfall. Most previous studies on groundwater potential have used a combination of geographic information system, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques to design the groundwater potential in regions of interest. Data sources are commonly applied to groundwater potential mapping, including satellite, borehole, and geophysical data. The accuracy of groundwater potential maps produced by common machine learning models ranges from 50.0% to 90.1%, while that produced by common statistical models ranges between 59.0% and 90.3%. Interestingly, hybrid/ensemble models’ accuracy interval ranges from 71.0% to 92.0%. Therefore, the review suggests that statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques should be combined, and thematic layers should be increasingly used in mapping groundwater potential maps to achieve high efficiency. ]"

993,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661104000692,[ The role of seawater constituents in light backscattering in the ocean ],"[ The significance of light backscattering in the ocean is wide ranging, especially in optical remote sensing. However, the complexity of natural seawater as an optical medium often obscures the measured optical signals to the point that our present-day interpretation and detailed understanding of major sources of backscattering and its variability in the ocean are uncertain and controversial. Here we review the roles played by various seawater constituents in light backscattering and we address a question of ‘missing’ backscattering. Historically, this question has resulted from a hypothesis that under non-bloom conditions in the open ocean, phytoplankton make a significantly smaller contribution to the particulate backscattering coefficient than to the particulate (total) scattering coefficient. By discussing the backscattering properties and potential contributions of the various water constituents (colloids, bacteria, phytoplankton, biogenic detritus, minerogenic particles, bubbles), we show that due to substantial variability in water composition, different types of constituents can explain the ’missing’ backscattering. Under typical non-bloom conditions in the open ocean, the small-sized non-living particles appear to be the most important because of their high abundance relative to other particle types. These particles are believed to be primarily of organic origin but an important role of minerogenic particles cannot be excluded. Still, in the very clear ocean water the backscattering by water molecules themselves can contribute as much as 80% to the total backscattering coefficient in the blue spectral region. The general scenario of the dominance of molecules and small-sized particles can, however, be readily perturbed due to changes in local conditions. For example, bubbles entrained by breaking waves can intermittently dominate the backscattering at shallow depths below the sea surface, the calcifying phytoplankton (coccolithophores) producing calcite scales of high refractive index can dominate if present in sufficient concentration, and other plankton species can dominate during blooms. The role of phytoplankton could be generally greater than commonly assumed given the fact that real cells backscatter more light than predicted from homogeneous sphere models. In addition, high refractive index mineral particles can dominate in many coastal areas, and perhaps also in some open ocean areas during events of atmospheric dust deposition. It is likely that the different scenarios are quite widespread and frequent. Further improvements in quantitative understanding of the variability in light backscattering and its sources require an increased effort in basic research to better characterize the optical properties of the various seawater constituents and the variability in the detailed composition of seawater. Seawater is a complex optical medium containing a great variety of particle types and soluble species that vary in concentration and composition with time and location in the ocean, so ocean optics science must progress beyond the traditional overly simplified description, which has been based only on a few constituent categories defined broadly as molecular water, suspended particles (phytoplankton and non-algal particles), and dissolved organic matter. ]"

In a changing climate, some meteorological drivers are expected to become more extreme with, for example, more prolonged droughts or more frequent flooding. Such environmental changes will potentially have significant consequences for the human populations and ecosystems that are dependent on riverscapes, but our understanding of fluvial system response to external drivers remains incomplete. As a consequence, many of the predictions of the effects of climate change have a large uncertainty that hampers effective management of fluvial environments . Amongst the array of methodological approaches available to scientists and engineers charged with improving that understanding, is physical modelling. Here, we review the role of physical modelling for understanding both biotic and abiotic processes and their interactions in fluvial systems. The approaches currently employed for scaling and representing fluvial processes in physical models are explored, from 1:1 experiments that reproduce processes at real-time or time scales of 10 −1 -10 0 years, to analogue models that compress spatial scales to simulate processes over time scales exceeding 10 2 –10 3 years. An important gap in existing capabilities identified in this study is the representation of fluvial systems over time scales relevant for managing the immediate impacts of global climatic change; 10 1 – 10 2 years, the representation of variable forcing (e.g. storms), and the representation of biological processes. Research to fill this knowledge gap is proposed, including examples of how the time scale of study in directly scaled models could be extended and the time scale of landscape models could be compressed in the future, through the use of lightweight sediments, and innovative approaches for representing vegetation and biostabilisation in fluvial environments at condensed time scales, such as small-scale vegetation, plastic plants and polymers. It is argued that by improving physical modelling capabilities and coupling physical and numerical models, it should be possible to improve understanding of the complex interactions and processes induced by variable forcing within fluvial systems over a broader range of time scales. This will enable policymakers and environmental managers to help reduce and mitigate the risks associated with the impacts of climate change in rivers. ]"

Many reviews have focused on the techno-economic and environmental and ecological issues of the desalination technologies and emphasized the feasibility of desalination industry as an alternative to meet the water demands in many water scarce regions. Despite these efforts, many perceptions about desalination processes hinder their applications for potential water supplies. This article has two specific aims: 1) provide an overview of the desalination trends around the world and discuss the sustainability components of desalination processes in comparison with other water supply alternatives; and 2) discuss case studies for desalination, and drivers and factors that influence sustainable desalination and other alternative water sources for desalination to increase our current understanding on the sensitive and futuristic issues of water supply and resource management options for drought facing regions. Although some of the facts and recent developments discussed here show that desalination can be affordable and potentially sustainable, contributions that meaningfully address socio-economic and ecological and environmental issues of desalination processes are urgently required in this critical era of severe water stress for the present context and the future development of desalination technologies. ]"

The particulates and sediments bound within algal turfs can influence a multitude of functions within these ecosystems. Despite the global abundance and importance of algal turfs, comparison of algal turf-bound sediments is problematic due to a lack of standardisation across collection methods.

We review the purposes of these methods (e.g. quantification of standing stock versus net accumulation) and how methods can vary depending on the research question or monitoring protocol. By providing these details in a readily accessible format we hope to encourage a standardised set of approaches for marine benthic ecologists , geologists and managers, that facilitates further quantification and global comparisons of algal turf sediments. ]"

The basin depicts large-scale block fault of distinct graben structural topography. Observed faults in the basin can instigate or accelerate crustal deformation . The pattern of growth structure and imbricate thrusting indicate its complexity. , Remotely acquired gravity data from satellite gravimetry is integrated into the study to investigate crustal deformation in the Niger Delta Basin. The Niger Delta Basin is a well-documented example of a passive margin delta that has gravitationally deformed. The gravity-driven deformation has not been fully understood, and new trends may be emerging. In this study, we assess and delineate structural deformation and sediment accumulation of the Agbada and Akata stratigraphic sequences within the basin's prograding clastic wedge. This was done through the integration of data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, Landsat 8 satellite imagery, and the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) World 3D-30 m (AW3D) DEM. The methodology workflow incorporated gravity modelling from GRACE data, lineament extraction from Landsat imagery, and drainage network analysis from the AW3D DEM. The Niger Delta Basin as seen on the gravity models depicts large-scale block faults with a well-defined graben structural topography. This eventually shows that the basin is dominated by growth faulting with differential subsidence. The predominant directions of the mapped lineaments are in the N-S and W-E directions. With over 18,500 lineaments, the W-E direction is marginally the dominant direction of the two predominant directions. Many linear structures such as shear zones and fractures which have different orientations and directions characterise the study area. Also present are the minor N-S fractures which are attributed to brittle deformation and sets of NE-SW and NW-SE trends, produced by transcurrent movements as the structural framework of the Nigerian basement complex are dominated by the NE-SW lineaments. However, the complexity in the structural geometry and thrusting sequences in the Niger Delta shows the patterns of growth structure and imbricate thrusting. The structural pattern also exhibits outward radial gravity spreading of dip-orientated, extensional structures that include delta slope radial grabens and tear faults. Radial spreading has likely increased the segmentation of Niger Delta regional depo-belts in the N-S direction. It is observed that most of the structural deformations in the basin are syn-formational, evolving at the same time as sediment deposition. ]"
