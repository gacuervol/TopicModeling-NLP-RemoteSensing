The covered topics include the research advances on estuarine dynamics , wave climate, and coastline evolution in the region. This review aims to offer an updated baseline on the topics and sites that have been more explored by coastal scientists and those who need more efforts in short- to mid-term.

Seabirds greatly influence ecological processes and functioning of recipient systems. Seabird functions influence the provision of many ecosystem services. More studies are needed to improve the knowledge in this field. , Seabirds are vital, but overlooked, components of coastal marine ecosystems and may connect the marine and terrestrial environment at a global scale, significantly contributing to inter-habitat connectivity and the provision of multiple ecosystem services. Although the ecological and functional role of birds in terrestrial areas , islands in particular, has been deeply studied since the last century, the same does not hold true for coastal marine areas. Given the importance of coastal areas for seabirds worldwide and, at the same time, the high vulnerability of both, looking into the role of seabirds in influencing the ecosystem functioning in coastal areas is needed nowadays. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding the role of seabirds on coastal ecological processes giving particular emphasis on the linkage between the seabird functions that are crucial in influencing the ecological processes and the provision of ecosystem services, and disservices, for the human well-being. Seabirds can contribute to shaping coastal ecological processes and services in a multitude of ways, among which directly influencing trophic status , environmental contamination, biodiversity and food webs through trophic (bottom-up or top-down) and non-trophic processes.

Various indicators are used to express potential storm impact and describe the associated hazards. The most commonly used indicators include either forcing parameters (e.g. wave height, sea level) or coastal morphologies (e.g. dune height or berm width). Whereas they do not represent the processes associated with storm induced hazards in coastal areas. Alternatively, a hazard could be better characterised if process-based indicators are used instead. Process-based indicators express the result of the forcing mechanisms acting over the coastal morphology and reflect both hydrodynamic and morphological characteristics. This work discusses and synthesizes the most relevant process-based indicators for sandy shores subject to overwash , erosion and inundation promoted by storms. Those include: overwash depth, potential and extent; shoreline , berm or dune retreat; vertical erosion; and inundation depth and extent. The selection of a reduced set of process-based indicators to identify coastal hazards induced by storms in sandy coasts will facilitate comparison of different coastal behaviours for distinct storm return periods, and help to optimise coastal management plans, thereby contributing to the reduction of coastal risks. ]\n","3\n","iteracion 4\n","[ Historical antecedents and local governance in the process of public policies building for coastal zone of Brazil ]\n","4\n","[ Brazil has a very big coastal zone of approximately 514.000 km 2 that embraces 397 municipalities in 17 coastal states.

Coastal plains such as the one in the southern part of Samborombón Bay have a tidal morphology consisting of fine sediment deposits, tidal channels, and aeolian sand sheets, each of them playing a hydrological role. In this paper, we describe the hydrological processes in the Samborombón Bay coastal plain using hydrochemical and isotopical data to provide evidence of salinization processes. Specific ionic relationships for surface and ground water samples from each formation are differ from those of sea water. Isotopic data also reveal infrequent participation of sea water in the coastal area water samples, showing an evaporation trend in both surface and ground water. We conclude that salinization has its origin in the occurrence of gypsum and halite, as well as other chlorides, from the coastal plain deposits. Rainfall recharge, continental water inputs, evaporation and long residence times define the hydrochemical and isotopical features of ground water, which shows no signs of present sea water contribution. Sand sheets constitute local aquifers with lower salinity content. Continental surface waters, as well as rainfall drainage via tidal channels, have a dominant effect on surface water hydrochemistry notwithstanding tidal oscillations. Exploitation of water resources is thus limited to regionally extended aeolian sand sheet formations and to surface waters, specifically those related to contributions of freshwater discharge from inland areas. ]\n","5\n","iteracion 6\n","[ Coastal barriers — Nomenclature, processes, and classification issues ]\n","6\n","[ The designation “coastal barrier”, related terms and their varied interpretations, and critical concepts in coastal plain and nearshore geology, underwent numerous reincarnations over the years. This designation was first applied to shore-parallel sand and gravel-built ocean-front islands and spits that separate open marine environments from paralic inshore environments that they shelter. A more recently recognized third category includes mainland strandplain, chenier, and dunefield barriers, either as original components of mainland coasts or subsequently welded to the coastal plain. A parallel but closely related terminology, developed mostly in Australia and Brazil, identifies several specific process categories recognizable in the three basic barrier groups. In the absence of lagoons and tidal wetlands, shore ridges that front and are contiguous with the mainland coastal plain have been mistakenly assigned to the barrier island category. Greatly diminished wave energy and consequently minor littoral drift volumes account for the relative rarity and much smaller dimensions of prograded landforms in estuarine islands and bay shore beaches in paralic-inshore basins. Due to wave and related littoral drift processes, however diminished in comparison with open marine shores, morphological similarities between aggraded landforms of open marine through estuarine settings are to be expected. However, the multitude of proposed “fetch-limited”, diminished wave energy estuarine islands, characterized by diminutive narrow beaches, sand spits, even occasional small dunes, and miniature strandplains, lack the essential functional attributes intrinsic to true barrier islands. While barrier islands may form even on relatively low wave energy and/or sediment-deficient marine shores, the term is inappropriate for islands located in low-energy paralic basins, including estuaries, or in coastal plains where frontal shore ridges are not backed by lagoons. Landforms erroneously ascribed in a variety of facies settings as barrier islands or islands frequently are mainland-attached beach ridge plains or beach-fringed marshlands instead. Narrow marshland beaches and mainland strandplain barriers are segmented into short islands by intervening narrow tidal creeks, fluvial distributary channels, or storm cuts that separate them. Improved fundamental and functional definitions of barrier islands, their comparison with the many genetic categories of islands and mainland shore beaches found in estuarine basins and wetlands should lead to a better understanding of paralic island evolution processes on the global scale. ]\n","6\n","iteracion 7\n","[ Sources, behaviors, transformations, and environmental risks of organophosphate esters in the coastal environment: A review ]\n","7\n","[ Highlights The coastal environment is an important sink of organophosphate esters (OPEs).

The bioaccumulation of OPEs has been observed in coastal biota. OPEs can be distributed remotely through atmospheric and ocean transports. , The rapid growth in the global production of organophosphate esters (OPEs) has resulted in their high environmental concentrations. The low removal rate of OPEs makes the effluents of wastewater treatment plants be one of the major sources of OPEs. Due to relatively high solubility and mobility, OPEs can be carried to the coastal environment through river discharge and atmospheric deposition . Therefore, the coastal environment can be an important OPE sink. Previous studies have shown that OPEs were widely detected in coastal atmospheres, water, sediments, and even aquatic organisms. OPEs can undergo various environmental processes in the coastal environment, including adsorption/desorption, air–water exchange, and degradation. In addition, bioaccumulation of OPEs was observed in coastal biota but current concentrations would not cause significant ecological risks. More efforts are required to understand the environmental behaviors of OPEs and address resultant environmental and health risks, especially in the complicated environment. ]\n","7\n","iteracion 8\n","[ Measuring and understanding sustainability-enhancing processes in tropical coastal and marine social–ecological systems ]\n","8\n","[ Tropical coastal and marine social–ecological systems (CM-SES) are diverse, complex and dynamic, facing special challenges as hotspots of biodiversity and centres of population growth.

In the coastal region, complex sources invariably influence the groundwater flow and its quality. This warrants multicriteria evaluation techniques consequent to which Geographical Information System (GIS) based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used for the selection of groundwater sampling units in an effort to assess the impact of shrimp farming. Thematic maps of eight base layers viz. distance from the aquaculture ponds, drainage pattern in the study area, lineament, soil texture, slope, landuse/landcover, geomorphology and lithology were prepared using ARCGIS 10 as these were the main factors that could impact groundwater quality. Information on the relative importance of the evaluation criteria was obtained by assigning weights to each criterion defined by pairwise comparison for all the above eight factors. Pairwise comparison revealed that the consistency ratio was less than the threshold value (0.1) indicating perfection in comparison of each evaluation criterion. Eight criteria of distance, seven criteria of drainage, three criteria of lineament, seven criteria of soil, eight criteria of landuse, three criteria of slope, seven criteria of geomorphology and five criteria of geology were computed and combined to develop a priority classification map related to the influence of brackish water aquaculture on the salinisation of the groundwater in an effort to precisely assess the impact. On analysis, 29 sampling well locations were identified with three priority classes viz., (i) high priority (10), (ii) moderate priority (13) and (iii) low priority (6). Groundwater samples from all these sampling units were collected bimonthly starting from October 2011 till June 2013 and analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and chloride (Cl). Results revealed no significant relationship of groundwater quality as per the priority classification. Hierarchical cluster analysis clearly elucidated the variation of different water quality parameters being independent of the location of aqua farms indicating multiple sources for variation. From the spatial distribution map, it could be concluded that groundwater quality is independent of shrimp farming. ]\n","9\n","iteracion 10\n","[ Barriers and enablers for upscaling coastal restoration ]\n","10\n","[ Coastal restoration is often distrusted and, at best, implemented at small scales, which hampers its potential for coastal adaptation.

The paper posits that there is enough knowledge, technology, financial and governance capabilities for increasing the pace and scale of restoration, before the onset of irreversible coastal degradation. We propose a systemic restoration, which integrates Nature based Solutions (NbS) building blocks, to provide climate-resilient ecosystem services and improved biodiversity to curb coastal degradation.

Hydrodynamic studies form the basis for many oceanographic subjects, whether sediment transport, morphology, water quality, ecological and climate changes are being investigated. Hydrodynamic modelling of oceans and coastal seas has become a fundamental tool for describing the dynamics of marine environments, revealing the human impact on the sea and promoting sustainable development of marine resources. By complementing - through data assimilation - more and more diffuse and integrated global and regional observing systems (composed of coastal gauges, moorings, buoys, satellites, drifters), hydrodynamic models provide a deterministic 4D view of the ocean state. In this context, the semi-enclosed Adriatic Sea represents a natural long-standing laboratory for hydrodynamic modelling. The peculiar historical, morphological and oceanographic characteristics of this basin and its complex coastline stimulated over decades the development and application of several ocean and coastal models. In this work, we review different aspects of hydrodynamic modelling covered by the literature, highlighting the wide variety of model applications carried out in the Adriatic Sea which could serve as examples for semi-enclosed, marginal and coastal seas worldwide. Within the scope of the review, we find that although significant progress has been made over the last few decades, most of the modelling studies underrate the importance of a detailed representation of the land-coastal-sea fluxes. We list a set of recommendations that can be used as guidelines for model implementation to broaden the applicability of hydrodynamic models in future studies.

This review compares nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles in temperate and tropical coastal waters. We review the literature to identify major similarities and differences between these two regions, specifically with regards to the impact of environmental factors (temperature, sunlight), riverine inputs, groundwater, lateral fluxes, atmospheric deposition , nitrogen fixation , organic nutrient cycling, primary production, respiration, sedimentary burial, denitrification and anammox. Overall, there are some similarities but also key differences in nutrient cycling, with differences relating mainly to temperature, sunlight, and precipitation amounts and patterns. We conclude that due to the differences in biogeochemical processes, we cannot directly apply cause and effect relationships and models from temperate systems in tropical coastal waters. Our review also highlights the considerable gaps in knowledge of the biogeochemical processes of tropical coastal waters compared with temperate systems. Given the ecological and societal importance of tropical coastal waters, we hope that highlighting the differences and similarities to temperate systems as well as the existing gaps, will inspire further studies on their biogeochemical processes. Such knowledge will be essential to better understand and forecast impacts on tropical coastal nutrient cycling at local, regional, and global scales. ]\n","12\n","iteracion 13\n","[ Strategies of dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction for coastal zone environmental pollutant determination ]\n","13\n","[ Highlights DLLME advances for coastal zone environmental pollutant determination are reviewed.

These pollutants usually have characteristics of low residues, complicated matrices, easy accumulation and so on, causing difficulty to detect coastal pollutants quickly and sensitively. It is imperative to perform effective sample preparation prior to instrumental analysis. Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) has attracted significant research interest for sample preparation, owing to its high enrichment ability, low reagent/sample consumption, and wide analyte/matrix applicability, as well as robustness, simplicity, rapidity and inexpensiveness.

Grey infrastructure increasingly incorporates ecological processes at varying scales. Dikes, reefs, saltmarshes, sand nourishment and dunes span a wide segment of spectrum. Internal resilience clarifies how infrastructure can enhance value for people. , In the face of uncertainties around coastal management and climate change, coastal engineering interventions need to be able to adapt to changing conditions. Nature-based solutions and other non-traditional, integrated interventions are gaining traction. However, system-based views are not yet embedded into coastal management strategies. Moreover, the differences in coastal interventions, ranging from hard (‘grey’) to nature-based (‘green’) infrastructure remain understudied. In coastal management it is therefore challenging to work with the grey-green spectrum of interventions with clarity and focus, and to produce results that can be evaluated. The objective of this paper was to examine whether there is a common understanding of: the characteristics and differences between grey and green infrastructure, where interventions sit on this spectrum, and the resilience of grey versus green infrastructure. We conducted an integrative literature review of the grey-green spectrum of coastal infrastructure. We examined 105 coastal protection case studies and expanded the double-insurance framework to ensure an integrative approach, looking at both external and internal factors of resilience. Our review showed that external factors are typically used to characterise the grey-green spectrum. However, although useful, they do not facilitate a holistic comparison of alternative interventions. The additional consideration of internal factors (response diversity, multifunctionality , modularity and adaptive, participatory governance) bridges this gap. The review showed that dikes, reefs, saltmarshes, sand nourishment and dunes span a wider segment of the grey-green spectrum than they are generally categorised in. Furthermore, resilient solutions for adaptation are unlikely to be exclusively engineered or natural, but tend to be a mix of the two at different spatial scales (micro, meso, macro and mega). Our review therefore suggests that coastal planners benefit from a more diverse range of options when they consider the incorporation of grey and green interventions in the context of each spatial scale. We propose that internal resilience should be accounted for when infrastructure options are comparatively evaluated. This consideration brings attention to the ways in which the grey-hybrid-green spectrum of infrastructure enhances value for people. ]\n","15\n","iteracion 16\n","[ Harbor and coastal structures: A review of mechanical fatigue under random wave loading ]\n","16\n","[ Harbor and coastal structures are essential in maritime connections.

There has not yet been extensive research into how resilience is being defined in practice and how these definitions can affect geographies of risk and resilience and contribute to varying ecological, social, cultural, political, and economic outcomes. In this paper, we analyzed how stakeholders engaged in natural resource management activities within the Laurentian Great Lakes coastal environment define resilience and discuss the implications for planning and policy making through a critical geography and critical space lens.

The Río de La Plata is the major export of suspended sediment in the region. The SSCare influenced by the ENSO cycles. The river discharge from Patos Lagoon and íde la Plata and Río de La Plata interact with the SSC on a seasonal up to interannual time scale of variability. The wind contribution on the SSC behaviour gains importance on the inner shelfon a synoptic time scale. , Global coastal zones are constantly changing due to the actions of various physical forces. Recent studies show that the supply of suspended sediment of continental origin plays an important role in these changes. Once in the coastal region, this sediment significantly influences the sedimentation process on the inner shelf. Thus, understanding the transport and destination of these suspended sediments is crucial to interpret the morphodynamic evolution of the seabed and biogeochemical processes in the ocean. The Southwest Atlantic Shelf is the largest continental shelf in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the most important in biological production, because of the great continental contribution exercised by both Río de la Plata and Patos Lagoon . Studies in the region showed that these effluents are significantly affected by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect, which can interfere with the availability of suspended material inserted into the coastal region. Despite the great efforts of several authors to understand these changes and their interactions with the environment, some questions remain unanswered. Thus, this work aims to fill this gap by answering questions related to the contribution of suspended sediment of continental origin and its behaviour on the Southwest Atlantic Inner Shelf. The behaviour of suspended sediment was investigated in two distinct periods using the hydro-morphodynamic model TELEMAC-3D: one representing normal years, that is, without the effect of ENSO (2005–2006) and the other experiencing the effect of ENSO (2008–2009).The model was calibrated and validated using field data for both studied periods. R esults were based on statistical analysis, such as wavelet and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, in addition to time series analysis. Results showed that the Southwest Atlantic Inner Shelf is mainly influenced by the fluvial discharge of Río de la Plata and Patos Lagoon, and by the local wind. Río de la Plata is the largest exporter of suspended sediment in the region, with an approximate rate of 1.2 × 10 8 tons.year -1 in neutral (normal) years and 3.0 × 10 8 tons.year -1 in years under the influence of ENSO. The Patos Lagoon, on the other hand, exports approximately 1.25 × 10 7 tons.year -1 in the period without the ENSO effect and 1.35 × 10 7 tons.year -1 in the period influenced by ENSO. Results also showed that the fluvial discharge interacts with the suspended sediment in seasonal to interannual scales, while the wind contributes to the concentration of suspended sediment on synoptic scales. Still on the wind regime, results show that the local wind regime gains importance particularly when the suspended sediment reaches the coastal region. ]\n","18\n","iteracion 19\n","[ Coastal transitions: Small-scale fisheries, livelihoods, and maritime zone developments in Southeast Asia ]\n","19\n","[ Highlights Critically reviews maritime zone developments in Southeast Asia.

This study provided a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of MODIS R_land products against a field optical dataset containing 4143 reflectance spectra, 2320 chlorophyll-a (Chl a ) samples, and 1467 suspended particulate matter (SPM) samples across global nearshore coastal and inland waters . The results showed that R_land significantly overestimated remote sensing reflectance, particularly in the bands of 469 nm and 859 nm. The noticeable negative values and patchiness were found in the R_land imagery, and existing algorithms did not estimate satisfactory Chl a and SPM from R_land across the global inland and coastal waters. Furthermore, we tested popular machine-learning approaches, such as random forest (RF), support vector machine , XGBoost, and deep neural networks, to examine the potential of the R_land product in estimating SPM and Chl a . Machine learning models were found to outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms for SPM retrievals from R_land. Specifically, RF and XGBoost showed the good performance with mean absolute errors of ~25.0% and mean absolute percentage error of ~23% for a broad SPM range of 10–500 mg L −1 . Yet, machine learning models cannot retrieve reliable Chl a from R_land with approximately 55% uncertainty due to the limited spectral information and uncertainty of R_land products. This implicated that R_land might be able to quantify the parameters that are closely related to SPM (e.g., water clarity and extinction coefficients) in most waters; however, it is challenging to quantify pigments like Chl a in waters from R_land. We conclude that R_land might not be an optimal data source for monitoring inland and coastal waters, despite the ease of using this product and its higher spatial resolution than the MODIS ocean bands. ]\n","20\n","iteracion 21\n","[ Implications of polymodal distributions in the grain size parameters of coastal dune sands (Oaxaca, Mexico) ]\n","21\n","[ Highlights Oaxaca's coastal dunes in Mexico develop under complex geological and physical conditions. The Weibull analysis supports the polymodal distributions in the Oaxaca's coastal dune sands. Dune morphology seems not to control the diversity in grain sizes of the coastal dune sands. , This study elucidates the geological and physical factors that produce polymodal grain size distributions in two dunes systems in southeastern Oaxaca, Mexico. The dune systems are characterized by (1) small embryo vegetated, transverse and undeveloped dunes; and (2) tall types identified as barchanoid, parabolic, climbing and falling dunes. We performed a best-fit statistical Weibull distribution model with data obtained by laser granulometry to determine the polymodal trends of the coastal dune sands distribution. Polymodal distributions in small dunes arise from coarse and fine-grained sands mainly derived from the erosion of alluvial deposits composed of granitic and metasedimentary rock fragments (e.g., schists , orthogneiss and paragneiss). The medium- to fine-grained sands result from wind deflation, producing a heavy mineral lag. Conversely, the polymodal grain size distributions in the tall dunes are mainly derived from the physical weathering of granites , andesitic-tuff-lava flow marine sandstones (ATLMS), alluvial deposits, and metasedimentary rock fragments (e.g., schists, orthogneiss and paragneiss) due to the frequent storms and intense winds. We constructed binary plots of grain size parameters to compare the dune sand systems in Oaxaca with some others in Mexico. Based on the sedimentary results and the Weibull distributions, we conclude that the grain sizes of the coastal dune sands from Oaxaca, Mexico, are controlled by the sand composition, wind patterns, hydrodynamic conditions, weathering effects, and physical characteristics, regardless of the dune geomorphology. Evidence of multicycle aeolian transport of sand particles in the Oaxaca coastal dunes is supported by the compositional framework of the sands and the roundness of sand grains. ]\n","21\n","iteracion 22\n","[ Modelling the Dynamic Effect of Environmental Pollution on Coastal Tourism ]\n","22\n","[ The sustainability and development of coastal tourism is a subject of serious debate and discussions among researchers.

The result of the analysis showed that the pollution/contamination free equilibrium of the model is feasible if the pollution/contamination threshold number C p C p , which represents the average number of secondary pollution produced in the area is less than unity i.e C p &lt; 1 C p &lt; 1 otherwise, the only feasible equilibrium is the visitors-resources-pollution/contamination when C p &gt; 1 C p &gt; 1 .

It is therefore recommended that restrictions should be put in place to make sure carrying capacity of a tourist attraction is not exceeded, and the neatness of the environment should be ensured. More so, authorities should ensure high level of sanitation before, during and after every tourist activities around the coastal tourism facilities to ensure sustainability with the aim of meeting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targeted for 2030. ]\n","22\n","iteracion 23\n","[ The coastal tourism industry in the Mediterranean: A critical review of the socio-economic and environmental pressures &amp; impacts ]\n","23\n","[ Highlights Tourism is a vital economic source in the Mediterranean countries.

The sun and beach tourists are of major social and economic importance for almost all Mediterranean countries. However, this industry's extensive and uncontrolled growth may negatively impact these fragile natural coastline areas. In the present study, we review and analyse the driver's forces, pressures, and impacts of the tourism sector development in the Mediterranean countries' environment and economy by using the D (Driver) P (Pressure) S (State) I (Impact) R (Responses) analytical framework. The analysis highlights the critical social and economic roles the coastal tourism industry plays while the steady and uncontrolled growth of this sector and related activities compromise these coastal countries' ecology and environmental quality. This requires the decision-makers and stakeholders' attention toward adopting new strategies and approaches toward greening the blue tourism industry to ensure sustainable economic, social and environmental growth of this industry.

An intersection of four themes characterize the oil-fisheries-livelihoods nexus. Small-scale fishing communities experience adverse impacts due to reduced access to ocean-based livelihoods. The compounding pressures include pollution, dwindling fish stock, and overall marginalization. Future research should focus on gender and cross-sectoral governance and collaboration. , A quarter of global oil production comes from offshore fields and about 60% of internationally-traded oil travels by tankers. The relationship between oil, fisheries, and coastal communities is documented primarily through case studies in individual jurisdictions and via the impacts of oil spills. Yet, the implications of oil development for fisheries and coastal communities are much broader. This study provides an extensive review of the effects of oil development in relation to four interconnected themes: 1) the environment, including marine habitats and fish; 2) small-scale fisheries and coastal community livelihoods; 3) coastal and ocean spaces, including disputes over territory and infrastructure; and 4) ocean and coastal governance processes. We map spatial overlaps between the oil sector and small-scale fisheries and point to the frequent displacement of fishers from fishing grounds due to increasing coastal traffic and infrastructure, and the catastrophic effects of oil spills on fisheries and coastal economies. Though the oil sector generally has negative impacts on fisheries livelihoods and coastal communities, these effects and their mechanisms vary across locations, ecosystems, species, and specific activities and groups. Overall, this narrative review provides a comprehensive account of the scholarship to date and points to key themes for future research, including intersections between offshore oil and gender, cross-sectoral governance, and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 14.

This review compared the PAHs pollution characteristics of different coastal areas, including industrial zones, commercial ports, touristic cities, aquacultural &amp; agricultural areas, oil &amp; gas exploitation areas and megacities. Currently there are various treatment methods to remediate soils and sediments contaminated with PAHs. However, it is necessary to provide a comprehensive overview of all the available remediation technologies up to date, so appropriate technologies can be selected to remediate PAHs pollution. In view of that, we analyzed the characteristics of the remediation mechanism, summarized the remediation methods for soil or sediments in coastal areas, which were physical repair, chemical oxidation, bioremediation and integrated approaches. Besides, this review also reported the development of new multi-functional green and sustainable systems, namely, micro-nano bubble (MNB), biochar, reversible surfactants and peracetic acid. While physical repair, expensive but efficient, was regarded as a suitable method for the PAHs remediation in coastal areas because of land shortage, integrated approaches would produce better results. The ultimate aim of the review was to ensure the successful restructuring of PAHs contaminated soil and sediments in coastal areas. Due to the environment heterogeneity, PAHs pollution in coastal areas remains as a daunting challenge. Therefore, new and suitable technologies are still needed to address the environmental issue. ]\n","25\n","iteracion 26\n","[ Impacts of coastal structures on hydro-morphodynamic patterns and guidelines towards sustainable coastal development: A case studies review ]\n","26\n","[ Highlights Port development leads to anthropogenic interventions for inlet stabilization.

Changes in these components, as a response to rapidly warming climate in the Arctic, are intensely expressed in the coastal zone. These areas receive increased terrestrial runoff while subject to a changing sea-ice and ocean environment. Proxies derived from marine sediment archives provide long-term data that extend beyond instrumental measurements. They are therefore fundamental in disentangling human-driven versus natural processes, changes and responses. This paper (1) provides an overview of current Arctic cryosphere change, (2) reviews state-of-the-art palaeoecological approaches, (3) identifies methodological and knowledge gaps, and (4) discusses the strengths and future potential of palaeoecology and palaeoceanography to respond to societally-relevant coastal marine ecosystem challenges.

The tourism should be included in monitoring due to its large floating population. , Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) are emerging pollutants detected in many locations of the world including Antarctica . The main objective of this review is to discuss the influence of the human population on the concentration, distribution and biological effects of PPCPs across the Antarctic coastal marine ecosystem . We carried out a review of the scientific articles published for PPCPs in Antarctic, supported by the information of the Antarctic stations reported by Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (CONMAP), Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty (ATS). In addition, spatial data regarding the Antarctic continent was obtained from Quantarctica. Antarctic concentrations of PPCPs were more reflective of the treatment system used by research stations as opposed to the infrastructure built or the annual occupancy by station. The main problem is that most of the research stations lack tertiary treatment , resulting in elevated concentrations of PPCPs in effluents. Furthermore, the geographic distribution of Antarctic field stations in coastal areas allows for the release of PPCPs, directly into the sea, a practice that remains in compliance with the current Protocol. After their release, PPCPs can become incorporated into sea ice, which can then act as a chemical reservoir. In addition, there is no clarity on the effects on the local biota. Finally, we recommend regulating the entry and use of PPCPs in Antarctica given the difficulties of operating, and in some cases the complete absence of appropriate treatment systems. Further studies are needed on the fate, transport and biological effects of PPCPs on the Antarctic biota. It is recommended that research efforts be carried out in areas inhabited by humans to generate mitigation measures relative to potential adverse impacts. Tourism should be also considered in further studies due the temporal release of PPCPs. ]\n","28\n","iteracion 29\n","[ Impacts of coastal realignment on biodiversity.

This intervention induces changes in biodiversity. A systematic review, including a meta-analysis, was carried out to assess the impact of coastal realignment on biodiversity. 4 476 references of published and gray literature were collected from two publication databases, Google Scholar and specialist websites. After a screening process, a database of 255 relevant articles corresponding to 866 studies (one taxon in one site) was constructed. Qualitative data were extracted in order to identify knowledge gaps and clusters. Focusing on the 190 studies with a Before-After-Reference-Intervention experimental design, the risk of bias in studies was assessed. Excluding studies with a high level of bias or with non-extractable data, quantitative data related to abundance and species richness were analyzed from 19 and 24 studies respectively. Study sites are mostly in the USA and the UK, but also in Canada and other European countries. Plants are the main group of taxa studied while mammals, amphibians and reptiles are rarely considered. Similarly, studies focus mainly on species richness and abundance but much less on structural and functional parameters. The species richness of invertebrates and the abundance of fishes and shorebirds seem to increase after realignment, whereas the species richness of plants decreases. No changes in the species richness of birds, fishes and macrocrustaceans, and in the abundance of birds, invertebrates, macrocrustaceans and plants, were found. More research on lesser studied taxa and parameters is encouraged to obtain a broad view on the subject and help with decision-making in coastal-realignment operations by providing them with comprehensive ecological arguments.

Coastal C sink is degrading, collaborative efforts are proposed for its restoration. , The global extent of coasts is huge and it has a massive impact on the planetary C balance. Coasts are again very heterogeneous with their soils and sediments possessing varying C storing capacity. In this review, we tried to capture such capacity of soils and sediments of coastal natural ecologies (like estuary , mangrove , mudflat, tidal marsh, seagrass , lagoon , continental shelf etc.) and croplands collectively in a mechanistic way. A detail discussion highlights very high C accrual in coastal soils and sediments due to terrigenous C deposition, tidal sedimentation and presence of fine clay particles. Very high biomass of coastal mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass beds also results huge C burial in soils and sediments (blue C). Further, salinity and waterlogging induced low microbial activities , high soil aggregation and occlusion of C within aggregates impart prolonged residence time to C in coastal soils. All these confirm coastal ecology as a global C hotspot.

A set of management actions, are proposed in order to preserve MCA. , During the last decades, the coastal areas of Morocco have witnessed an intense socioeconomic development associated with a continuous population growth and urban extension. This has led to an overexploitation of coastal aquifers leading to a degradation of their water quality. In order to obtain large scale overview on the quality status of Morocco's coastal aquifers (MCA) to assist national water managers to make informed decisions, a comprehensive scrutinization of the MCA against common indicators and using unified methods is essential. In this study, databases from thirteen MCA were analyzed, using multivariate statistical approaches and graphical methods in order to investigate the degree of mineralization in each aquifer and to identify the main salinization processes prevailing in groundwater. The results showed that the dominant groundwater types are Na–Cl, Ca–Mg–Cl, Ca–Mg–SO 4 , Ca–Mg–HCO 3 and Ca–HCO 3 –Cl. The Gibbs diagram and the seawater contribution (0–37%) indicate that the mineralization is mainly due to the seawater intrusion and water-rock interaction. The salinity degree diagram illustrates that almost all groundwater samples are located in the moderate to very saline zone, indicating that MCA are recharged by water from variable sources. The groundwater quality assessment shows a deterioration, particularly by seawater intrusion and significant nitrate pollution. The temporal evolution confirm that the MCA are influenced by seawater namely in the Atlantic part. The Wilcox and USSL diagram indicate that the majority of sampled water are unsuitable for irrigation uses. In addition, and by referring to the WHO and the Moroccan standards for water potability, large number of samples from the groundwaters of the MCA is not fully adequate for drinking purposes.

While the region is one of the best studied marine systems in the world, a historical perspective that connects social-ecological dynamics of change across California's diverse cultural periods is lacking. Historical ecology offers a lens through which researchers and managers can use historical information to not only better understand the complex dynamics that have driven ecosystem change in the past, but also inform crucial decisions around conservation and sustainable management of these systems into the future. Here we synthesize historical estimates of population abundance of eleven key species and habitats across coastal California as a foundation for understanding the potential for decline, recovery, or reorganization inherent in these ecosystems. This millennia-scale historical perspective reveals that humans have played a significant role in shaping California's marine ecosystem dynamics for far longer than is traditionally accounted for in many restoration and management contexts. Each individual cultural period reviewed here paints an increasingly complex story of social-ecological interactions and impacts, with each time period intricately tied to the trajectory of the last. As we consider management actions in an increasingly unpredictable future, information around how these systems have historically responded to new and growing pressures may prove invaluable to their future sustainability . While historical baselines may not provide a realistic, or even desirable, model for future sustainability, they may offer important insights into the social-ecological potential for change and recovery moving forward. ]\n","32\n","iteracion 33\n","[ Biogeochemical cycling of iron (hydr-)oxides and its impact on organic carbon turnover in coastal wetlands: A global synthesis and perspective ]\n","33\n","[ Coastal wetlands host large and dynamic reservoirs of organic carbon (C) and are also biogeochemical hotspots for a wide range of Fe (hydr-)oxides with different chemical reactivities, properties, and functions. The cycling of these iron (hydr-)oxides is closely coupled to that of organic C, which in turn strongly influences the magnitude and dynamics of organic C turnover in these ecosystems. This review synthesizes and summarizes current knowledge of distribution, turnover, and controls of Fe (hydr-)oxides, as well as their ecological roles and impacts on organic C turnover in coastal wetland ecosystems globally. Regional hydro-geochemical processes and anthropogenic activities in the uplands as well as soil texture exert a first-order control on the abundance and distribution of Fe (hydr-)oxides in coastal wetland soils , while the activities of plant roots and macro-organisms act as important biological drivers for the formation, transformation, and turnover of Fe (hydr-)oxides as well as associated organic C in both rhizosphere/burrows and bulk soils. The reported rates of dissimilatory Fe reduction (DFeR) are correlated with incubation temperature and the sizes of reactive Fe(III) phases. However, the contributions of DFeR to total anaerobic carbon oxidation were found to be correlated only with the size of reactive Fe(III) pools, meaning that all the identified processes contributing to the accumulation and formation of Fe hydroxides could increase the importance of the DFeR-dominated respiratory pathway and suppress sulfate reduction and methanogenesis . Additionally, Fe plaques dominated by amorphous Fe hydroxides are formed and cycled in close interaction with the activities of wetland plant roots, and likely provide several important ecological functions and contribute to maintaining high levels of plant productivity in coastal wetlands under different environmental stresses. The features and findings presented in this review not only contribute to an improved understanding of the biogeochemical cycle and ecological roles of Fe (hydr-)oxides in coastal wetlands, but also provide a basis for future studies on some highlighted key research areas. Such future studies will further increase our ability to understand and predict how the size, stability, and turnover of Fe (hydr-)oxides and organic C in coastal wetlands will respond to and affect global climate change. ]\n","33\n","iteracion 34\n","[ Scale dependency in quantifications of the avulsion frequency of coastal rivers ]\n","34\n","[ Highlights Avulsion histories of lowland rivers are quantified in terms of avulsion events, channel threads, and delta lobes. Relationships between avulsion-frequency proxies and associated spatial and temporal scales are assessed. Recommendations are made on how to compare the avulsion frequency of coastal-plain rivers. , Quantification of the frequency with which coastal-plain rivers avulse is important for elucidating autogenic dynamics and their role as controls on landscape change and stratigraphic architectures. An outstanding question exists, however, as to whether measures of avulsion frequency are inherently affected by the spatial and temporal scales at which they are evaluated, which has implications regarding our ability to make direct comparisons between different river systems or deltas. To address this problem, a quantitative analysis of the avulsion histories of 57 coastal-plain river systems is undertaken. Nine alternative measures of avulsion frequency are extracted. These are based on numbers of (i) avulsion events, (ii) active or abandoned channel courses, and (iii) delta lobes, all considered per unit time. Additional sets of avulsion-frequency proxies are established based on normalization of these numbers relative to the size of the area being studied, and to the number of distinct river systems that drain into that area. The sensitivity of these quantities to the spatial and temporal extent of study areas and time intervals, and their relationships with quantities describing the scale of the river systems, are assessed. All avulsion-frequency estimates demonstrate apparent negative relationships with the timespan over which they are determined; this may reflect global Holocene trends, or variations in resolution with the time window. Avulsion metrics that are not normalized by the planform extent of the study area do not show proportionality with the size of the study areas themselves, nor with the scale of the river systems; correspondingly, the spatio-temporal density of avulsion events tends to be higher for smaller rivers and associated study areas. This may be due to systematic variations in data resolution, to the influence of external controls that relate to the scale of deltas, or to inherent non-stationarity in the avulsion dynamics of lowland rivers, in association with forms of self-organization that do not vary with scale. Although non-normalized avulsion-frequency estimates do not scale with measures of river-system size, they are seen to correlate with progradation rates, which are themselves scaled to sediment discharge and catchment size. Practical considerations can be drawn on how avulsion frequency may be appropriately quantified to enable meaningful comparisons of the autogenic dynamics of coastal-plain rivers. ]\n","34\n","iteracion 35\n","[ Variability of trace metals in coastal and estuary: Distribution, profile, and drivers ]\n","35\n","[ Highlights Trace-metal distributions in ocean systems have been classified into conservative-, nutrient-, and scavenged-type profiles Several variability drivers of trace metals may be involved in differences of metal distribution in particular ocean systems The availability of dissolved trace metals is likely to increase in the future due to increasing SST, decreasing pH or decreasing DO Suspended matter which generally derives from terrestrial input plays a role in determining the fate of trace metals The study findings improve our understanding of trace-metal characteristics in the marine environment , Ongoing global changes such as increasing sea-surface temperatures, decreasing acidity levels, and expanding oxygen-minimum zone may impact on the biogeochemical cycles of trace metals in ocean systems.

We examined the multi-decadal geomorphic evolution of the Massa coastal sector and the main drivers of this evolution, based on an analysis of aerial photographs and satellite images from 1970 to 2020. We also monitored beach topography from January 2019 to July 2020 to determine short-term shoreline response to seasonal variations in wave conditions, and how this ties up with the longer time frame. The long-term pattern is essentially controlled by a balance, in the shoreline position, between the erosional cliff line, aeolian dune sand accumulation, and longshore sediment transport . The beaches show a seasonal regime that conforms to the classical cut in winter and accretion in summer. Sediment supply from the Massa has been curtailed by the Youssef Ben Tachfine dam constructed in 1972, but limited sand supplies from wave erosion of the aeolianite cliffs and reworking of the aeolian dunes assure overall shoreline stability. These sources are very likely complemented by carbonate sand from the wave-dominated shoreface. Periodic sand trapping and release occur within the Massa mouth, often sand-blocked but reopened during floods. The future sediment-budget equilibrium of the Massa littoral cell will depend on the continuity of these sources of sediment supply. The aeolianite cliffs and large aeolian dunes are significant sources of sediment that could mitigate, as along much of the Atlantic coast of Morocco, the expected shoreline retreat from sea-level rise. ]\n","38\n","iteracion 39\n","[ Heavy metal pollution in coastal wetlands: A systematic review of studies globally over the past three decades ]\n","39\n","[ Highlights The first holistic systematic review of studies on heavy metal pollution in coastal wetlands globally.

Trends varied greatly among coastal countries, and global trends were primarily driven by the US before 2000, and in China after 2010. We also found that mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), and copper (Cu) were the most widely studied HM elements globally, but patterns differed geographically, with Hg being most widely examined in the Americas, Cd in China and India, and lead (Pb) in the western Europe and Australia, respectively. Among different types of coastal wetlands, salt marshes, mangrove forests, and estuaries were the most widely studied, in contrast to seagrass beds and tidal flats .

Therefore, the process of assessing the conservation status of coastal habitats remains complicated to implement because methodological approaches are mainly dominated by expert statements. Moreover, all the procedures of the HD are carried out within each member country and the final assessments are often the synthesis of these partial assessments. However, the multiscalar approach and the use of innovative technologies (databases, remote sensing) can be particularly relevant to develop replicable approaches and facilitate monitoring and the implementation of management measures. ]\n","41\n","iteracion 42\n","[ The intrinsic primary bioreceptivity of concrete in the coastal environment – A review ]\n","42\n","[ Highlights Chemo-attractive properties in concrete that attract marine organisms are likely to be spatio-temporally limited. Increasing concrete roughness generally enhances bioreceptivity but textures should be varied to maximise biodiversity. Longer-term experiments have shown little difference in bioreceptivity once carbonation and faunal succession has commenced. , The proliferation of artificial concrete structures (ACSs) in the marine environment causes intertidal habitat loss and is a poor surrogate for natural rocky shores in terms of species richness, abundance, and community composition. As hard engineered coastlines increase, there is growing interest in how new concrete structures can facilitate improved habitat and biodiversity compared to existing concrete structures. Experiments that have substituted cement binder and aggregates in varying proportions and combinations have demonstrated that it is possible to enhance the primary bioreceptivity of concrete, either chemically or via microtopographical texture. This review synthesises key literature and identifies which concrete formulas prove most effective at enhancing bioreceptivity and those that have limited value, providing recommendations for coastal practitioners and for formulas that warrant further study. It is evident that the efficacy of chemical bioreceptivity of concrete is likely to be spatio-temporally limited (months) and enhancing surface roughness should be prioritised as a way to enhance colonisation. However, both chemical and physical methods require further investigation in within in situ marine settings for longer durations (&gt;12 months). ]\n","42\n","iteracion 43\n","[ Biodiversity impacts by multiple anthropogenic stressors in Mediterranean coastal wetlands ]\n","43\n","[ Highlights We reviewed 54 studies describing biodiversity impacts in Mediterranean coastal wetlands. Eutrophication and chemical contamination effects have been largely studied. Studies assessing interactions between more than one stressor are very limited. Non-additive responses to multiple stressors are frequently observed. A holistic approach is needed to define appropriate ecosystem management measures. , Mediterranean coastal wetlands are considered biodiversity hot-spots and contain a high number of endemic species . The biodiversity of these ecosystems is endangered by several pressures resulting from agricultural and urban expansion, climate change, and the alteration of their hydrological cycle . In this study we assess the state-of-the-art regarding the impact of several stressor groups on the biodiversity of Mediterranean coastal wetlands ( i.e. , lagoons , marshes, estuaries). Particularly, we describe the impacts of eutrophication , chemical pollution, invasive species , salinization , and temperature rise, and analyze the existing literature regarding the impact of multiple stressors on these ecosystems. Our study denotes a clear asymmetry both in terms of study areas and stressors evaluated. The majority of studies focus on lagoons and estuaries of the north-west parts of the Mediterranean basin, while the African and the Asian coast have been less represented. Eutrophication and chemical pollution were the most studied stressors compared to others like temperature rise or species invasions. Most studies evaluating these stressors individually show direct or indirect effects on the biodiversity of primary producers and invertebrate communities, and changes in species dominance patterns that contribute to a decline of endemic populations. The few available studies addressing stressor interactions have shown non-additive responses, which are important to define appropriate ecosystem management and restoration measures. Finally, we propose research needs to advance our understanding on the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on Mediterranean coastal wetlands and to guide future interventions to protect biodiversity. ]\n","43\n","iteracion 44\n","[ Integrating indigenous and local knowledge in management and research on coastal ecosystems in the Global South: A literature review ]\n","44\n","[ Highlights Research on ILK from coastal ecosystems in the Global South is still understudied. Inclusion of ILK can have ecological, political and socio-cultural benefits. Integration of ILK is challenged by external forces, and collaboration and government structures. Ridgid and purely natural science based research methods can challenge the integration of ILK. , Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) is increasingly recognized as a valuable asset in sustainability science. Knowledges of Indigenous peoples and local communities is becoming a critical tool for understanding coastal social-ecological systems and coping with global changes. The inclusion of ILK in research and management is key to local desirable social-ecological resilience and community-based conservation approaches, especially in areas with accelerated landscape changes. The Global South in particular is experiencing rapid changes through development and climate change, while harbouring many biodiversity hotspots. To synthesize the existing information and highlight still existing research gaps we conducted a systematic literature review on ILK from coastal ecosystems in the Global South ( n = 254). Our results show to which biophysical aspects and ecosystems the knowledge is related, as well as the challenges and benefits that accompany the inclusion of ILK for management and research. Main challenges named were based on external forces, such as globalisation and market pressure but also a lack of integration and respect in governance and management for ILK and the difficulty of integrating ILK in today's academic work. Many researchers showed ways to overcome such multi-scale challenges and highlighted the importance of this process due to the various benefits of ILK for management and research. All articles reviewed named benefits in ecological (e.g. complementary knowledge production), political (e.g. support of community-based governance) or socio-cultural (e.g. maintenance of culture and livelihoods) aspects for management and research. Maintaining ILK is crucial for Indigenous people and local communities and carries insights to govern coastal ecosystems during the challenging times ahead. We conclude that future research is needed to further develop the current position of ILK in research and management of ecosystems, especially as global environmental changes may contribute to the acceleration of losing ILK from coastal ecosystems in the Global South. ]\n","44\n","iteracion 45\n","[ Tectonosedimentary evolution of the Coastal Cordillera and Central Depression of south-Central Chile (36°30′-42°S) ]\n","45\n","[ The forearc of south-central Chile (36°30′-42°S) is characterized by the presence of a Coastal Cordillera and a low lying area known as the Central Depression. The origin of these morphostructural units has been largely debated. They have been ascribed to different ages between the Cretaceous and the Pliocene , and tectonic causes that involve extensional or contractional deformation and have been related to Andean evolution or accretionary processes in the forearc. To investigate the geologic evolution of the Coastal Cordillera and Central Depression in the cited area, we based on stratigraphy, sedimentology , geochronology (U Pb, LA-ICP-MS), structural geology , and geomorphology. Our studies, which are based on our own data and a thorough bibliographic review, indicate the following sequence of events in the tectono-sedimentary evolution of the forearc of south-central Chile during the late Cenozoic. The area was subjected to extensional tectonics caused by slab rollback during the Oligocene-early Miocene , resulting in the genesis of a series of basins filled with volcanic, continental, and marine deposits that extended from the present Chilean coast to the retroac. The extensional basins were tectonically inverted during the late Early-Late Miocene , and most of the forearc became a positive relief that was subjected to fluvial erosion. The West Andean Thrust, a major reverse west verging fault in the limit between the Central Depression and the Andean Cordillera, caused significant uplift of the western flank of the Andes. This triggered flexural subsidence and the accumulation of coarse-grained deposits in the forearc during the Pliocene-Pleistocene. The sudden increase of sediment flux to the trench during this period caused a change from non-accretion or subduction erosion to accretion in the margin of south-central Chile. Progressive growth of the accretionary wedge gave birth to a forearc high, the Coastal Cordillera, which was uplifted in the last 2 Ma. Some forearc areas placed above subducted oceanic fracture zones did not experience uplift during this period due to the significant transport of fluid that inhibited the deformation of the accretionary wedge. Our studies show that the late Cenozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the forearc in the study area is complex and involves different processes related to Andean evolution in the first stage and accretionary processes acting exclusively in the forearc in a second stage. The Coastal Cordillera and the Central Depression of south-central Chile were developed in the last 2 Ma and are much younger than classically considered. ]\n","45\n","iteracion 46\n","[ The changing paradigm of coastal management: The Portuguese case ]\n","46\n","[ Highlights Traditional and contemporary decision-making processes on coastal issues are reviewed.

This was addressed in an essentially physical manner. Today, concerns are no longer limited to safety; lifestyle and quality of life have become essential components in the successful construction of coastal infrastructure. Other aspects of development have also become important, such as environmental impact, attractiveness and sustainability . New social realities must be addressed, as must the voices of actors and interest groups. The synthesis of recent concerns over coastal public works projects has become increasingly difficult due to new assumptions of value, social acceptance and the sustainability of these projects. In this context, it is now common knowledge that decision-making on a coastal issue should be based on multiple criteria, including technical effectiveness, costs, benefits, implementation and monitoring. Here, coastal issues are reviewed using the dual perspective of meeting current needs and ensuring future sustainability. It is shown that multifunctional facilities built near the coast are one viable solution for managing coastal erosion . The results of a case study conducted in a sensitive area of the Portuguese coast are also presented. Based on an exhaustive review of the literature, it is also shown that improving nautical sports and generating renewable energy should not be neglected.

This study aims to retrieve the Chl-a distribution in Yanam and Kakinada turbid coastal waters using Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) and Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) algorithms from Sentinel-3 OLCI and Sentinel-2 MSI data. The FLH products show moderate correlation with retrieved and in-situ Chl-a data, whereas the MCI products show exceptionally good correlation with both the data. Assessment results show a better correlation between in-situ and retrieved Chl-a derived from Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 satellite data (R 2 = 0.858; R 2 = 0.883). The final results show that the S2MCI product gives the best results compared to S3MCI to retrieve Chl-a in the study area. Analysis results demonstrate that FLH algorithm and models are limited to the coastal area with Chl-a &lt; 4 mg/m 3 , whereas MCI algorithm is recommended for Chl-a &gt; 4 mg/m 3 . The S2MCI algorithm shows better performance with root mean square error (RMSE = 0.76) and mean absolute relative error (MARE = 1.14) for Chlorophyll retrieval compared with other algorithms. The MCI algorithm is more effectively used to retrieve the Chl-a in the study area. Moreover, this study also demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-3 OLCI and Sentinel-2 MSI satellite data for better observation and retrieval of Chl-a distribution over the turbid coastal waters. ]\n","48\n","iteracion 49\n","[ Informing a conservation policy-praxis disjuncture: A ‘commons’ perspective to tackling coastal-marine community-conserved area implementation in South Africa ]\n","49\n","[ Highlights Community-conserved areas (CCAs) can produce ecological and social outcomes.

CCAs also need social-ecological alignment, champions, and inclusive participation. , Conventional ‘people-free’ conservation often fails to deliver both social and ecological outcomes. Community-based conservation (CBC) – which is underpinned by local community participation, knowledge and priorities – offers a viable alternative in certain contexts. We explore the applicability of established ‘commons’ design principles, and factors enabling community-based conservation, to community-based coastal and marine conservation initiatives in South Africa. An extensive review of relevant South African literature, complemented by interviews conducted with diverse conservation actors, operating within wildlife, forestry and coastal and marine contexts in the country, identified common social and institutional ‘constraints’ and ‘enablers’ that affected these conservation initiatives. Key constraints include slow and complex institutional processes (particularly associated with land restitution in protected areas), a lack of political will and limited local community participation in planning and decision-making, all of which affect required collaboration. Key enablers include greater understanding and alignment of initiatives with social and ecological contexts and priorities, formalized and improved community participation, and increased partner support, as well as the presence of local champions to inform, motivate, and facilitate the implementation and management of CBC initiatives. While the objective is to provide an updated list of ‘enablers’ informing the South African coastal and marine CBC context, insights gained should be relevant to other national sectors, as well as regional and global conservation actors attempting to translate ‘people-centred’ conservation policies into practice, particularly those fulfilling obligations to the Convention on Biological Diversity's Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. ]\n","49\n","iteracion 50\n","[ When are payment for ecosystems services suitable for coral reef derived coastal protection?: A review of scientific requirements ]\n","50\n","[ Highlights Insufficient finance is a key hindrance to coral reef management.

Such schemes have not been tested to our knowledge, for coral reef derived coastal protection, which is a key Ecosystem Service (ES) for many nations bordered by tropical coral reefs. Coral health is deteriorating globally, as are their ES and inadequate finance is identified as a cross cutting factor stymieing management action. In this paper, we assessed the feasibility of PES for coastal protection, with a focus on the scientific requirements. Key PES elements related solely to ecological processes were isolated, the role of coral reefs in protecting beaches reviewed and priority management options for improving reef health synthesized. Outputs indicate that there is adequate scientific knowledge to satisfy a PES. While there is limited ability to prove and quantify causality between management actions and ES delivery, PES criteria can be satisfied with the substitution of a management proxy, rather than payments being conditional on ES measurements. Management, both passive and active, would focus on aintaining reefs that already have a protective function and front stable beaches, above a functioning threshold. ]\n","50\n","iteracion 51\n","[ Key research issues of coastal storm analysis ]\n","51\n","[ Highlights Reviews key research issues of coastal storm analysis.

Regarding the coastal areas, the effects are related inter alias to the sea level rise , but also the increase and the severity of storms incidence. In conjunction with the astronomical tide, coastal storms can cause extreme wave runup and overtopping phenomena in ports, and coastal structures, the consequences of which may be disastrous, mainly affecting the operation and the reliability of infrastructure.

The wakame farms rely entirely on natural nutrient supplies, and fluctuating nutrient conditions beyond human control make it difficult to maintain yield and quality.

Therefore, this study examined nutrient fluctuations by observing the spatial distribution of nitrate concentrations in the nearshore and offshore waters off Sanriku coast during autumn–winter in 2012–2018, with a particular focus on November when coastal wakame nurseries bloom and are particularly sensitive to nutrient concentrations. The nutrient supply to the surface layer in the nearshore areas could be controlled by both vertical convection and horizontal advection . Local vertical convection and the Tsugaru Warm Current water mass were important for increasing the surface nitrate concentration in this area. Moreover, one feasible horizontal advection, i.e., the Tsugaru Warm Current flowing from offshore to the nearshore waters by its gyre mode formation, determined the nitrate concentrations around wakame farms. ]\n","52\n","iteracion 53\n","[ System controls of coastal and open ocean oxygen depletion ]\n","53\n","[ Highlights The epoch of the Anthropocene , a period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment, has witnessed a decline in oxygen concentrations and an expansion of oxygen-depleted environments in both coastal and open ocean systems since the middle of the 20th century.

An improved site-specific modulated transfer function is designed for nearshore wave analysis using video imagery, for a high energy coast. Issues from the impacts of sunlight on video imagery are significantly addressed during the pre-monsoon period. , Continuous collection of hydrodynamic data from the nearshore region by deploying marine instruments is challenging, mainly because of the huge cost and risk involved in keeping these sophisticated instruments in the highly dynamic nearshore region, since the area is often subjected to harsh environmental conditions. In such situations, adoption of remote sensing methods like use of land-based camera stations for continuous monitoring is advantageous due to its low risk and cost-effective features and ability to provide data during extreme events. In this connection, National Centre for Earth Science Studies (NCESS) has initiated a pilot project for continuous coastal monitoring, adopting the video-based monitoring method in India through an indigenous Video Beach Monitoring System (VBMS). The first VBMS station, comprising of four cameras have been installed at Valiathura, a typical high energy beach in SW coast of India and the software tools for deriving coastal morpho-hydro dynamic characteristics from video imagery are being developed. For estimation of wave characteristics, the use of linear transfer function methods has limitations in highly dynamic nearshore environments and the varying sunlight conditions during AN sessions along west coasts will also have serious impacts on the analysis. These difficulties can be addressed by adopting a modulated transfer function (MTF) approach. In this paper, an improved nearshore wave analysis from video timestacks, using MTF approach is discussed. The developed MTF uses multi-tapered spectral methods wherein the periodograms are averaged to reduce the effect of non-linearities as well as the variations due to sunlight in the spectral density.

China has taken a series of measures to control coastal degradation including coastline restoration, coastal wetland recovery, and coastal ecological corridor designation and development. These measures are reflected by longer areas of natural coastline, larger coastal wetland areas and stable numbers and diversity of species present in coastal ecosystems today. Although China’s coastal restoration efforts have borne fruit, outstanding challenges remain: (1) many coastal ecosystems have yet to be improved; (2) many restoration projects have only a short duration; (3) the acceptance standards for restoration projects are not comprehensive; (4) many restoration projects are operated on a small scale; (5) the source of restoration funds is often limited to a single channel; and (6) no strong theoretical or practical support is provided for most projects.

To deal with the challenges, the present study puts forward the following suggestions: (1) implement restoration projects systematically and on a large spatial scale; (2) improve the current project management system; (3) diversify the source of restoration funds; and (4) strengthen theoretical and technological research on coastal zone restoration. ]\n","60\n","iteracion 61\n","[ Comment on “Biogeochemical cycling of iron (hydr-)oxides and its impact on organic carbon turnover in coastal wetlands: A global synthesis and perspective” [Earth-Science Reviews (2021) 103658] ]\n","61\n","[]\n","61\n","iteracion 62\n","[ Farmed shrimp aquaculture in coastal wetlands of Latin America — A review of environmental issues. ]\n","62\n","[ Highlights The production records of Penaeus vannamei compiled by FAO indicate that the cultivated biomass increased 37.6 times in the period 2000-2020 worldwide Ecuador with proportionally less territory than Mexico and Brazil produce more than 50% of the shrimp farmed in the western hemisphere GIS tools show great differences in the estimation of mangrove and shrimp ponds areas in the last 5 years, apparently mangroves are increasing in America There are great differences in the criteria established in regulations of shrimp producing countries, especielly in organic enrichment parameters Environmental management systems for aquaculture in developed nations are inclusive, in less devolped countries is centralized , The world production of farmed Whiteleg shrimp was 5,812,180 t in 2020.

Accurately assessing multiple stressor effects is essential for predicting stressor impacts and informing management to efficiently and effectively mitigate potentially complex ecological responses. Extracting relevant information on multiple stressor studies conducted specifically within coastal wetlands is not possible from existing reviews, posing challenges in highlighting knowledge gaps and guiding future research. Here, we systematically review manipulative studies that assess multiple anthropogenic stressors within saltmarsh, mangrove , and seagrass ecosystems. In the past decade, there has been a rapid increase in publications, with seagrasses receiving the most attention (76 out of a total of 143 studies). Across all studies, nutrient loading and temperature were tested most often ( N = 64 and N = 48, respectively), while the most common stressor combination was temperature with salinity ( N = 12). Stressor application and study design varied across ecosystems. Studies are mostly conducted in highly controlled environments, without considering how natural variations in the physicochemical environment of coastal ecosystems may influence stressor intensity and timing under these conditions. This may result in vastly different ecological responses across levels of biological organisation. Shifting focus from univariate analytical approaches to multivariate, particularly path analysis, will help elucidate complex ecological relationships and highlight direct and indirect effects of multiple stressors in coastal ecosystems. There is a solid foundation of multiple stressor research in coastal wetlands. However, we recommend future research enhance ecological realism in experimental design by studying the effects of stressor combinations whilst accounting for spatiotemporal variability that reflects natural conditions of coastal ecosystems. ]\n","63\n","iteracion 64\n","[ Bright Spots in Coastal Marine Ecosystem Restoration ]\n","64\n","[ The United Nations General Assembly calls for ecosystem restoration to be a primary intervention strategy used to counter the continued loss of natural habitats worldwide, while supporting human health and wellbeing globally. Restoration of coastal marine ecosystems is perceived by many to be expensive and prone to failure, in part explaining its low rates of implementation compared with terrestrial ecosystems . Yet, marine ecosystem restoration is a relatively new field, and we argue that assessments of its potential to answer this call should not rely on typical outcomes, but also to learn from successful outliers. Here, we review successful restoration efforts across a suite of metrics in coastal marine systems to highlight ‘bright spots’. We find that, similar to terrestrial systems, restoration interventions can be effective over large spatial expanses (1,000s–100,000s ha), persist for decades, rapidly expand in size, be cost-effective, and generate social and economic benefits. These bright spots clearly demonstrate restoration of coastal marine systems can be used as a nature-based solution to improve biodiversity and support human health and wellbeing. Examining coastal marine restoration through a historical lens shows that it has developed over a shorter period than restoration in terrestrial systems, partially explaining lower efficiencies. Given these bright spots and the relative immaturity of coastal marine ecosystem restoration, it is likely to advance rapidly over the coming decades and become a common intervention strategy that can reverse marine degradation, contribute to local economies, and improve human wellbeing at a scale relevant to addressing global threats. ]\n","64\n","iteracion 65\n","[ The nexus of macroplastic and microplastic research and plastic regulation policies in the Philippines marine coastal environments ]\n","65\n","[ Highlights MP and macroplastic studies in the Philippines marine coastal environment were synthesized.

An observable growing number of plastic regulation policies coincide with the increase on plastic research. , The Philippines was reported as one of the top plastic polluters (macroplastics and microplastics (MPs)) to the marine coastal environment, which necessitated the development and enforcement of plastic regulation policies. However, the nexus between the growing research on macroplastic/MP and the plastic regulation policies in the country is unexplored. Current review suggests that macroplastic/MP research in the Philippines is still in its infancy owing to methodological and technological constraints to apportion the sources and fluxes, characterize macroplastics/MPs, and identify influencing socio-environmental factors. While government efforts are underway, it is also unclear if local researches on macroplastics/MPs were the basis in institutionalizing the existing plastic regulation policies.

Microplastic level in Chinese seas was moderate or lower compared to other countries. , China is considered to account for nearly a third of all plastic waste discharging from land to the ocean. To overall assess microplastic pollution status in Chinese coastal and marginal seas , this study summarized the abundance and characteristics of microplastics in the seawater, sediments and marine organisms. The results showed that the abundance of microplastics in the seawater of four major seas of China was 0.13–545 items/m³, and microplastic abundance in the sediments from the estuaries was 20–7900 items/kg, which are at middle level or even lower than those detected in other countries. By contrast, severe microplastic pollution was recorded in the estuaries, suggesting that plastic waste and microplastic interception measures should be conducted on the rivers to prevent the input of microplastics. In addition, microplastics were widely detected in marine fishes, mollusks, zooplankton, mammals and birds, which highlights the potential impacts of microplastic pollution on the whole marine ecosystem . Compared to the dry season, higher microplastic abundance was found in the rainy season, revealing that plastic waste recycling should be strengthened before the onset of rainy season. We suggest that all countries respond actively to the ubiquitous microplastic pollution through practical policies and measures to prevent microplastics from further damaging the marine ecosystem. ]\n","66\n","iteracion 67\n","[ Comparing geological and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry data of the Sele River coastal plain, southern Italy: Implications for recent subsidence trends ]\n","67\n","[ Highlights Study of the subsidence pattern from the Sele River coastal plain, southern Italy Subsidence map obtained combining two decades of InSAR and geological-geomorphic data. Land-use data were taken into account to better define the role of anthropogenic impact. Multidisciplinary approach to understand the causes of subsidence in coastal plains , Many coastlines around the world are subsiding, often due to tectonic causes. In tectonically active areas, the exploitation of natural resources has caused acceleration of subsidence rates. In these cases, it is difficult to separate the many different components of the subsidence process. We try to fill this gap, using both remote sensing data and geological evidence, in an area located in southern Italy (Sele River plain) and characterized by the presence of both human activities and natural processes. The coastal sector of the Sele plain shows a complex subsidence pattern, as testified by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PS InSAR) data related to a period of about two decades (1992–2010), that we put in correlation with stratigraphical data from both outcrops and boreholes (ca. 250). The Quaternary infill of the coastal sectors of the plain is not laterally isotropic and homogeneous because of the presence of layers of clastic sediments with different degrees of compaction. Dunal and beach sands, back-ridge (lagoonal and palustrine) silty clays , palaeosols and thick peaty layers are the main facies of this sedimentary prism. The back-ridge depressions hosted palustrine and marshy environments and were artificially drained in the last centuries. The main output of the PS- InSAR analysis is a map of vertical ground deformation (VGD), which has been a useful tool to understand the causes of the subsidence process if combined with geological data from field and boreholes. In fact, the overlay of the SAR interferometry VGD map with the geomorphological and stratigraphical features shows that the subsidence is higher in the northern sector of the plain, where the Quaternary alluvial-coastal deposits are thicker because of the structural asymmetry of the graben . The maximum subsidence rate, however, can be observed in the central part of the plain, in correspondence of the Sele, Tusciano and Picentino river mouths and in the coastal belt. This could be related to the thickness of loose sediments (&gt;20 m) and to the presence of still compacting clay-rich sediments. In the southernmost sector the rates are the lowest recorded in the plain due to the minor thickness of Holocene deposits and to the presence of very thick sedimentary bodies of travertine . The understanding of subsidence patterns may represent a basic tool for future studies about the assessment of the coastal inundation hazard and related risk mitigation in the Sele River plain . Such a tool may reinforce the methodological approach to risk assessment in similar morphological settings. ]\n","67\n","iteracion 68\n","[ Has marine technology innovation promoted the high-quality development of the marine economy? ——Evidence from coastal regions in China ]\n","68\n","[ Highlights A comprehensive weight model is used to calculate the marine technology innovation index in China's coastal regions.

The nonlinear relationship between marine technology innovation and the growth of GTFP of the marine economy is examined. , In recent years, the Chinese government attaches great importance to the development of a high-quality marine economy. The Ministry of Natural Resources issued the opinions on promoting the high-quality development of the marine economy, which pointed out that technology innovation should play a leading role in the high-quality development of the marine economy. In this paper, we use a comprehensive weight model including the entropy method and the best-worst method (BWM) to measure the level of marine technology innovation in China's coastal regions from 2006 to 2016. Then, we use the threshold regression model to examine the role of marine technology innovation in the high-quality development of the marine economy. The results show that there is a nonlinear relationship between marine technology innovation and high-quality development of the marine economy. Furthermore, we find that when the level of marine technology innovation exceeds a certain threshold, its promotion effect of the high-quality development of the marine economy gradually weakens.

Some studies have investigated short-term interactions, and some models predict short turnover times at the sediment surface on open shorelines .

In this article, based on peer-reviewed papers, the sources, spatial patterns, driving factors, and environmental implications of antibiotics and ARGs in global estuarine and coastal environments are discussed.

These ecosystems, that are often maintained by direct or indirect groundwater supplies, are collectively known as groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs). The importance of groundwater supplies is greatly exacerbated in coastal Mediterranean regions where the lack of surface water and the over-development of anthropogenic activities critically threaten the sustainability of coastal GDEs and associated ecosystem services. Yet, coastal GDEs do not benefit from a legal or managerial recognition to take into account their specificity. Particular attention should be paid to the characterization of environmental and ecological water requirements. The hydrogeological knowledge about the management and behavior of coastal aquifers and GDEs must be strengthened. These investigations must be supplemented by a stronger assessment of potential contaminations to develop local land-uses and human activities according to the groundwater vulnerability. The quantitative management of water resources must also be better supervised and/or more constrained in order to ensure the water needs necessary to maintain coastal GDEs.

Major chronic issues such as untreated sewage remain overlooked. , Pollution is a major worldwide problem that is increasing with urban growth, mainly along coastal areas. Pollution is often worse, governance is poorer and managerial strategies to improve environmental quality are less advanced in developing than developed countries. Here, we present an overview of the current scientific knowledge of the impacts of contamination on the biota of coastal ecosystems of Brazil and evaluate the scientific challenges to provide baseline information for local managerial purposes. We compiled data from 323 peer-reviewed published papers from the extensive Brazilian coast. We critically evaluated the produced knowledge (target contaminants, sources, ecosystems, taxa, response variables) and the science behind it (rigour and setting) within its socioenvironmental context (land occupation, use of the coast, sanitation status, contamination history). Research was driven largely by environmental outcomes of industrial development with a focus on the single effects of metals on the biota. The current knowledge derives mainly from laboratory manipulative experiments or from correlative field studies of changes in the biota with varying levels of contamination. Of these, 70% had problems in their experimental design. Environmental impacts have mainly been assessed using standard indicators of populations, mostly in ecotoxicological studies. Benthic assemblages have mostly been studied using structural indicators in field studies. Future assessments of impacts should expand research to more taxonomic groups and ecosystem compartments, adding combined functional and structural responses. Furthermore, further investigations need to consider the interactive effects of contaminants and other environmental stressors. By doing so, researchers would deliver more robust and effective results to solve problems of pollution. ]\n","72\n","iteracion 73\n","[ Occurrence and toxicity of perfluoroalkyl acids along the estuarine and coastal regions under varied environmental factors ]\n","73\n","[ Highlights PFAAs are globally detected in the water, sediment and organisms in the estuarine and coastal regions.

The bioaccumulation and toxicity of PFAAs are affected by varied environmental factors. , Due to the significant economic and ecological value, the increasing pollution threat to estuarine and coastal regions is of great concern. Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are emerging pollutants which possess adverse ecological risk. In this review, we have compiled the data on the levels of PFAAs in environmental samples, mainly in estuarine and coastal zones. A worldwide map was generated to show the distribution of PFAAs. The experimental results have also been considered, which, together with those of environmental samples, has allowed us to infer about the factors that intervene in the behavior of PFAAs. The presence of PFAAs is determined primarily by the source of pollution. Salinity is as well shown as a significant condition, dependent too on the sampling environment. The analysis of PFAAs from environmental samples constitutes a fundamental tool for the surveillance of these pollutants, but the lack of homogeneity of protocols for sampling, as well as for the results presentation, limits the comparative capacity. Laboratory studies are also an essential tool in the analysis of particular aspects related to PFAAs, but many times the conditions tested are not environmentally significant. In this way, it would not be prudent to establish “paradigms” about the behavior of the PFAAs in certain areas or organisms, instead to suggest the points that can be considered fundamental for each issue addressed. The main variables that appear to intervene in estuarine and coastal regions are mainly the proximity to the source of pollution, salinity, pH, precipitation (rain) as well as types of PFAAs. All these can synergistically lead to different impacts on the ecosystem. Therefore, the particular risks of PFAAs in estuarine and coastal regions is a set of multiple variables, dependent on each sampling condition and according to the previously named parameters. ]\n","73\n","iteracion 74\n","[ Research of traffic flow saturation on waters of the coastal ship routing system ]\n","74\n","[ Highlights Channel transit capacity is studied from the perspective of traffic flow saturation.

The focus of this paper is on physical processes, and we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art based on presentations and discussions at the meeting, which revolved around the four primary themes of parameterizations, numerical methods , in-situ and remote-sensing measurements, and high-performance computing. A primary outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to reduce subjectivity and improve reproducibility in modeling of physical processes in the coastal ocean. Reduction of subjectivity can be accomplished through development of standards for benchmarks, grid generation, and validation, and reproducibility can be improved through development of standards for input/output, coupling and model nesting, and reporting. Subjectivity can also be reduced through more engagement with the applied mathematics and computer science communities to develop methods for robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Such engagement could be encouraged through more collaboration between the forward and inverse modeling communities and integration of more applied math and computer science into oceanography curricula. Another outcome of the workshop was agreement on the need to develop high-resolution models that scale on advanced HPC systems to resolve, rather than parameterize, processes with horizontal scales that range between the depth and the internal Rossby deformation scale. Unsurprisingly, more research is needed on parameterizations of processes at scales smaller than the depth, including parameterizations for drag (including bottom roughness, bedforms , vegetation and corals), wave breaking, and air–sea interactions under strong wind conditions. Other topics that require significantly more work to better parameterize include nearshore wave modeling, sediment transport modeling, and morphodynamics . Finally, it was agreed that coastal models should be considered as key infrastructure needed to support research, just like laboratory facilities, field instrumentation, and research vessels.

However, the overall magnitude, trend, and environmental drivers of GHG fluxes in these wetlands of China remain uncertain. Herein, we synthesized data from 70 publications involving 187 field observations to identify patterns and drivers of GHG fluxes across coastal wetlands in China. Average methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fluxes, and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions (ecosystem respiration) across coastal wetlands were estimated as 2.20±0.31 mg·m -2 ·h -1 , 16.44±2.96 μg·m -2 ·h -1 , and 388.76±42.28 mg·m -2 ·h -1 , respectively. GHG emissions varied with tidal inundation, where CH 4 and CO 2 emissions during tidal inundation were lower than during ebbing. CH 4 and CO 2 emissions from wetlands decreased linearly with increasing latitude, while N 2 O did not. CH 4 fluxes were positively related to air temperature and aboveground biomass , and CO 2 emissions were positively related to soil organic carbon . N 2 O fluxes were lower with increasing soil pH, and CH 4 and CO 2 emissions were greater with increasing soil moisture. Based on the results of sustained-flux global warming potential and sustained-flux global cooling potential models, our paper indicate that the fluxes of CH 4 and N 2 O in coastal wetlands have a positive feedback to global warming, which is mainly driven by the CH 4 emission. Our synthesis improved understanding of the roles of coastal wetlands in the ecosystem C cycle under global change. We suggest that long-term field observations of GHG fluxes across a wider range of spatiotemporal scales are urgently required to improve the prediction accuracy in GHG fluxes and the assessment of net GHG balance and its contribution to the GWP of coastal wetlands. ]\n","79\n","iteracion 80\n","[ The impacts of wave energy conversion on coastal morphodynamics ]\n","80\n","[ Highlights We review studies that assess wave energy conversion impacts on morphodynamics.

Protected areas not only promote the conservation and provision of ecosystem services but are also key in building coastal communities' adaptive capacity and resilience in face of future scenarios. ]\n","81\n","iteracion 82\n","[ Key factors of the studies on benthic macroinvertebrate in coastal wetlands: Methods and biodiversity ]\n","82\n","[ This study aims to explore the biodiversity and influencing factors of macroinvertebrates in coastal wetlands at regional scale as well as the experimental sampling and analytical methods. Information from published scientific articles was compiled to analyze the habitat types, environmental variables, dominant species, sampler, mesh types, fixative solutions and analytical methods of macroinvertebrates in 104 coastal wetlands. Seven hotspots area have been identified in coastal wetlands. The low repetition rate of dominant species in the most studied area (estuary, intertidal zone and mangrove) indicated that environmental factors played decisive role in biodiversity. The species richness has significant correlation with temperature, pH, DO and BOD. Both biological indices and analysis methods have been employed successfully to analyze the relationship between the biodiversity of coastal benthic macroinvertebrate and environmental factors quantitatively and qualitatively. The selection of sampler (tube sampler, quadrat sampler and grab sampler) indicates the difference in the environment conditions at the study site, which is also affected by cost and efficiency. The mesh sieves (0.5 mm, 1.0 mm and others), which affected the workload of soil screening and the abundance of macroinvertebrates, suggested that researchers had different understandings of macroinvertebrate. While the selection of fixative solution such as alcohol and formalin should be also considered to meet the experimental demands because of their shortcomings (decolorization and acidity).

The practical use of this naturally occurring light signal in environmental research is, however, under-exploited, particularly in research focusing on optically complex waters such as inland and coastal waters. In this study, we investigated methodological and knowledge gaps in remote sensing of chlorophyll- a SIF in optically complex waters by reviewing the theory behind SIF occurrence, the availability of existing and upcoming instrumentation, the availability of SIF retrieval schemes, and the applications for aquatic research. Starting with an overview of factors that influence SIF leaving the water body, we further investigated available and upcoming observational capacity by in situ, airborne and satellite sensors . We discuss requirements for spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolution of observing systems in the context of SIF dynamics. We assessed viable retrieval techniques able to disentangle SIF from non-SIF contribution to the upwelling radiance, ranging from the established multispectral Fluorescence Line Height algorithm (FLH) approach to hyperspectral approaches including model inversion, spectral fitting methods and machine learning regression procedures. Finally, we provide an overview of applications, which could potentially benefit from improved SIF emission estimates such as biomass estimation, algal bloom investigation and primary productivity modelling. ]\n","83\n","iteracion 84\n","[ Climate Change, Human Impacts, and Coastal Ecosystems in the Anthropocene ]\n","84\n","[ Coastal zones, the world’s most densely populated regions, are increasingly threatened by climate change stressors — rising and warming seas, intensifying storms and droughts, and acidifying oceans.

Here we provide a review on interactions between climate change and local human impacts (e.g., interactions between sea level rise and anthropogenic land subsidence, which are forcing Indonesia to relocate its capital city) in the coastal realm. We highlight how these interactions can impair and, at times, decimate a variety of coastal ecosystems, and examine how understanding and incorporating these interactions can reshape theory on climate change impacts and ecological resilience . We further discuss implications of interactions between climate change and local human impacts for coastal conservation and elucidate the context when and where local conservation is more likely to buffer the impacts of climate change, attempting to help reconcile the growing debate about whether to shift much of the investment in local conservation to global CO 2 emission reductions. Our review underscores that an enhanced understanding of interactions between climate change and local human impacts is of profound importance to improving predictions of climate change impacts, devising climate-smart conservation actions, and helping enhance adaption of coastal societies to climate change in the Anthropocene. ]\n","84\n","iteracion 85\n","[ Coastal habitat squeeze: A review of adaptation solutions for saltmarsh, mangrove and beach habitats ]\n","85\n","[ Highlights We identify mechanisms and enabling conditions to accommodate migration of these habitats in Australia and the United States.

Marine microplastics predominantly originate near the coast and can remain in the nearshore zone for some time. However, at present, there is little understanding of the fate and transport of microplastics in coastal regions. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the physical processes involved in the movement of microplastics from estuaries to the continental shelf . The trajectory and speed of microplastics are controlled by their physical characteristics (density, size, and shape) and ocean dynamic conditions (wind, waves, tides, thermohaline gradients, and the influence of benthic sediments). Microplastic particles can be subjected to beaching, surface drifting, vertical mixing, and biofouling, as well as bed-load and suspended load transport processes, until reaching terminal deposition on beaches, in coastal marshes , in benthic sediments or until they are carried by ocean currents to subtropical convergence zones. The dynamic interaction of released microplastics with the shoreline is regulated by onshore/offshore transport, which is impacted by the source location as well as the geometry, vegetation, tidal regime, and wave direction. Wind and wave conditions dominate surface drifting of buoyant particles through Ekman drift, windage, and Stokes drift mechanisms. Neustic microplastic particles travel in the subsurface because of vertical mixing through wind-driven Langmuir circulation and heat cycling. Increasing accumulation of microplastics in benthic sediments needs to be quantitatively explored in terms of biofouling, deposition, entrainment, and transport dynamics. Further studies are required to understand the following: 1) the primary parameters (e.g., windage, terminal velocity , diffusivity , critical shear stress) that determine microplastic transport in different pathways; 2) dynamic distribution of microplastics in various coastal landscapes (e.g., wetlands , beaches, estuaries, lagoons , barrier islands, depocenters) regulated by hydrodynamic conditions; and 3) interactions between the physical transport processes and biochemical reactions (degradation, flocculation , biofouling, ingestions). ]\n","86\n","iteracion 87\n","[ Reply to comments by Thilo Rennert on “Biogeochemical cycling of iron (hydr-)oxides and its impact on organic carbon turnover in coastal wetlands: A global synthesis and perspective”.

Biomagnification effects of the same pollutant calculated by using TMF and BMF were similar. According to the values of TMF and BMF among all pollutants, the results indicated that there were 67 with low (1 &lt; TMF ≤ ≤ 4), 43 with greater (4 &lt; TMF ≤ ≤ 10), and 14 with the greatest risk (TMF &gt; 10) while 71 organic pollutants without biomagnification risk (TMF ≤ ≤ 1).

The effectiveness of biomagnification of the same pollutant was related to pollutant morphology, food webs, predator–prey relationships, the individual organism, the selection of wet weight and lipid weight and pollutant morphology. Thus, pollutant morphology, the accurate use of key parameters of trophic level , the strict screening of individual animals and the reasonable selection of wet weight and lipid weight are crucial.

The occurrence of environmentally related hazardous pollutants , such as toxic elements, and recalcitrant compounds in various environmental matrices has raised increasing concern. Different technologies have been developed for efficient removal and complete mitigation or degradation of these toxic elements from the aquatic environment . Among them, biosorption and bioaccumulation by renewable and biodegradable sources are of supreme interest and have not been reviewed much. For instance, the invasive seaweed Sargassum sp. has been spotted as a cost-effective natural material to capture targeted pollutants from the coastal ecosystem , which is currently becoming a pressing problem, around the globe, due to its unusual proliferation near tropical shores. This review is an effort to cover the left behind gap to present the multifunctional potentialities of Sargassum sp. biomass.

In this review, we first evaluated heavy metal pollution on the coasts by assembling the research on published metal concentrations in sediments and water bodies surrounding the Arabian Peninsula . Research revealed uneven pollution of heavy metals, meaning that before remediation, the most polluted sites should be found. This could be done most conveniently using biomonitoring. The Arabian Peninsula is a unique ecoregion due to the extremely high temperature in summer, and therefore, it needs its specific standardization procedure for biomonitoring. To get an overview of the current information on biomonitoring, we gathered a dataset of 306 published macroalgal observations from the Arabian Gulf and the Gulf of Aden. The heavy metal concentration dataset of macroalgae was analyzed with a multivariate principal component analysis. As a result of the published works elsewhere and our data analysis, we recommend that green Ulva and brown Padina species are used in the biomonitoring of heavy metal pollution on the Arabian Peninsula's eastern and southern coasts. However, more species might be needed if these species do not occur at the site. The species incidence should first be monitored systematically in each area, and common species should be used.

This topic includes morphological and functional interrelationships between beach ridges, barriers, and similar landforms . The term “beach ridge” was applied to a plethora of sub- and supratidal ridge types. In contrast, the presently proposed definition restricts the term to relict berm and foredune ridges, composed of sand or gravel and stabilized after isolation from shore zone of active processes. Barriers sustain paralic hydrology, sediment, biotic and nutrient condition in the coastal realm. In combination with adjacent lagoons and river deltas, these landforms represent physical barriers that lessen marine and related influences in brackish paralic-coastal environments. Benefiting from historic evolution of concepts and nomenclature, the task also involves the correction of misattributions rooted in early publications. Island, spit, and mainland barriers thus maintain lower salinities , reduce wave erosion, protect nutrient-rich paralic deposits and mitigate storm-induced inundation. “Fetch-limited lagoonal barrier islands” are considered valid barriers only in lagoons where they face inlet-transmitted full-marine conditions. “Mainland barriers” of several subcategories often are important sediment archives of past sea levels, hydroclimate, climate and tectonic-isostatic changes. They consist mostly of ridgeplains, at the start firmly attached or later migrated and welded to the mainland shore. In addition to local hydrodynamic and topographic influences, formation conditions may reflect overall paleogeographic conditions, including fluvial impact. In progradational (regressive) island settings, barriers islands of strandplains that laterally may alternate with narrow spit-like sectors. They include only single, marine, respectively, lagoon-side shore ridges, with secondary dune fields sandwiched between them. Field observations and drillcore studies of microfossil- and sediment-based depositional facies suggest that most barrier islands originated by the often underestimated shoal-aggradation mode. Two additional genetic models are recognizable; a fourth remains hypothetical. Remotely-sensed images indicate that post-hurricane regeneration of the largest deltaic barrier chain in the Gulf of Mexico stalled in recent years. Late Pleistocene barriers significantly influenced present coastal landforms in two extensive regions. Dramatic changes in past decades indicate that sea-level rise and stormier future hydroclimate may likely accelerate the degradation of deltaic and non-deltaic barrier islands. ]\n","101\n","iteracion 102\n","[ A systematic review of socio-economic assessments in support of coastal zone management (1992–2011) ]\n","102\n","[ Highlights A review of the literature on socio-economic assessments in support of CZM was carried out.

The review examines the links between the issues addressed by integrated assessments and the chosen analytical frameworks as well as the various economic assessment methods which are used in the successive steps of the coastal zone management process. The results show that i) analytical frameworks such as ‘risk and vulnerability’, ‘DPSIR’, ‘valuation’, ‘ecosystem services’ and ‘preferences’ are likely to lead to effective integration of social sciences in coastal zone management research while ‘integration’, ‘sustainability’ and ‘participation’ remain difficult to operationalize, ii) risk assessments are insufficiently implemented in developing countries, and iii) indicator systems in support of multi-criteria analyses could be used during more stages of the coastal zone management process.

There have been no reported captures of little brown bats ( M. lucifugus ), Indiana bats ( M. sodalis ), or tri-colored bats ( Perimyotis subflavus ) at the site post-WNS. Overall, we found mean hourly temperature, time since sunset, day of year, and year to be the most important predictors of bat activity levels for all examined species. Most non-hibernating, migratory species in our study demonstrated a positive relationship to mean temperature at the hourly timescale, whereas cave-hibernating bats tended to show a negative relationship to mean temperature during the time of year when they are expected to be active. Although most bat activity occurred in the late spring through early autumn, peaking in summer, some activity occurred periodically in the winter months, mostly attributable to the big brown bat ( Eptesicus fuscus ) and silver-haired bat ( Lasionycteris noctivigans ) phonic group. Unexpectedly, relationships of bat activity to wind and precipitation were largely equivocal. Initial presence (as early as March 30) and departure (between November 1–4) for northern long-eared bats at our study area occurred earlier in the spring and later in the fall than occurs for inland populations, suggesting that the species overwinters on Long Island rather than at inland karst caves or mines. A peak in spring activity characteristic of migratory behavior in the central Appalachians and Atlantic Coast was not observed at Fire Island, although Eastern red bats ( Lasiurus borealis ) and hoary bats (L. cinereus ) – both migratory species – did show a notable rise in activity in the late summer and early fall, suggesting these populations may migrate to and from Fire Island. Understanding the temporal and weather relationships to bat activity in this coastal environment may have important implications for tailoring more effective conservation and management strategies by identifying optimal timing for surveys, tracking bats during peak migratory windows, and providing insights that minimizes impacts to extant bats from activities such as wind-energy development or land management, i.e., forestry. ]\n","103\n","iteracion 104\n","[ Assessing the risk of utilizing tidal coastal wetlands for wastewater management ]\n","104\n","[ Highlights Nutrient additions from wastewater may shift ecosystem productivity, belowground biomass, and the root-to-shoot ratio.

In the southeastern United States, some communities rely on coastal wetlands for the management of secondarily treated effluents in forested and emergent wetlands. Advocates for this practice have argued that wetlands can assimilate nitrogen from wastewater, which can improve cypress-tupelo swamp productivity, and enhance marsh accretion rates to mitigate the effects of sea level rise . In contrast, evolving research on coastal wetlands and the environmental impacts of wastewater treatment pose new questions about the potential risks introduced by this practice. This review seeks to: (1) assess current research on plant productivity in fertilized coastal wetlands; (2) highlight the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in municipal wastewater operations; and (3) identify knowledge gaps. Nutrient additions via wastewater augmented aboveground productivity, but decreased belowground productivity and root-to-shoot ratios. Removal efficiencies of some PPCPs by coastal wetlands have been substantial (75% - 99%), but most remain unevaluated. Furthermore, their fate and effect on local ecosystem function and biogeochemical processes remain in question. This review demonstrates that there is more research needed at both local and watershed scales to evaluate how these risk factors impact ecosystem integrity and to better understand the tradeoffs with this wastewater management practice. ]\n","104\n","iteracion 105\n","[ Urban expansion, regeneration and socioenvironmental vulnerability in a mangrove ecosystem at the southeast coastal of São Paulo, Brazil ]\n","105\n","[ Highlights Land regularization is necessary to reduce irregular occupations on mangroves.

Land regularization and housing need to prevent low income dwellings expansion. Mangroves are a resilient coastal ecosystem with a natural recovery pattern. , Uncontrolled expansion of urban areas over mangrove systems is a historical threat for conservation and restoration of coastal landscapes. In Brazil, a country that presents one of the largest mangrove areas on the planet, recent political changes considered mangroves as “Permanent Preservation Areas” with the environmental function of preserving their ecosystem services. Under this regulation, mangrove deforestation is allowed in cases of regularization of irregular occupations and consolidated urban areas. However, these political changes may not be an effective to prevent mangrove deforestation in the country. This study aimed to analyze mangrove deforestation over twenty years in Santos and São Vicente estuarine region located at the Baixada Santista region (southeastern of Brazil), a highly vulnerable region subject to intense land use pressure by urban occupation and activities of the largest port of Latin America. Using remote sensing spatial analysis techniques, we analyzed if changes in Brazilian legislation has been reflected in degradation of mangrove forests over a period of twenty years due to the presence of vulnerable mangroves and accelerate land use pressure by urban occupation and activities of the largest port of Latin America. Findings show that, approximately 10.6 km 2 of mangroves in this region have been lost mainly due to irregular low-income occupation processes. The greatest gross loss occurred between the years 1999 and 2011 (8.1 km 2 ). Land regularization has caused mangrove reduction of only 0.03 km 2 in 2014, but it is possible that, in this case, mangrove forests were replaced by distinct vegetation physiognomy altering the original vegetation pattern. Demand for mangrove legislation that considers both social adaptation and legal protection has grown to support socioenvironmental vulnerability assessments. The data of this study can support environmental policy in a country that presents one of the largest mangrove areas on the planet. ]\n","105\n","iteracion 106\n","[ A critical review on various trophic transfer routes of microplastics in the context of the Indian coastal ecosystem ]\n","106\n","[ Highlights Bio-accumulation of microplastics in various marine food-chains studied Benthic algae and phytoplankton are the starting points.

Evidence has shown the increasing threat posed by accumulation of microplastics along shore lines and sandy beaches to the species that inhabit these ecosystems. This study evaluates the species at potential risk due to microplastic pollution along the coastal regions of India, through a combination of existing literature and original observations. The harmful effects of microplastics on various classes of aquatic and coastal species through both direct ingestion and indirect consumption by the process of bio-accumulation, have been discussed in this study. The species at risk in other ecosystems such as freshwater lakes, brackish water sites, swamplands and marshlands have also been covered. The various species recorded at these ecosystems were evaluated on the basis of their potential risk of consumption of microplastics. Potential routes for bioaccumulation of microplastics through trophic transfer have been proposed, with special emphasis on the routes involving those species at risk, in order to fill the existing knowledge gaps. Further studies in the Indian scenario are therefore necessary, in order to truly gauge the impact of the bioaccumulation in specific species and on the coastal ecosystem as a whole. ]\n","106\n","iteracion 107\n","[ A comprehensive review of compound inundation models in low-gradient coastal watersheds ]\n","107\n","[ Highlights Rainfall-runoff and storm surge interact in many forms at the coastal floodplain.

Four carbon offset methodologies have been approved for wetland restoration . Very few wetland restoration carbon offsets transected to date. Simplification of existing methodologies may facilitate adoption of blue C offsets. , Coastal wetlands have been valued for a variety of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and long term storage. The carbon sequestered and stored in coastal habitat including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds is termed as blue carbon. However, these systems are threatened mainly due to sea level rise, limited sediment supply, edge erosion, and anthropogenic influences. These habitats require restoration and conservation to continue providing ecosystem services. The incentive for emission reductions, referred to as carbon offsets, is well established for other ecosystems like forestry and agriculture. Some blue carbon offset methodologies or protocols have been certified by various voluntary carbon markets; however to date, a few wetland restoration carbon offset in the US has been transacted. Thus, the goal of this paper is to discuss the existing carbon market and carbon market methodologies applicable to coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the US. Currently, four wetland carbon offset methodologies have been approved in the carbon market. These methodologies are site and/or project-specific depending on the type of the wetlands, vulnerability to loss, and restoration need. The appropriate carbon stock and Green House Gas (GHG) emission assessment is the basis of determining carbon offsets. Simplification of the existing methodologies and development of new site and project-specific methodologies could potentially help to realize blue carbon offsets in practice. The slowly growing demand for carbon offsets in the carbon market could potentially be fulfilled from the blue carbon pool. While this carbon offset is in the early stages, this review may help the inclusion of carbon offset component in the coastal restoration and conservation projects in United States and potentially across the globe. ]\n","108\n","iteracion 109\n","[ Sea level rise impacts on rural coastal social-ecological systems and the implications for decision making ]\n","109\n","[ Highlights Rural coastal regions are vulnerable because of their remoteness and poverty.

To better plan for future sea level changes in these regions, an interdisciplinary approach to assess the social and environmental impacts of sea level rise and their dynamic feedbacks is important. In this paper, we use a socio-ecological system framework to investigate sea level rise impacts to the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula, a rural, low-lying coastal region in eastern North Carolina. Specifically, we show that 42% of the region could be inundated and property losses of up to US $14 billion could be incurred with 100 cm of sea level rise. We also synthesize the impacts of sea level rise on the region’s social-ecological system and present strategies to strengthen the adaptive capacity of the ecosystem, markets and communities.

The ICZM in Penang is almost halfway through. The selected ICZM evaluation methodology should match local specificity. , This study aimed to evaluate the efforts associated with Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) in the state of Penang, Malaysia. After reviewing the different methodologies in evaluating ICZM, two approaches were selected as recommended by Billé (2007) and Gallagher (2010). It was anticipated that by merging the results of the two approaches, each would be capable of filling the gaps of the other one. Interestingly, it was found that the two methodologies together provided a comprehensive evaluation of ICZM efforts. However, on the other hand, it was discovered that ICZM efforts in Penang were disadvantaged by the absence of an authoritative agency having overall responsibility, lack of horizontal and vertical integration between the different sectors and levels (regulations and acts concerning the coastal zone are implemented by different agencies at State and Federal levels), and poor institutional capacity. Although, in the present management system, adequate consideration has been given to communication and the participation of related stakeholders. Therefore, based on the findings of this study, ICZM in Penang is close to becoming an effective tool for managing coastal areas. However, the present management approach is proprietary. This paper contributes to the knowledge and understanding of ICZM in Penang, Malaysia. Further, the findings of this study will help in providing the means by which to assess ICZM nationally given regional evaluation is a prerequisite for evaluation at the national level in Malaysia. ]\n","110\n","iteracion 111\n","[ Climate vulnerability, impacts and adaptation in Central and South America coastal areas ]\n","111\n","[ Highlights Central and South America coasts are vulnerable to climate-related hazards.

This review paper focuses on the flexibility and feasibility of emerging ocean energy technologies in this region, including wave, tidal and ocean-current energy converters, floating photovoltaics , and offshore wind-turbines. Recent research on wave energy in the region has achieved advancements such as modifying oscillating water columns to exchange higher pneumatic energy, reshaping oscillating devices to capture more kinetic energy, and improving overtopping converters to absorb more incident waves. Regarding tidal energy , the paper reviews barrage-based and stream-based turbines and investigates the efficiency improvement, flexibility enhancement and adaptation to the unique regional features. Regarding ocean current energy, research on low-velocity turbines and optimized energy storage systems has made their application in the region more competitive.

The plethora and rapidly increasing number of sedimentary metal indices should, if not derived for special purposes, produce a consistent assessment on the basis that they use the same suite of metals and concentrations. Inconsistent numerical results produced by different index formulations should, when combined with their associated classification scheme, produce a common assessment of environmental condition. However, such a consistent outcome is seldom observed. Significant differences in assessment results are partly due to the historical evolution of indices and to the extraordinary diversity of background and reference values and materials being applied to account for pre-anthropogenic metal levels and confounding due to variable sediment characteristics. Size-normalised sample and background metal data used in the mCd and MEQ indices do not require reference values to account for textural variability and provide a quasi-direct measurement of enrichment with minimal computation (simple division). These priority indices should be combined into a single index (Enrichment Quotient, EQ). Results produced by the EF index were strongly correlated to mCd and MEQ and provide a similar classification and is recommended if normalised data are unavailable. Other indices assessed (MPI, PI, mPI, SEF, Igeo, PLI and Cf, original and current) provided a range of results, which either over- or under-estimated enrichment. The confusion concerning the choice and application of background and reference values in the assessment process is reviewed and their use in local and global assessment is clarified. Single- and combined-metal evaluations are recommended to provide detailed, local and more comprehensive assessments, respectively. ]\n","114\n","iteracion 115\n","[ Modeling wetland transitions and loss in coastal Louisiana under scenarios of future relative sea-level rise ]\n","115\n","[ Highlights Model results for coastal Louisiana show variation in future wetland loss.

Wetland loss responds to both linear (chronic) and non-linear (acute) stressors. Understanding the inundation tolerance for different species/mixtures is crucial. , This study uses modeling results for coastal Louisiana to examine spatial and temporal variation in future wetland loss, and how this variation is influenced by different causes of land loss represented in the modeled processes. Fifty-year model predictions illustrate specific vulnerabilities of the wetlands and the conditions under which they occur, e.g., long-term changes vs. specific events. Environmental scenarios were used to examine model sensitivity to changes in future patterns of precipitation, evapotranspiration , subsidence , and eustatic sea level rise . Based on the model results, the magnitude of wetland loss increases more than three-fold from low to high scenario. The model allows vegetation types to change over time as environmental conditions change. Each type is sensitive to different land-loss causing factors. Across all scenarios, the largest contributor to wetland loss is inundation loss of saline marsh -&gt;40% of loss. Inundation loss of brackish marsh increases from low to high scenarios. Salinity induced loss of fresh wetlands increases from low to high scenario and coastwide contributes &lt;10% of the total wetland loss. Marsh edge erosion is relatively consistent in magnitude across scenarios but its relative contribution decreases from low to high. Model outputs show two contrasting responses to environmental change over a 50-year simulation: a relatively linear response of land area over time, and a non-linear response where a large collapse event is triggered in a single year. Land loss varied dramatically over time within the 50-year simulations with little loss in the first two decades and high rates of loss 25–40 years into the future. Across most of the coast, and for all scenarios, the majority of land loss is caused by excessive inundation. Understanding the threshold conditions for inundation for different species and species mixtures is crucial to predictions of vegetation change, and subsequent wetland loss. ]\n","115\n","iteracion 116\n","[ Research and management of plastic pollution in coastal environments of China ]\n","116\n","[ Highlights Microplastic increasingly being detected in Chinese coastal environments.

Coastal erosion started from the 1970’s and became a very serious problem at 1990’s. The dramatic decrease of sediment supplies from rivers caused rapid erosion at the delta and estuary areas, especially in the abandoned Yellow River Delta. Most sandy coasts along the Peninsula were eroded due to lack of sand supply and interruption of alongshore sediment drift, sand dredging from the beach or the offshore area caused serious erosion during short time. Sea-level rise causes slow but constant shoreline retreats and became a more serious threat. Different types of hard solutions for coastal protection against erosion were used in Shandong. Seawalls are most widely used, especially at the Yellow River Delta and city center waterfront. Groynes, jetties and breakwater are used on the north and east sandy coast of the Peninsula. Hard approaches are effective to protect the coast erosion but not change the erosion causes and led secondary impact on the coast. Soft engineering solution or the combined solutions are taken into acts. Beach nourishment is mostly considered as the better soft solution, especially to those tourists attracting sandy beaches along the Shandong coast.

Wetland losses also reduce the primary production by plants that would otherwise bury carbon in the future. More than 50% of these ecosystems have been lost globally over the last half century, with this number approaching 58% in China. The negotiation of international accords such as the Paris Climate Agreement rely on the accurate assessment of ecosystem-held carbon quantities. Our objective was to provide the first national scale survey of coastal wetland-based carbon in China. The average soil organic carbon stock (Mg SOC ha −1 ) across all three types of ecosystems was 236.91, with an average of 344.67 for mangroves , 175.14 for seagrass , and 134.37 for salt marshes. The SOC stock was greatest at 30–60 cm of depth in the case of mangroves, as opposed to 0–20 cm of depth for salt marshes. In terms of the carbon content of the standing aboveground and belowground biomass (Mg C ha −1 ), mangroves contained by far the most with an average of 253.98 and 83.96, respectively. Carbon burial rates, or the annual flux of SOC into the soil column (Mg C ha −1 yr −1 ), were 2.26 ± 0.39 for mangroves, 1.38 ± 0.38 for seagrass, and 2.18 ± 0.24 for salt marshes. Through our work, we found a total of 48.12–123.95 Tg of C in China's coastal wetlands (down to 1 m of soil column depth), with an annual burial of 0.84 Tg yr −1 . We estimate the average annual emissions of CO 2 to be on the order of 6.83 Tg CO 2 yr −1 , due to ongoing and extensive wetland loss and conversion. ]\n","124\n","iteracion 125\n","[ Use of ecosystems in coastal erosion management ]\n","125\n","[ Highlights A high percentage of world coastlines experience serious coastal erosion issues. Erosion affects many activities related to economic growth. Current climate change conditions demand adequate coastal erosion management strategies. The coastal erosion management using ecosystems is cost-effective and sustainable. The success of this strategy will depend on the determination of realistic operational objectives and indicators. , With a global increase in coastal development, together with increasing storminess and continuing sea level rise , coastal erosion has become a serious problem along a significant percentage of coastlines of many countries. Coastal erosion and shoreline management plans are often implemented on an action-reaction and post-disaster basis, resulting in installation of hard engineering structures, such as, groins, seawalls, revetments , gabions and breakwaters. These hard stabilization structures usually alter the natural environment of the coast, producing negative impacts. They do little to work with nature, and sustainability is a currently a critical issue. Under present and future environmental conditions, the world requires smarter coastal protection strategies that are adaptable, sustainable, multi-functional and economically viable to help solve immediate and predicted coastal erosion problems. An ecosystem-based approach based on the creation and restoration of coastal ecosystems , such as wetlands (e.g. mangroves), biogenic reef structures (e.g. corals, oysters, and mussels), seagrass beds and dune vegetation can offer optimal natural alternatives to help solve coastal erosion. Coastal ecosystems have some capacity for self-repair and recovery, and can provide significant advantages over traditional hard engineering approaches against coastal erosion. Also, they play a vital role in reducing the susceptibility of coastal communities to hazards through their multiple roles in processes, including sediment capture, system roughness and thus attenuation of wave energy. This paper seeks to undertake a general review of adaptation and protection measures against coastal erosion issues, based on incorporation of ecology and ecosystem services into coastal erosion management strategies. ]\n","125\n","iteracion 126\n","[ Defining coastal squeeze: A discussion ]\n","126\n","[ Highlights Coastal squeeze is a common term in coastal management although its definition varies and this can create confusion.

This brief discussion paper explains how the usage of the term has evolved since its origins and how imprecise definitions have led to confusion when discussing changes in coastal habitat extent.

We compile and discuss studies (1998–2018) of CB sources for coastal environments, composition/degradability, quantification on beaches, toxicity to aquatic organisms and existing strategies to abate the problem. The literature shows that despite the growing interest in marine litter, this specific issue remains little studied and information is limited in time and space.

There area wide variety of approaches to classification; for example, CB are considered plastic in 19% of studies and placed in an isolated category in another 16%. It was possible to identify the main sources of CB in coastal environments and access to the marine biota . In conclusion, we list and discuss proposals for reducing smoking, littering and marine pollution as a contribution to reduce the problems caused by CB in coastal and marine environments.

In this paper we review the most appropriate determination methods for those metal species, addressing particularly in situ speciation and preconcentration . Focus is on DGT-ICPMS, which is a technique that meets these criteria very well. In coastal environments, DGT probes are widely used for metal pollution monitoring, but in open ocean a carrier such as a glider, is required.

Knowledge clusters and evidence gaps can be viewed in an evidence heatmap. We identify a lack of comparative, quantitative studies suggesting the need for future research to include comparators . , Background Conservation activities and natural resource management interventions have often aimed to tackle the dual challenge of improving nature conservation and human well-being. However, there is concern over the extent to which this dual goal has been achieved, and an increasing recognition of trade-offs and synergies within and between aspects of each of the goals. The amount and scope of the available evidence on the success of conservation and management interventions in both arenas has lacked documentation, for a number of reasons, including limited resources for monitoring and evaluation and the difficulty in bringing together a disparate evidence base. This systematic map focuses on the interaction between marine conservation management and the health and well-being of coastal communities in South East Asia. Method We searched bibliographic databases to find published literature, and identified grey literature through institutional and organisational website searches and key stakeholders. Eligibility criteria were applied in two stages, title and abstract and full text, with consistency checks. We extracted meta - data on the design and characteristics of each study, from which we produced an interactive database and map, and a narrative summary. Results We assessed 42,894 records at title and abstract from the main searches. 1,331 articles were assessed at full text (30 articles were not retrievable). 287 articles (281 studies) were included in the systematic map. Most studies were peer-reviewed publications (90%), and from the Philippines and Indonesia (72%). 31% of studies were solely qualitative, 45% were solely quantitative and 24% included both qualitative and quantitative research. Only 24% (31/127) of quantitative studies included a comparator. We identified knowledge clusters where studies investigated the links between the marine conservation interventions: Site Protection , Economic or Livelihood Incentives or Alternatives , or Habitat Management , and the human health and well-being outcomes: Economic Living Standards, Governance and Empowerment , or Social Relations . In addition, qualitative research clusters were identified exploring the links between the intervention Habitat Management , and the outcome Governance and Empowerment , and between the intervention Economic or Livelihood Incentives or Alternatives , and the outcomes of Governance and Empowerment , and Social Relations . We identified major knowledge gaps in evidence for the effect of marine conservation interventions on the outcomes Freedom of Choice and Action, Security and Safety, Subjective Well-being, Health , and Culture and Spirituality . There was a lack of studies involving Education, Awareness and Activism interventions that reported any human health and well-being outcomes. Conclusion We present the first updatable, interrogable and comprehensive evidence map on this topic for South East Asia.

First, some fundamental differences in the hydrodynamics of the coastal ocean, such as the large surface elevation variation compared to the mean water depth, are contrasted against large scale ocean dynamics. Then the hydrodynamic equations as they are used in coastal ocean models as well as in large scale ocean models are presented, including parameterisations for turbulent transports. As steps towards discretisation, coordinate transformations and spatial discretisations based on a finite-volume approach are discussed with focus on the specific requirements for coastal ocean models. As in large scale ocean models, splitting of internal and external modes is essential also for coastal ocean models, but specific care is needed when drying &amp; flooding of intertidal flats is included. As one obvious characteristic of coastal ocean models, open boundaries occur and need to be treated in a way that correct model forcing from outside is transmitted to the model domain without reflecting waves from the inside.

Zanzibar coasts are confronted with pressures from population increase, urbanization and emerging coastal activities. The environment state of Zanzibar coasts is altered and the consequences are affecting its socio-ecological systems. Several legislative measures consider the coastal zone in Zanzibar but the reality shows a failure of ad hoc management. A shift for the better may be taking place and increasing interest toward integrated coastal and marine spatial planning. , The coastal zone of Zanzibar, Tanzania, is culturally, socially, economically, and ecologically unique but there is a lack of baseline information about its state characteristics as a whole. This paper provides a holistic assessment of the environmental and socio-economic settings of the Zanzibar coastal zone with its unusual physiographic characteristics and key habitats such as coral reefs, mangroves , and seagrass meadows . The human livelihood of Zanzibar is unmistakably coastal with its many cultural adaptations but the most recent decades have shown drastic changes in the prevailing seaborne and coastal activities. This development has not been without disputes among the different interest groups. The driver-pressure-state-impact-response approach allows to scrutinize the socio-ecological system circles of the Zanzibar coastal zone. Systematically, the approach provides interlink of the drivers and with their impacts on the socio-economic systems and the appropriate responses necessary to combat the impacts. The main drivers identified to be the population increase, urbanization with settlement expansion, and the rapid expansion of the shore-dwelling tourism with its associated infrastructures. These factors are adversely impacting the coastal and marine nature and the traditional socio-economic systems. The Zanzibar government has put forward several initiatives to protect the health of the coastal ecosystems and the endurance of the traditional cultures. The effective implementation of measures, for example, the Zanzibar Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning as part of the National Land Use Plan , have not yet been sufficient to restore the situation. However, there are also signs of commitment being fostered and an improvement in the know-how for making changes.

These trends create a strong and sustained demand for land reclamation and infrastructure protection in coastal areas, requiring engineered coastal defence structures such as sea walls. Here, we review the nature of ecological impacts of coastal structures on intertidal ecosystems, seek to understand the extent to which ecological engineering can mitigate these impacts, and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation as a tool to contribute to conservation of intertidal habitats. By so doing, we identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future research. Coastal structures alter important physical, chemical and biological processes of intertidal habitats, and strongly impact community structure, inter-habitat linkages and ecosystem services while also driving habitat loss. Such impacts occur diffusely across localised sites but scale to significant regional and global levels. Recent advances in ecological engineering have focused on developing habitat complexity on coastal structures to increase biodiversity. ‘Soft’ engineering options maximise habitat complexity through inclusion of natural materials, species and processes, while simultaneously delivering engineering objectives such as coastal protection. Soft options additionally sustain multiple services, providing greater economic benefits for society, and resilience to climatic change. Currently however, a lack of inclusion and economic undervaluation of intertidal ecosystem services may undermine best practice in coastline management. Importantly, reviewed evidence shows mitigation and even restoration do not support intertidal communities or processes equivalent to pre-disturbance conditions. Crucially, an absence of comprehensive empirical baseline biodiversity data, or data comprising additional ecological parameters such as ecosystem functions and services, prohibits quantification of absolute and relative magnitudes of ecological impacts due to coastal structures or effectiveness of mitigation interventions. This knowledge deficit restricts evaluation of the potential of ecological engineering to contribute to conservation policies for intertidal habitats. To improve mitigation design and effectiveness, a greater focus on in-situ research is needed, requiring stronger and timely collaboration between government agencies, construction partners and research scientists. ]\n","135\n","iteracion 136\n","[ Non-indigenous species in marine and coastal habitats of the South China Sea ]\n","136\n","[ Highlights We reviewed the literature and all other information about non-indigenous species in the South China Sea.

A commonly referenced aquatic organism, mollusks represent a group of major interest in toxicological studies. Both gastropods and bivalves have external mineral shells that protects their soft tissue from predation and desiccation. These structures are composed of an organic matrix and an inorganic matrix, both of which are affected by environmental changes, including exposure to hazardous chemicals. This literature review evaluates studies that propose mollusk shell alterations as biomarkers of aquatic system quality. The studies included herein show that changes to natural variables such as salinity , temperature, food availability, hydrodynamics, desiccation, predatory pressure, and substrate type may influence the form, structure, and composition of mollusk shells. However, in the spatial and temporal studies performed in coastal waters around the world, shells of organisms sampled from multi-impacted areas were found to differ in the form and composition of both organic and inorganic matrices relative to shells from less contaminated areas. Though these findings are useful, the toxicological studies were often performed in the field and were not able to attribute shell alterations to a specific molecule. It is known that the organic matrix of shells regulates the biomineralization process; proteomic analyses of shells may therefore elucidate how different contaminants affect shell biomineralization. Further research using approaches that allow a clearer distinction between shell alterations caused by natural variations and those caused by anthropogenic influence, as well as studies to identify which molecule is responsible for such alterations or to determine the ecological implications of shell alterations, are needed before any responses can be applied universally. ]\n","137\n","iteracion 138\n","[ Morphogenetic modelling of coastal and estuarine evolution ]\n","138\n","[ Environmental pressures from climate change and anthropogenic activities have increased the need for quantitative morphogenetic models of coasts and estuaries .

Based on a review of most of the existing morphogenetic models applicable on open oceanic coasts and in estuaries , we use the Exner equations to clarify the potential of individual models. Fundamental coastal and estuarine behaviours, and cautions required when implementing the models, are also discussed on the basis of the Exner equations. Major differences between and difficulties with these models are in the derivation and computation of vertical and horizontal sediment fluxes; these can be even more complicated in estuaries than on open coasts because it is more important to consider estuarine systems in three dimensions and to account for a wider range of grain sizes. In addition, estuaries typically experience more complex interplay between physical and ecological processes as well as connections with both hinterland and the open coast. Tackling these difficulties requires more observational data to derive increasingly reliable parameterizations of sediment fluxes. Future model development and application across a range of spatial-temporal scales should be based on the Exner equations, modified to suit local coastal and estuarine settings, and incorporating natural complexities and hierarchical landform features. ]\n","138\n","iteracion 139\n","[ Recommended priorities for research on ecological impacts of ocean and coastal acidification in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic ]\n","139\n","[ The estuaries and continental shelf system of the United States Mid-Atlantic are subject to ocean acidification driven by atmospheric CO 2 , and coastal acidification caused by nearshore and land-sea interactions that include biological, chemical, and physical processes.

When regional threshold levels were used, however, the probable effect for the ∑ 16-PAHs measured was high, ranging from 5.8 to 6.1%. The few studies reporting biological responses showed that hydrocarbons from anthropogenic sources can induce adverse effects on marine organisms even at low to moderate levels. As the region has recently received a considerable quantity of crude oil, studies should be prioritised for a more precise assessment of the impact of this oil spill. ]\n","143\n","iteracion 144\n","[ Microplastics in Mediterranean coastal area: toxicity and impact for the environment and human health ]\n","144\n","[ Highlights Microplastics (MPLs) are ubiquitous in the Mediterranean Sea Particularly high levels of MPLs were reported in the eastern area MPLs research shortcomings are the lack of analytical methods and standardization , The so-called marine litter, and in particular microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs), are ubiquitously distributed and recognised as an emerging risk for the environment and human health. It is known that marine environments are one of the most impacted areas and among them; coastal zones are the most contaminated ones. They are subjected to population pressure, tourism, harbours, desalination plants, marine traffic and fish farms. This review is focused on the Mediterranean Sea, currently considered one hot spot of microplastics pollution in the world, as a consequence of the high number of plastic marine litter generating activities and its characteristic morphology of semi-enclosed sea. MPs and NPs have been detected not only in surface water and water columns but also in sediments, deep seafloor, and biota including fish and seafood for human consumption. Because of this, different European legislation initiatives have been launched during the last years in order to prevent MPs and NPs contamination and to face derived problems. Finally, this review summarises the main problems and shortcomings associated to MPs and NPs analyses such as their identification and quantification or the necessity of standardised protocols. ]\n","144\n","iteracion 145\n","[ Coastal lagoons and rising sea level: A review ]\n","145\n","[ Sea-level rise (SLR) poses a particularly ominous threat to human habitations and infrastructure in the coastal zone because 10% of the world's population lives in low-lying coastal regions within 10 m elevation of present sea level. There has been much discussion about projected (and the sources of projection) vs. measured SLR rates. Which rates should coastal scientists and managers apply in their studies, and what is the degree of confidence of such forecasts, are still open questions. This paper reviews the patterns and effects of relative SLR (RSLR) in coastal lagoons . Three main components are presented in the review: (a) a summary of the main approaches used in predicting medium- to long-term trends in RSLR, (b) a summary of the main evolutionary trends of coastal lagoons and the tools used to examine such trends, and (c) an identification of future research needs. The review reveals that the major source of uncertainty is how and when RSLR will manifest itself at different spatio-temporal scales in coastal lagoon systems, and how its effects can be mitigated. Most of the studies reviewed herein articulate a natural ‘defence’ mechanism of barriers in coastal lagoons by landward barrier retreat through continuous migration, and a gradual change in basin hypsometry during the retreat process. So far, only a relatively small number of detailed studies have integrated and quantified human impacts and coastal lagoon evolution induced by RSLR. We conclude that much more research about adaptation measures is needed, taking into consideration not only the physical and ecological systems but also social, cultural, and economic impacts. Future challenges include a downscaling of SLR approaches from the global level to regional and local levels, with a detailed application of coastal evolution prediction to individual coastal lagoon systems. ]\n","145\n","iteracion 146\n","[ Sustainable coastal ecosystem management – An evolving paradigm and its application to Caribbean SIDS ]\n","146\n","[ Highlights The most recent comprehensive review of literature on this topic.

However, the nature-society relationship is highly dynamic and complex and requires a framework which can accommodate options. In coastal systems, poor resource management is among the main causes of its degradation. As such, impacts arising from climate change, including sea-level rise, has forced an increase in the demand for sustainable coastal ecosystem science to inform management decisions. The realization of current and future sustainability objectives depends on the development and implementation of coherent strategies on managing dynamic ecosystems for retaining their ability to undergo disturbance, while maintaining their services, functions and control mechanisms. This paper provides a review of the basic assumptions, typical frameworks and methodologies that are adopted for (i) sustainability and sustainable management, (ii) ecosystem services and ecosystem management and (iii) coastal ecosystem management applications in Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

Levels of uncertainty in the hazards could be better communicated. Risk management provides a way to incorporate uncertainty more transparently. , Determination of coastal hazard lines is a key task for coastal engineers worldwide. While current practice differs from country to country and even within countries, in many coastal hazard assessments three main components of coastline recession are taken into account: episodic recession due to storm erosion, long term recession due to an imbalance in sediment transport , and recession due to sea-level rise. In Australia, the state of New South Wales has a well-established procedure for the definition of coastal hazards that has evolved since the 1970's. Accepted practice in NSW is intentionally conservative, due to uncertainties and a limited understanding of physical processes. This article (i) provides an historical perspective on the development of the established methodology; (ii) discusses the various components of coastal hazard considered, and (iii) examines the way in which these components can be combined. Suggestions are subsequently provided for a way forward that better suits emerging risk-based coastal management/planning frameworks.

Within the range of vector-borne diseases, dengue is more linked with global climatic pattern variation. Scientific observation brings strong evidence with 98% of the inhabitants interviewed living in Southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh since childhood confirming that the sea level is rising, with more frequent tidal inundation. , This article attempts to analyze the main impacts of climate change on public health starting with global and going through local by analyzing coastal communities in the area of influence of Sundarbans, located in southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh. In dealing with paramount health problems caused by climate change, we discuss what are the major challenges faced by different actors. From the opinion of globalization and world system theory it will be argued that developing countries are facing major defiance in terms of mitigation and adaptation, including human health problems.

Globally, a number of resilience assessment methodologies have been developed and implemented by a variety of entities, including national and local organizations, donor agencies, and academic researchers. In Bangladesh, although a number of resilience studies have been conducted, it has never been determined whether these assessments rightfully addressed conceptual understanding, methodological approaches, and disciplinary underpinnings, and maintained compliance with on-going research communications standards. To unpack this gap, we systematically reviewed 38 articles to characterize how the resilience to climate change, of coastal communities in Bangladesh, is being assessed. To operationalize the study, we have presented a brief overview of the assessment tools and then applied an analytical framework containing six criteria: comprehensiveness of dimensions, scalar relationships, temporal dynamism, addressing uncertainties of climate change by modeling and scenario-making, participatory approaches, and action plans. The overview analysis shows diverse traditions of methodological underpinnings, and reveals authors' often incomplete conceptual understandings of resilience. Results of the review analysis reveal extensive inadequacy regarding multiple dimensionality, scalar and temporal scales, and more importantly, addressing the uncertainty of climate change. In relation to comprehensiveness, current literature has failed to consistently comply with global research communication in regard to the criteria of institutional and infrastructural dimensions. More attention needs to be placed on temporal and scalar dynamics. Most importantly, the uncertainty issue is virtually overlooked in the literature, and iterative processes and the development of alternate states of planning through scenario analysis are also critical, for risk reduction and adaptation to climate-change impacts.

It was found that, despite the obvious advantages in reporting the state of the coast using geoindicators, their generalized adoption seems to be stalled and is limited to a few management settings and particular projects. The existence of a myriad of coastal geoindicators, that frequently are poorly defined, is identified as the major difficulty in their widespread use. The present work aims to contribute towards the establishment of a common framework for coastal geoindicators, focusing on sandy coastal environments. The main objective of the compilation and definition of the indicators herein presented is to simplify and clarify their designations, and objectively present the measurement and reporting criteria aiming at a consensus-based approach. Sixteen coastal geoindicators are identified as relevant for the description of the state of beach, coastal dunes , and coastal barrier environments. This effort contributes to the adoption of coastal geoindicators as an effective communication tool leading to a more standardized report on the state of the coastal zone. ]\n","154\n","iteracion 155\n","[ Improving management of future coastal development in Qatar through ecosystem-based management approaches ]\n","155\n","[ Highlights Qatar's coastline is a mosaic of unique yet vulnerable interconnected habitats.

Ecosystem-based approaches offer Qatar an opportunity for more holistic management. , The coastline of Qatar is a rich mosaic of productive and diverse ecosystems including mangrove forests, intertidal mudflats (sabkha), seagrass beds , and coral reefs. These ecologically interconnected ecosystems contain a substantial proportion of Qatar's total biodiversity, and support an estimated 97% of the &gt;US$ 67 million in annual commercial fisheries , the highest value resource sector after petroleum. The extreme environmental conditions that characterize Qatar has led to fauna that are robust compared with other regions, but makes them highly sensitive to further pressure from anthropogenic stress. These vulnerable ecosystems have come under increasing pressure in recent decades as a result of dramatic expansion of coastal development, and threats to these ecosystems are likely to accelerate in the coming years as Qatar's economy and population continue to grow. Although environmental regulation had historically lagged behind the rapid pace of development, in recent years Qatar's leadership has aggressively expanded environmental management as a result of the growing awareness of the importance of coastal ecosystems . While these improvements are encouraging, management remains challenged by its current sectorial, project-driven focus. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) offers an opportunity to overcome these challenges by integrating impacts from across all major activities in multiple sectors and considering their cumulative effects on ecosystem services and products.

In the Baltic Sea, shallow productive habitats in the coastal zone such as wetlands , vegetated flads/lagoons and sheltered bays as well as more exposed rocky and sandy areas are utilized by fish across many life history stages including spawning, juvenile development, feeding and migration. Although there is general consensus about the critical importance of these essential fish habitats (EFH) for fish production along the coast, direct quantitative evidence for their specific roles in population growth and maintenance is still scarce. Nevertheless, for some coastal species, indirect evidence exists, and in many cases, sufficient data are also available to carry out further quantitative analyses. As coastal EFH in the Baltic Sea are often found in areas that are highly utilized and valued by humans, they are subjected to many different pressures. While cumulative pressures, such as eutrophication , coastal construction and development, climate change, invasive species and fisheries, impact fish in coastal areas, the conservation coverage for EFH in these areas remains poor. This is mainly due to the fact that historically, fisheries management and nature conservation are not integrated neither in research nor in management in Baltic Sea countries. Setting joint objectives for fisheries management and nature conservation would hence be pivotal for improved protection of EFH in the Baltic Sea. To properly inform management, improvements in the development of monitoring strategies and mapping methodology for EFH are also needed. Stronger international cooperation between Baltic Sea states will facilitate improved management outcomes across ecologically arbitrary boundaries. This is especially important for successful implementation of international agreements and legislative directives such as the Baltic Sea Action Plan, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Habitats Directive, and the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive, but also for improving the communication of information related to coastal EFH among researchers, stakeholders, managers and decision makers. In this paper, efforts are made to characterize coastal EFH in the Baltic Sea, their importance and the threats/pressures they face, as well as their current conservation status, while highlighting knowledge gaps and outlining perspectives for future work in an ecosystem-based management framework. ]\n","156\n","iteracion 157\n","[ Policies in coastal wetlands: Key challenges ]\n","157\n","[ Highlights Policies for development facilitate the occupation of zones with coastal wetlands. Environmental policies address sustainability through territorial planning. Property regimes contradict the spatial boundaries of environmental policies. Policies reduce or improve livelihoods in coastal wetlands. Adaptation means collaboration, feedbacks, flexible institutions, viable objectives and reliable assessments. , The role of public policies in protecting coastal wetlands is gaining in prominence. The goal of this paper is to review the research themes and the key challenges of coastal wetlands policies. We found 259 papers that cover five research themes: development and impacts, territory, local population, governance, and management. Half of the papers are study cases from North America, and South and Southeast Asia. Regional patterns show that researchers in North America and West Europe focus on the themes of governance and management, while scientists in Latin America, Asia and Africa concentrate their efforts on development and impacts and local population. The paper concludes that development policies are affecting coastal wetlands by promoting or allowing urban and economic activities to grow out of control; territorial planning is mismatched with ecological dynamics and influenced by economic interests; the government must build adaptation and a collaborative, multilevel, and decentralized system to achieve the integration of local population in decision-making. Adaptation in the governance improves conservation, restoration, mitigation and compensation, which are significant factors considering the disastrous effects of climate change. ]\n","157\n","iteracion 158\n","[ Occurrence and speciation of arsenic and mercury in alluvial and coastal sediments ]\n","158\n","[ Highlights Sediments are sink or secondary source of arsenic (As) and mercury (Hg).

From these databases, only 193 are applicable in mapping exercises at the European level. The most commonly mapped variables are related to environmental variables. These databases concern mainly the mapping of regulation services and the monitoring of GES descriptors 1, 5 and 7. , Assessing the stocks and flows of ecosystem services valued by society is crucial to ensure the sustainable management of marine ecosystems, as required by the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD; EC, 2008). The mapping of these ecosystem services enhances the flow of information from researchers to practitioners, contributing to a better management of ecosystem services. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, a screening and evaluation of available open source spatial databases was conducted to assess their usefulness to map European coastal and marine ecosystem services. Second, these spatial databases were classified according to the DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, Status, Impacts, Responses) framework and the MSFD descriptors to assess how this information can inform decision-makers. The supply of explicit spatial information was used as main screening criteria and allowed to identify 581 existing databases. These databases were then categorised according to a set of criteria (including data collection methods and updating frequency) related with their usefulness to be applied to map ecosystem services. The databases that did not meet the selected criteria (e.g. no explicit spatial information) were discarded. This process allowed to identify 329 spatial databases useful for coastal and marine ecosystem services mapping in Europe. The databases were then distinguished based on the ability to work the data on a GIS software, identifying 193 databases that allowed further analysis (hereafter applicable), and 136 databases that do not allow the extraction of data (hereafter non-applicable). The applicable spatial databases were further linked to the i) CICES framework for ecosystem services classification, ii) DPSIR framework and iii) descriptors considered in the MSFD. The obtained results showed that 42% of the spatial databases can be useful to map regulation services, followed by provision (33%) and cultural (21%) services. Considering the DPSIR framework, more than half can be used as proxies to evaluate coastal and marine ecosystems status (66%), followed by proxies of pressures (18%), drivers (8%), responses (4%), and finally impacts (4%). The available databases represent in a better way MSFD descriptors related to Hydrogeological conditions (D7), Eutrophication (D5), and Biodiversity (D1), being the non-indigenous species (D2) and contaminants in seafood (D9) descriptors somehow underrepresented. The obtained findings highlight the spatial open data limitations and challenges when mapping coastal and marine ecosystem services and contribute to the identification of spatial data gaps and opportunities when aiming for the sustainable management of marine ecosystems. ]\n","160\n","iteracion 161\n","[ Boston Harbor, Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Transformation from ‘the harbor of shame’ to a vibrant coastal resource ]\n","161\n","[ Highlights Boston Harbor receives millions of visitors per year, in part to enjoy its revitalized waterfront.

There is growing interest in the U.S., as well as around the world, to use natural infrastructure to help coastal communities become more resilient to extreme events and reduce the risk of coastal flooding. Here we highlight strengths and weaknesses of the coastal protection benefits provided by built infrastructure, natural ecosystems, and the innovative opportunities to combine the two into hybrid approaches for coastal protection. We also examine some case studies where hybrid approaches are being implemented to improve coastal resilience as well as some of the policy challenges that can make implementation of these approaches more difficult. The case studies we examine are largely in the U.S. but also include a couple of international examples as well. Based on this analysis, we conclude that coastal communities and other decision makers need better information in order to incorporate ecosystem protection and restoration into coastal resilience planning efforts. As additional projects are developed, it is important to capitalize on every opportunity to learn more about the cost of natural and hybrid infrastructure projects, the value of the storm and erosion protection benefits provided, and the full suite of co-benefits provided by healthy coastal ecosystems. We highlight top priorities for research, investment in, and application of natural and hybrid approaches. These data are critical to facilitate adoption of these approaches in planning and decision-making at all levels to enhance the resilience of our coasts. ]\n","166\n","iteracion 167\n","[ On the origins and significance of Pleistocene coastal resource use in southern Africa with particular reference to shellfish gathering ]\n","167\n","[ Highlights South African origins and significance of Pleistocene coastal resources are debated. Shellfish collection is unique to this adaptation and is explored cross-culturally. Methodology to identify systematic use of coastal resources is critically assessed. Holocene coastal record is examined in detail as a source of hypothesis testing. Models and fieldwork must consider these for sound explanations on empirical basis. , The search for human origins in Africa has partly narrowed down to probing into the origins of the modern human lineage and the identification of a set of behaviours that characterises it. Much research effort is now dedicated to coastal southern African Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites. This record is still relatively small compared with the Middle Palaeolithic of Europe, and much of the original sites have been lost due to erosional sea level changes tied to glacial to interglacial cycles. However, more explicit conceptual frameworks for understanding coastal adaptation and its evolutionary role in this region have recently been put forward. Partly stimulated by human nutrition studies, coastal resources, especially shellfish, have acquired an unchecked high status in research agendas. Limited local ethnography on coastal foragers and a lack formalised methodologies for inter-site comparison on coastal resource procurement are evident. In this paper, aspects unique to coastal adaptation with particular reference to shellfish collection are explored. Models on the origin and evolution of coastal adaptations must consider cross-cultural ethnographic studies, move away from the simplistic use of shell densities for evaluating procurement intensity and use the much richer Later Stone Age record as a profitable source for testing hypotheses. ]\n","167\n","iteracion 168\n","[ Current status of coastal wetlands in China: Degradation, restoration, and future management ]\n","168\n","[ Highlights Coastal wetlands area accounts for 11% of the total wetlands area in China, which ranks the 1st in Asia.

Federal programs have failed in part by not including projected rates of sea-level and erosion. State/local regulations have failed to protect beaches/dunes due to legal flaws (e.g., variances). Lack of consistent political foresight, will, and enforcement is the primary reason regulations fail. , This perspective examines case examples, primarily from the U. S. Carolinas and Alabama, that illustrate some of the flaws of four federal programs of the last 50 years (National Flood Insurance Program, U. S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act, Coastal Area Management Act, Stafford Disaster Relief Act), as well as general reasons for state and local regulation failures. The latter include: variances that undercut the regulatory intent by the tyranny of small decisions, emergency dispensations, and compensatory mitigation; allowances for ‘temporary’ shore-hardening structures that become permanent; establishing control lines that are not adjusted to shifting shorelines ; over-simplifying (one-size-fits-all) and misapplying (importing inappropriate strategies) regulations; conflicting jurisdictional boundaries; and the political instability of regulatory laws. Political-legislative realm failures include: 1) generalized laws do not match the complexity of coasts; 2) legislators lack the foresight to provide funding for regulatory monitoring/enforcement/penalties; 3) legislative bodies lack continuity of visions or goals for the future (e.g., overturn or weaken prior regulatory legislation); and 4) politicians are subject to conflicts of interest (e.g., affluent coastal land owners; pro-development lobbies). The political-legislative disconnect from the reality of Nature, and failure to use longer-term projections of erosion rates , sediment supply, and effects of sea-level rise, are the most frequent culprits in regulatory failure. New starting points for sound regulatory coastal management are better-informed politicians with the will to enact laws based on science that reflect natural variability, and laws that are unflawed by variances or over simplification. Regulations need to have continuity, proper funding, and enforcement. ]\n","170\n","iteracion 171\n","[ Complex sedimentology and palaeohabitats of Holocene coastal deserts, their topographic controls, and analogues for the mid-Cretaceous of northern Iberia ]\n","171\n","[ Desert coasts in plate margins contain one of the most variable sedimentary records in terms of facies and stacking patterns. Reliefs in these basins together with massif palaeogeography and palaeotopography strongly control the spatial distribution of facies belts and complex lateral facies changes between very different coeval sub-environments, leading to mixtures of sedimentary particles with variable composition. Palaeotopography and palaeogeography also control the distribution of flora palaeohabitats in the desert basins depending on the spatial distribution of fresh water, the basin geometry, the topographic variability and associated phreatic level, as well as the effective distance from highlands to the coast. The Albian desert basin that developed in northern Iberia presents similarities with the geomorphology of modern Oman, UAE and Eritrea desert coasts. In both systems (Cretaceous and Holocene) the distance between highlands and arid coastline determines the occurrence of extensive aeolian sand seas (e.g. wide desert basin where distance between the highlands and the coastline increases) or the development of wadi-fed alluvial fans that reach directly the desert coast (e.g. narrow desert basin) leading to a variety of clastic and mixed carbonate facies. Due to prevailing arid conditions, vegetation is mainly restricted to highlands and water-conditioned lowland environments such as wadis, (tidal) coastal marshes and lagoons . Depending on sea influence and water availability, Cretaceous vegetation in Iberia were characterized by montane communities including arboreal/shrubby gymnosperms (mainly conifers) and lowland communities composed by a patchy mixture of ferns, Cupressaceae (cypress family), Cheirolepidiaceae and early angiosperms and/or costal woodlands incorporating Araucariaceae (monkey puzzle tree family).

Coastal adaptation that incorporates the evaluation of long-term options is in its infancy in Australia. The framing of risk and uncertainty is critical to the evaluation outcomes. Assumptions used in current practice are too simplistic for the evaluation timeframes. Current practice should use more non-probabilistic scenarios to support evaluations. , Rising sea levels have the potential to alter coastal flooding regimes around the world and local governments are beginning to consider how to manage uncertain coastal change. In doing so, there is increasing recognition that such change is deeply uncertain and unable to be reliably described with probabilities or a small number of scenarios. Characteristics of methodologies applied in Australian practice to evaluate long-term coastal adaptation options are reviewed and benchmarked against two state-of-the-art international methods suited for conditions of uncertainty (Robust Decision Making and Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways). Seven out of the ten Australian case studies assumed the uncertain parameters, such as sea level rise , could be described deterministically or stochastically when identifying risk and evaluating adaptation options across multi-decadal periods. This basis is not considered sophisticated enough for long-term decision-making, implying that Australian practice needs to increase the use of scenarios to explore a much larger uncertainty space when assessing the performance of adaptation options. Two Australian case studies mapped flexible adaptation pathways to manage uncertainty, and there remains an opportunity to incorporate quantitative methodologies to support the identification of risk thresholds. The contextual framing of risk, including the approach taken to identify risk (top-down or bottom-up) and treatment of uncertain parameters, were found to be fundamental characteristics that influenced the methodology selected to evaluate adaptation options. The small sample of case studies available suggests that long-term coastal adaptation in Australian is in its infancy and there is a timely opportunity to guide local government towards robust methodologies for developing long-term coastal adaptation plans. ]\n","173\n","iteracion 174\n","[ Managing hydrological infrastructure assets for improved flood control in coastal mega-cities of developing nations ]\n","174\n","[ Every year, coastal mega-cities situated in developing nations suffer severe losses associated with flood hazards.

Integrating these datasets can provide more reliable coastal information. This paper presents a novel technique for coastal mapping from an airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral image and a light detection and ranging (LIDAR)-based digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM was used to detect and create a vector layer for building polygons. Subsequently, building pixels were removed from the AVIRIS image and the image was classified with a supervised classifier to discriminate road and water pixels. Two vector layers for the road network and the shoreline segments were vectorized from road pixels and water-body border pixels using several image-processing algorithms. The geometric accuracy and completeness of the results were evaluated. The average positional accuracies for the building, road network, and shoreline layers were 2.3, 5.7, and 7.2 m, respectively. The detection rates of the three layers were 93.2%, 91.3%, and 95.2%, respectively. Results confirmed that utilizing laser ranging data to detect and remove buildings from optical images before the classification process enhances the outcomes of this process. Consequently, integrating laser and optical data provides high-quality and more reliable coastal geospatial information. ]\n","175\n","iteracion 176\n","[ Direct plant–plant facilitation in coastal wetlands: A review ]\n","176\n","[ Coastal wetlands provide important ecosystem services to humanity, but human activity and climate change are rapidly degrading these ecosystems.

Migrations of amber stones in the sea and their massive washing ashore have been monitored by Baltic citizens for ages. Based on the collected information, we present the hypothesis on the behaviour of microplastic particles in sea coastal zone. Fresh-to-strong winds generate surface waves, currents and roll-structures, whose joint effect washes ashore from the underwater slope both amber stones and plastics – and carries them back to the sea in a few days. Analysis of underlying hydrophysical processes suggests that sea coastal zone under stormy winds plays a role of a mill for plastics, and negatively buoyant pieces seem to repeatedly migrate between beaches and underwater slopes until they are broken into small enough fragments that can be transported by currents to deeper areas and deposited out of reach of stormy waves. Direct observations on microplastics migrations are urged to prove the hypothesis. ]\n","179\n","iteracion 180\n","[ The consequences of doing nothing: The effects of seawater flooding on coastal zones ]\n","180\n","[ Highlights Understanding of seawater flooding on terrestrial flora and fauna is limited. Little attention has been given to the effects of flooding on business activity. Coastal habitats are quite resilient to seawater flooding. Businesses are poorly prepared for coastal flooding. An ecological approach to business management could increase resilience. , Sea level rise and an increased frequency and severity of storm surge events due to climate change are likely to increase the susceptibility of low lying coastal areas to seawater flooding. An integral part of any coastal management strategy throughout European countries is the “do nothing” scenario; this is the benchmark against which putative intervention strategies are evaluated. While the prime concern of a flood defense scheme appraisal often focuses on the sustained financial “benefits” of an intervention, intrinsic to a complete multicriteria analysis is a comprehensive evaluation of the ecological and social consequences of coastal flooding, reflecting the needs of end users and satisfying relevant national and international policies. An ecological perspective may be usefully employed to examine the impact of the do nothing option on coastal environments (e.g. estuaries , sand dunes and grasslands) and businesses. Although at first sight coastal environmental and business systems appear quite different, they have similarities in that both are vulnerable and susceptible to flood damage or loss and both may be analyzed by employing ecological, adaptive, resilience frameworks. From an ecological perspective many coastal environments are of international conservation importance and provide important ecosystem services including coastal protection, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration , food production and recreation. Nonetheless, despite their potential vulnerability to coastal flooding, our understanding of the effects of salinity on the biological response of many coastal plants and animals is extremely limited. We show here how plant physiology and patterns of plant and invertebrate distribution are impacted by sea water flooding. We also present responses of model plants to sea water inundation based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) predictions of sea level rise and storm surge events. Results showed that coastal habitats surveyed are relatively resilient to flooding due to their species rich nature and their ability to adapt to flooding. However specific groups of plants such as grasses are more affected by flooding and less able to recover. The socio-economic dimensions of doing nothing are addressed in relation to the impacts of coastal flooding specifically on business activity, which has received little attention to date. Here the focus is on the presence or absence of business disruption and recovery plans as a means of increasing a business's adaptation and resilience to flooding. Results show that some businesses, particularly small ones, are more likely to fail to recover from flooding due to lack of forward planning. Therefore from an ecological perspective business recovery post flooding is likely to be dependent upon ability to adapt, which itself depends upon the construction of resilient business environments. ]\n","180\n","iteracion 181\n","[ Aquatic color radiometry remote sensing of coastal and inland waters: Challenges and recommendations for future satellite missions ]\n","181\n","[ Highlights Global systems are not optimized for coastal and inland sensing.

Since the 1950s, the development of coastal zones has entered a peak period. At present, the reclamation of coastal zones mainly occurs in developing countries. The coastal reclaimed lands are mainly used for agricultural production, urban and industrial development, and port construction. The scale and scope of reclamation in coastal lands are larger than in interior lands, and pose substantial environmental risks. This review summarizes the trends in soil physicochemical property evolution following reclamation in salt marshes from around the world. The following important conclusions were obtained: physicochemical properties of coastal saline soils (CSSs) significantly improved over the long term following reclamation in Eastern Asia. Long term fertilization and cultivation resulted in modified soil structure [an increase in the proportion of macroaggregates (&gt; 250 μm) and silt (0.002–0.05 mm)], enhancing the capacity for preserving fertility and C sequestration. Reclamation significantly increased soil organic matter (SOM), phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) concentrations, and soil properties approached a relatively stable level nearly 30 years after reclamation, especially in Eastern Asia. However, in Europe and North America, SOM in coastal reclaimed soils (CRSs) decreased rapidly after reclamation, and soil acidification was also a severe problem during reclamation. Coastal reclamation could significantly increase soil GHG (CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O) emissions, further affecting global C cycle. Microbial biomass and activity as well as activities of related enzymes increased gradually in CRS in Eastern Asia, in particular the activities of urease and phosphatase involved in nutrient cycling. In general, physicochemical properties of CRS in Eastern Asia tend to modify, but deteriorate in Europe and North America. Nevertheless, offshore eutrophication , soil heavy metal and organic pollutant concentrations , and salt marsh ecosystem degradation were the most serious environmental risks posed by coastal reclamation.

China has a seawall coastline of some 13 830 km that is the most popular erosion countermeasure along the Chinese coast; groynes and breakwaters always appear along muddy coasts or are used as aided structures. The latter are a common way to trap sediment in a particular coastal cell to maintain the nourished beach width; reclamation has already produced 12 000 km 2 of new land for the Chinese coastal area since the 1940's, including artificial islands in recent years. Soft engineering and combined structures are more and more popular in China; including those in Taiwan there are 34 documented nourishment sites. Other significant countermeasures to protect the coastline include planting Spartina alterniflora , mangrove afforestation , coral reef transplants, and introducing marine natural reserves. Since its introduction in the 1980's, over 34 km 2 of coastal wetland has been covered by Spartina alterniflora in China. Mangrove afforestation and coral reef transplants have also been carried out in the south China coastal area as environmentally friendly measures for coastal management, together with the declaration of marine natural reserves.

This review is focused on NBI approaches to improve coastal resilience in the face of extreme storm events, including hurricanes . We not only consider the role of NBI as a measure to protect people and property but also in the context of other ecological goods and services provided by tidal wetlands including production of fish and shellfish. Although the results of many studies suggest that populated areas protected by coastal marshes were less likely to experience damage when exposed to the full force of storm surge, it was absolutely critical to place the role of coastal wetlands into perspective by noting that while tidal marshes can reduce wave energy from low-to-moderate-energy storms, their capacity to substantially reduce storm surge remains poorly quantified. Moreover, although tidal marshes can reduce storm surge from fast moving storms, very large expanses of habitat are needed to be most effective, and for most urban settings, there is insufficient space to rely on nature-based risk reduction strategies alone. The success of a given NBI method is also context dependent on local conditions, with potentially confounding influences from substrate characteristics, topography, near shore bathymetry , distance from the shore and other physical factors and human drivers such as development patterns. Furthermore, it is important to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of newly developed NBI projects through rigorous evaluations and characterize the local specificities of the particular built and natural environments surrounding these coastal areas. In order for the relevant science to better inform policy, and assist in land-use challenges, scientists must clearly state the likelihood of success in a particular circumstance and set of conditions.

The proposed approach provides reduction in distance travelled and energy consumption of the AUV to detect the oil spills. , Oil spills due to accidental leakage from Container Ships in a Marine environment poses a major challenge to aquatic living organisms and affects human health by increasing the environmental pollution . Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV's) are deployed for detection and cleaning of oil spills. As the coastal areas are vast and lengthy, effective path planning of deployed AUVs is necessary. Many path planning algorithms for AUVs have been proposed in literature using approaches which necessitate search through large distance. The AUVs have to travel through a large distance to detect the spills in the search area resulting in more energy consumption. In this article we propose an efficient approach for determination of optimal AUV paths for detection of oil spills resulting in reduced search distance for a given area. The proposed approach implements a hybrid evolutionary optimization algorithm named Whale Cuckoo Search Optimization Algorithm (WCSOA) that results in increase in the search space, global search ability and the convergence speed. With the proposed approach the overall search delay and energy consumption of AUVs are reduced. It is observed from the simulation results obtained that the proposed approach provides reduction in AUV energy consumption by 57% compared to the existing Boustrophedon and WOA approach. ]\n","188\n","iteracion 189\n","[ On environmental contours for marine and coastal design ]\n","189\n","[ Highlights Environmental contours used in structural reliability analysis of marine and coastal structures.

Outline guidance concerning the application of environmental contour methods is given in recent design guidelines from many organisations. However there is lack of clarity concerning (a) the differences between approaches to environmental contour estimation reported in the literature, and (b) the relationship between the environmental contour, corresponding to some return period, and the extreme structural response for the same period. Hence there is uncertainty about precisely when environmental contours should be used, and how they should be used well. This article seeks to provide some assistance in understanding the fundamental issues regarding environmental contours and their use in structural reliability analysis. Approaches to estimating the joint distribution of environmental variables, and to estimating environmental contours based on that distribution, are described. Simple freely-available software for estimation of the joint distribution, and hence environmental contours, is illustrated. Extra assumptions required to relate the characteristics of environmental contours to structural failure are outlined. Alternative response-based methods not requiring environmental contours are summarised. The results of an informal survey of the metocean user community regarding environmental contours are presented.

Thresholds derived for coral toxicants from Bayesian dose-response meta-analysis. Exposure levels leading to declines in coral health were compiled for 39 toxicants. Efforts to quantify water quality targets need more standardized research practices. Systematic review provides crucial data and identifies gaps for resource managers. , Reduced water quality degrades coral reefs, resulting in compromised ecosystem function and services to coastal communities. Increasing management capacity on reefs requires prioritization of the development of data-based water-quality thresholds and tipping points. To meet this urgent need of marine resource managers, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that quantified the effects on scleractinian corals of chemical pollutants from land-based and atmospheric sources. We compiled a global dataset addressing the effects of these pollutants on coral growth, mortality, reproduction, physiology, and behavior. The resulting quantitative review of 55 articles includes information about industrial sources, modes of action, experimentally tested concentrations, and previously identified tolerance thresholds of corals to 13 metals, 18 pesticides, 5 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), and a pharmaceutical. For data-rich contaminants, we make more robust threshold estimates by adapting models for Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis that were originally developed for biopharmaceutical application. These models use information from multiple studies to characterize the dose-response relationships (i.e., E max curves) between a pollutant's concentration and various measures of coral health. Metals used in antifouling paints, especially copper, have received a great deal of attention to-date, thus enabling us to estimate the cumulative impact of copper across coral's early life-history. The effects of other land-based pollutants on corals are comparatively understudied, which precludes more quantitative analysis. We discuss opportunities to improve future research so that it can be better integrated into quantitative assessments of the effects of more pollutant types on sublethal coral stress-responses. We also recommend that managers use this information to establish more conservative water quality thresholds that account for the synergistic effects of multiple pollutants on coral reefs. Ultimately, active remediation of local stressors will improve the resistance, resilience, and recovery of individual reefs and reef ecosystems facing the global threat of climate change. ]\n","190\n","iteracion 191\n","[ Origin and residence time of shallow groundwater resources in Lagos coastal basin, south-west Nigeria: An isotopic approach ]\n","191\n","[ Knowledge of the source of water in the Lagos coastal basin (LCB) groundwater system was to be found vital to the future development and management of the system. Stable and radioactive isotopic measurements have been employed to unravel the source of recharge and residence time of the shallow groundwater system, based on the sampling conducted in 2016 and 2017 on groundwater, surface water and rainfall. The concentration of tritium in the groundwater samples were very low and ranged from less than 1 to 2.8 TU, while measured 14 C contents ranged from 59.1 to 88 pMC. The δ 18 O values of groundwater samples ranged from 4.81 and 3.98 ‰, while the δ 2 H values ranged from -24.75 and -19.70 ‰ for the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The obtained results indicated non-existence of paleo recharge; rather all groundwater in the basin were found to be essentially of meteoric origin with intermittent surface water contributions. Moreover, shallow groundwater and surface water have considerable variations in isotopic compositions , reflecting evaporation and preservation of seasonal fluctuation. Though there was an observed generally low tritium content, however, it proved useful in the identification of recent active recharge taking place across the basin. The deduced radiocarbon age reflected the presence of “modern water” and thus supports the presence of present recharge to the groundwater system. Therefore, the source of the shallow groundwater recharge was actively renewable particularly during the wet season and thus water exploitation is potentially sustainable in the basin. ]\n","191\n","iteracion 192\n","[ Integrated coastal zone management towards Indonesia global ocean observing system (INA-GOOS): Review and recommendation ]\n","192\n","[ Indonesia as an archipelagos country consisting of more than 17,508 islands has a challenging problem in terms of island management and the provisional ocean services to the coastal community. The population growth (especially in coastal areas) followed by declining natural resources caused by overfishing and overexploitation is one of the biggest concerns both for the central and the local governments in Indonesia. Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is one of the attempted solutions to overcome these difficulties, however, it is known to be unsatisfactory even after several programs under ICZM have been developed and implemented. Therefore, further facilitation of ICZM programs is necessary in order to benefit to Indonesian governmental management of their islands, coastal areas and oceans.

With improvements in airborne coastal mapping technology and the introduction of regional management for the USACE, surveys expanded into the regional scale, multi-sensor National Coastal Mapping Program (NCMP). The NCMP was initiated in 2004 to produce recurrent, regional, high-resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) elevation data and hyperspectral and aerial imagery to support regional sediment management, regulatory functions, flood damage reduction, asset management, emergency operations, and environmental stewardship. The JALBTCX is a collaboration among the USACE, the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The partners have worked together on airborne coastal mapping and charting since the late 1980s with the goal of advancing airborne lidar bathymetry and associated technologies. The collaboration has fielded three generations of airborne sensors and has transferred this technology to the commercial sector, supporting an expanding market for bathymetric lidar. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the history of USACE survey efforts in the Great Lakes (1995–2012), an in-depth review of the resulting imagery and lidar data products, and new information product developments and applications to support environmental and coastal engineering throughout the Great Lakes region . ]\n","193\n","iteracion 194\n","[ Bridging the gap between resilience and geomorphology of complex coastal systems ]\n","194\n","[ Resilience has been used over a wide range of scientific fields and often ambiguously, causing confusion over terminology and concepts and giving rise to distinct interpretations and misconceptions, even within the same scientific discipline. Starting by providing clarifications and definitions of the main terminology and key principles of ecological resilience theory, we pass on to expressing them through geomorphic dimensions of barrier islands. Three distinct environments (beach, dune, marsh) are proposed as the panarchical levels of analysis, along with potential feedbacks between them and geomorphic dimensions that can express the changes of the stability landscape. Morphological changes induced by storms and subsequent recovery are transferred to stability landscapes, over a range of storm impacts and recovery. We postulate that post-perturbation recovery should not be restricted to regaining pre-disturbance barrier dimensions, but should be viewed in terms of reorganisation and adaptation, accounting for maintaining the existence of functions, or the ability of the system to regain them. The proposed scheme and dimensions are tested using geomorphological data from barrier response to distinct disturbances, over different temporal scales that range from event to multi-decadal ones. The case of a barrier island migrating landwards is conceptualised in terms of alternative states and thresholds arising during the process and related phases and changes to the adaptive cycle. The methodology and approach presented is a step towards more holistic views of geomorphic systems' resilience that we hope will contribute to furthering interdisciplinary understanding and cooperation in the area of sustainability and resilience of natural systems. ]\n","194\n","iteracion 195\n","[ Coastal resort development in Malaysia: A review of policy use in the pre-construction and post-construction phase ]\n","195\n","[ Tourism is a major source of income in Malaysia, and coastal development for tourism is greatly encouraged.

Notable differences in C org accumulation were observed within and among study sites. Highest accumulation in seagrasses, mangroves and salt marshes occurred after 1950s. Land use changes have enhanced C org burial rates and stock during the Anthropocene. 210 Pb dating is relevant for blue carbon stock evaluations in a global context , Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems provide important and multiple ecosystem services, including climate change mitigation through carbon storage. However, these ecosystems are under the pressure of numerous anthropogenic stressors, such as population growth and industrialization, which jeopardize the benefits they provide. Although the common methodology is based on the use of a linear depth scale, this work highlights the need of sediment dating to evaluate temporal variation of organic carbon (C org ) stocks and burial rates, since sedimentation patterns can be variable even between sites within a single ecosystem. Temporal records of C org stocks and burial rates during the past 100 years were determined in mangrove , seagrass and salt marsh ecosystems, from five representative areas of the Mexican marine coastal systems, by using 210 Pb-dated sediment cores . Carbon stocks during the past 100 years (C org stock (100 years) ) ranged from 67 to 269 Mg C org ha −1 in mangroves, 8–53 Mg C org ha −1 in seagrasses and 32–56 Mg C org ha −1 in salt marshes, and burial rates were 8–426 g m −2 yr −1 , 2–252 g m −2 yr −1 and 1–60 g m −2 yr −1 , respectively. Most of the stored C org (60–86%) accumulated during the Anthropocene (since 1950), and in mangrove cores recent C org stocks were up to six times higher than before the Anthropocene onset (1900–1950), most likely as a result of land use changes . Increased C org burial rates in seagrass ecosystems were mostly driven by mass accumulation rate changes (promoted by catchment erosion and sea level rise), and in mangroves and salt marshes by changes in C org content, likely promoted by an increase in productivity associated with nutrient enrichment by fertilizer runoff and sewage disposal . Despite the multiple anthropogenic stressors that positively affected C org stocks and burial rates in BC ecosystems, worldwide destruction of these valuable habitats will cause losses of long-term buried C org through significant CO 2 releases, thus conservation and/or restoration are effective actions for climate change mitigation. ]\n","197\n","iteracion 198\n","[ How ecological engineering can serve in coastal protection ]\n","198\n","[ Traditionally, protection of the coastal area from flooding is approached from an engineering perspective. This approach has often resulted in negative or unforeseen impacts on local ecology and is even known to impact surrounding ecosystems on larger scales. In this paper, the utilization of ecosystem engineering species for achieving civil-engineering objectives or the facilitation of multiple use of limited space in coastal protection is focused upon, either by using ecosystem engineering species that trap sediment and damp waves (oyster beds, mussel beds, willow floodplains and marram grass), or by adjusting hard substrates to enhance ecological functioning. Translating desired coastal protection functionality into designs that make use of the capability of appropriate ecosystem engineering species is, however, hampered by lack of a generic framework to decide which ecosystem engineering species or what type of hard-substrate adaptations may be used where and when. In this paper we review successful implementation of ecosystem engineering species in coastal protection for a sandy shore and propose a framework to select the appropriate measures based on the spatial and temporal scale of coastal protection, resulting in a dynamic interaction between engineering and ecology. Modeling and monitoring the bio-physical interactions is needed, as it allows to upscale successful implementations and predict otherwise unforeseen impacts. ]\n","198\n","iteracion 199\n","[ Holocene evolution of tidal systems in The Netherlands: Effects of rivers, coastal boundary conditions, eco-engineering species, inherited relief and human interference ]\n","199\n","[ Estuaries and tidal embayments are partly enclosed coastal bodies of water with a free connection to the open sea at their tidal inlet and with minimal (tidal embayments) or substantial fluvial input (estuaries). Their tidal inlets can only remain open over multiple centuries to millennia when (1) the formation of accommodation space exceeds infilling or (2) the inlet system is in dynamic equilibrium (i.e., sediment input equals output). Numerical modeling studies often suggest that estuaries and tidal embayments can develop toward a dynamic equilibrium under constant boundary conditions and consequently remain open over centuries to millennia, whereas in the Holocene sedimentary record many estuaries and tidal embayments are observed to have filled up and closed off. This raises the questions whether and how tidal inlets can remain open over long timescales (centuries to millennia), and what the effects are of river inflow and sediment supply. Here we compare the long-term evolution of contrasting tidal systems along the Dutch coastal plain to empirically identify the most important factors that control their long-term evolution. We study tidal systems along the Dutch coast because of (1) high data density, (2) abundant well-preserved and well-described estuaries and tidal embayments with contrasting boundary conditions and morphodynamic evolution and (3) their low-sloping setting with soft boundaries. This makes contrasting estuarine dimensions and development largely dependent on initial conditions, boundary conditions and internal biogeomorphological processes. In the Middle Holocene , Dutch estuaries and tidal embayments were mainly formed by rapid relative sea-level rise. In the late Holocene, they were predominantly the result of natural and human-induced subsidence in coastal plain peatlands. Tidal inlets connected to rivers (estuaries) persisted and attained dynamic large-scale equilibrium while tidal embayments without or with a marginal fluvial inflow were unstable and closed off under abundant sediment supply. Estuaries probably attained a quasi-stable configuration wherein sediment input equaled export due to river-enhanced ebb flow, until fluvial influx was cut off by upstream avulsion causing transition to an embayment and system closure. Long-term net import of sediment from the sea into Dutch tidal embayments is favored by strong, flood-dominated, tidal asymmetry along the Dutch coast, the shallow sand-rich floor of the North Sea, erosion of inherited coastal promontories, and the abundance of mud in the coastal area supplied by the Rhine and Meuse rivers. While sandy tidal embayments without fluvial feeders and with fixed boundaries may obtain dynamic equilibrium and remain open over long timescales, we hypothesize that an abundance of mud and eco-engineering species often culminates in continuous embayment filling with fine sediment and the growth of intertidal and supratidal areas, eventually resulting in closure of the embayment. ]\n","199\n","iteracion 200\n","[ Coastal erosion in China under the condition of global climate change and measures for its prevention ]\n","200\n","[ The general characteristics of coastal erosion in China are described in terms of the regional geography, the form of erosion, the causes of erosion, and the challenges we are facing.

Nowhere on the planet are blue carbon plants which carry out massive carbon extraction and permanent burial more intensely concentrated than in SE Asia. For the first time we make a national and total inventory of data to date for “blue carbon” buried from mangroves and seagrass and delineate the constraints. For an area across Southeast Asia of approximately 12,000,000 km 2 , supporting mangrove forests (5,116,032 ha) and seagrass meadows (6,744,529 ha), we analyzed the region's current blue carbon stocks. This estimate was achieved by integrating the sum of estuarine in situ carbon stock measurements with the extent of mangroves and seagrass across each nation, then summed for the region. We found that mangroves ecosystems regionally supported the greater amount of organic carbon (3095.19Tg C org in 1st meter) over that of seagrass (1683.97 Tg C org in 1st meter), with corresponding stock densities ranging from 15 to 2205 Mg ha −1 and 31.3 to 2450 Mg ha −1 respectively, a likely underestimate for entire carbon including sediment depths. The largest carbon stocks are found within Indonesia, followed by the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Tropical China, Viet-Nam, and Cambodia.

All regional Southeast Asian nation states should assist in superior preservation and habitat restoration plus similar measures in the USA &amp; Mexico for the Gulf of Mexico, as apparently these form two of the largest tropical carbon sinks within coastal waters. We hypothesize it is SE Asia's regionally unique oceanic–geologic conditions, placed squarely within the tropics, which are largely responsible for this blue carbon hotspot, that is, consistently high ambient light levels and year-long warm temperatures, together with consistently strong inflow of dissolved carbon dioxide and upwelling of nutrients across the shallow geological plates. ]\n","201\n","iteracion 202\n","[ Sediment management in coastal infrastructures: Techno-economic and environmental impact assessment of alternative technologies to dredging ]\n","202\n","[ Highlights Dredging is no longer sustainable for sediment management.

Techno-economic comparison shows that sand by-passing systems are cost competitive with dredging. Sand by-passing system results as the most sustainable due to high efficiency, low cost and low environmental impact. , The presence of anthropic activity in the coastal or riverine environment modifies the wave as well as the water and sediment current regime. In particular, the body of water around ports is an area where intense currents and sediment transport rates are usually present and can be affected by low water velocities that take place close to the entrance and inside the port basin. Consequently, sediment can be entrained and accumulated in such areas, creating problems to navigation. Ports and moorings are filled with fine sediments due to deposition resulting from solid transport. In particular, silt particles settle because of the weak vertical and lateral shearing of the velocity field . The result is that harbours frequently require ordinary maintenance dredging . The dredging process involves the removal of sediment in its natural deposited condition by using either mechanical or hydraulic equipment . Dredging is a consolidated and proven technology, but involves considerable drawbacks. In particular, dredging has a notable environmental impact on marine flora and fauna, contributes to the mobility and diffusion of contaminants and pollutants already present in the silted sediments, obstructs navigation and is characterized by relatively high and low predictable costs. This paper aims to provide an original structured overview of technologies alternative to dredging that have been tested in the past 50 years. More than 150 articles have been analysed to compare standard dredging technologies with market-ready competitors from techno-economic and environmental perspectives. In particular, the paper focuses on anti-sedimentation infrastructures and on innovative plant solutions characterized by low maintenance costs and by a very limited environmental impact. The final aim of the paper is to describe the currently available technologies that prevent port inlet and channel siltation and to classify them through a techno-economic and environmental impact assessment .

Most of these studies have focused on particular habitats and have generally been confined to a limited range of fish species associated with specific nursery areas. In this review we conduct a general assessment of the state of knowledge of coastal habitats in fulfilling the nursery-role concept for marine fishes, with particular emphasis on biotic and abiotic factors that influence nursery value. A primary aim was to synthesize information that can be used to drive sound conservation planning and provide a conceptual framework so that new marine protected areas (MPAs) incorporate the full range of nursery areas that are present within the coastal zone. We also use published data from a coastal section in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, to highlight the differential use of shallow aquatic habitats by a range of juvenile marine fish species within this region. Although the Eastern Cape case study does not assess the relative growth, food availability or predation in nursery and non-nursery areas within the coastal zone, it does document which habitats are important to the juveniles of dominant marine species within each area. These habitats, which range from intertidal pools, subtidal gulleys and surf zones to estuaries , do appear to perform a key role in the biological success of species assemblages, with the juveniles of particular marine fishes tending to favour specific nursery areas. According to a multivariate analysis of nursery habitat use within this region, marine species using estuaries tend to differ considerably from those using nearshore coastal waters, with a similar pattern likely to occur elsewhere in the world. ]\n","203\n","iteracion 204\n","[ Toward a better guard of coastal water safety—Microbial distribution in coastal water and their facile detection ]\n","204\n","[ Highlights Culture-based approaches and molecular approaches can be used to describe pathogenic microbial distribution in coastal area.

The enactment of the Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive is the most recent response of the European Union (EU) to deal with persistent pollution issues in European waters. In South East Asia, management frameworks have also been developed through regional projects and programs supported by various international ( e.g. , UNEP) and regional institutions ( e.g. , ASEAN, PEMSEA). In both regions, the management frameworks take a holistic and functional management approach, although the EU member states have taken the action a step further by forging legally binding regional policies . Adopting a common and legally binding policy in SEA has been very difficult due to the varying geographical, political, social as well as economic settings of countries in this region.

New coefficients exhibit stable performance in long term satellite applications. Our method provides a promising path to retrieve a ph (λ) in the visible spectrum. , As a second-order expression of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient ( a ph (λ)), the specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton ( a ph *(λ)) is an essential optical parameter that refines the a ph (λ) normalized by phytoplankton pigment concentration. Based on the in-situ samples collected in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and the East China Sea, this study presents a combined approach to determine the specific absorption coefficients of micro- ( a m *(λ)), nano- ( a n *(λ)), and picophytoplankton ( a p *(λ)). Together with a m *(λ) estimated by the two-component assumption model, our method effectively extracted a n *(λ) and a p *(λ) through the least square method. Independent in-situ validation datasets tested the performances of the proposed a m *(λ), a n *(λ), and a p *(λ) by modeling a ph (λ), and generated encouraging and acceptable predictive errors. The derived mean absolute percentage errors ranged from approximately 35%–55% for several typical wavebands (namely, 412, 443, 490, 555, 660, and 680 nm). Validation by using satellite-ground synchronization samples also produced comparative predictive errors. The spatial distribution of a ph (λ) and the absorption of micro-, nano-, and picophytoplankton were mapped through applying the proposed specific absorption coefficients to Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) images. This showed a spatial rule that pico- and nanophytoplankton dominate the total absorption, rather than microphytoplankton. The annual Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) a ph (4 4 3) product from 2002 to 2019 was used to assess the transferability of those specific absorption coefficients and showed a good performance. The accurate acquirement of a ph (λ) can provide basical datasets for further environment research, such as estimating primary ocean productivity. ]\n","208\n","iteracion 209\n","[ Social capital and climate change mitigation in coastal areas: A review of current debates and identification of future research directions ]\n","209\n","[ Highlights Social capital effects on public acceptance of coastal management policies is under-researched. Perceived social costs and benefits of policies are determined by community social capital. Policies' public acceptability is a product of costs-benefits and community social capital. Social capital effects should be integrated into coastal management planning and implementation. , To develop public policies that respond to climate change demands examination of multiple physical and social variables. In the context of coastal zone management , these range from addressing prevailing environmental conditions, to accommodating the socio-economic needs of local communities and acknowledging the attitudes, norms and environmental behaviours of individuals. This paper focuses on these social aspects and develops an explanatory framework to model the effectiveness of coastal management policies based on the role of social capital. Although some studies have emphasised the positive influence of social capital on natural resources management , so far little research has been undertaken linking social capital as a multi-dimensional characteristic with the level of public receptiveness to policies seeking to mitigate risk at the coast. This paper analyzes the influence of three social capital elements on public responsiveness: social trust, institutional trust and social networks. The paper postulates that higher levels of social and institutional trust result in more positive community perceptions of proposed policies for coastal management. Similar reactions are expected in communities where dense social networks lead to higher levels of environmental awareness . The paper then identifies potential new areas of research that might address the current lack of consideration of non-economic social costs and benefits on public acceptability of coastal management policies. A principal claim made here is that higher levels of policy acceptability are generally evident in coastal communities with strong social capital, as such communities tend to perceive low social costs and high benefits arising from policy intervention. ]\n","209\n","iteracion 210\n","[ Coastal evolution on volcanic oceanic islands: A complex interplay between volcanism, erosion, sedimentation, sea-level change and biogenic production ]\n","210\n","[ The growth and decay of oceanic hotspot volcanoes are intrinsically related to a competition between volcanic construction and erosive destruction, and coastlines are at the forefront of such confrontation. In this paper, we review the several mechanisms that interact and contribute to the development of coastlines on oceanic island volcanoes , and how these processes evolve throughout the islands' lifetime. Volcanic constructional processes dominate during the emergent island and subaerial shield-building stages. During the emergent island stage, surtseyan activity prevails and hydroclastic and pyroclastic structures form; these structures are generally ephemeral because they can be rapidly obliterated by marine erosion. With the onset of the subaerial shield-building stage, coastal evolution is essentially characterized by rapid but intermittent lateral growth through the formation of lava deltas, largely expanding the coastlines until they, typically, reach their maximum extension. With the post-shield quiescence in volcanic activity, destructive processes gradually take over and coastlines retreat, adopting a more prominent profile; mass wasting and marine and fluvial erosion reshape the landscape and, if conditions are favorable, biogenic processes assume a prominent role. Post-erosional volcanic activity may temporarily reverse the balance by renewing coastline expansion, but islands inexorably enter in a long battle for survival above sea level. Reef growth and/or uplift may also prolong the island's lifetime above the waves. The ultimate fate of most islands, however, is to be drowned through subsidence and/or truncation by marine erosion. ]\n","210\n","iteracion 211\n","[ Net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to watersheds and riverine N export to coastal waters: a brief overview ]\n","211\n","[ In recent years, watershed-scale nutrient accounting methods have been developed which provide a simple yet powerful approach to estimate major anthropogenic sources of nutrients to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. For nitrogen (N), ‘anthropogenic sources’ include fertilizer, atmospheric N deposition, N fixation by plants (e.g. legumes), and the net import or export of N in human food and livestock feed, and are collectively referred to as Net Anthropogenic Nitrogen Inputs (NANI). Since the development of industrial N-fixing processes early in the 20th century, anthropogenic N inputs have grown to dominate the global N cycle, and have become the main sources of N in most watersheds affected by humans. It is now clear that riverine N transport from human-influenced watersheds to coastal waters is strongly related to NANI, as well as to hydroclimatic variables (precipitation, discharge, temperature) that can affect the amount of N retained in or removed from watersheds. Potential implications for increased N load from NANI include increased eutrophication, loss of species diversity and habitat, and growth of hypoxic areas (‘dead zones’) in coastal waters. ]\n","211\n","iteracion 212\n","[ Extraordinary boulder transport by storm waves (west of Ireland, winter 2013–2014), and criteria for analysing coastal boulder deposits ]\n","212\n","[ Before-and-after photos of supratidal coastal boulder deposits (CBD) in the west of Ireland show that storms in the winter of 2013–2014 transported boulders at elevations up to 29 m above high water, and at inland distances up to 222 m. Among the clasts transported are eighteen weighing more than 50 t, six of which exceed 100 t. The largest boulder moved during those storms weighs a fairly astonishing 620 t. The boulders moved in these recent storms provide pinning points for mapping storm-wave energies on coasts: their topographic positions mark elevations and distances inland reached by wave energies sufficient to dislocate those specific masses. Taken together, the CBD data reveal general relationships that shed light on storm-wave hydrodynamics. These include a robust correlation (inverse exponential) between maximum boulder mass transported and emplacement height above high water: the greater the elevation, the smaller the maximum boulder size, with a dependency exponent of about -0.2 times the elevation (in metres). There is a similar relationship, although with a much smaller rate-of-change (exponent -0.02), between boulder mass and distance inland, which holds from the shoreline in to about 120 m. Coastal steepness (calculated as the ratio of elevation to inland distance) seems to exert the strongest control, with an inverse power-law relationship between maximum boulder mass and slope ratio: the more gentle the topography, the larger the moved boulders. Quantifying CBD dynamics helps us understand the transmission of wave energies inshore during high-energy storm events. The transported boulders documented here are larger than many of those interpreted to have been moved by tsunami in other locations, which means that boulder size alone cannot be used as a criterion for distinguishing between tsunami and storm emplacement of CBD. The biggest blocks—up to 620 t—are new maxima for boulder mass transported by storm waves. We predict, however, that this record will not last long: the 2013–2014 storms were strong but not extreme, and there are larger boulders in these deposits that didn't move on this occasion. Bigger storms will surely move larger clasts, and clasts at greater distances from the shoreline. These measurements and relationships emphasise the extreme power of storm waves impacting exposed coastlines, and require us to rethink the upper limits of storm wave energy at coasts. ]\n","212\n","iteracion 213\n","[ A review of ocean color remote sensing methods and statistical techniques for the detection, mapping and analysis of phytoplankton blooms in coastal and open oceans ]\n","213\n","[ The need for more effective environmental monitoring of the open and coastal ocean has recently led to notable advances in satellite ocean color technology and algorithm research.

It has been proposed that such environments provide a counter to the stresses of everyday living, leading to enhanced mental and physical health. Living in natural environments will result in airborne exposure to a wide range of biogenic chemicals through inhalation and ingestion of airborne microbiota and particles. The “biogenics” hypothesis formulated here is that regular exposure to low concentrations of mixtures of natural compounds and toxins in natural environments confers pleiotropic health benefits by inhibiting the activities of interconnected cell signalling systems, particularly PI3K/Akt/mTORC1. When overactive, Akt and mTOR (mTORC1) can lead to many pathological processes including cancers, diabetes, inflammation, immunosuppression , and neurodegenerative diseases. There is a substantial body of evidence that many natural products (i.e., from bacteria, algae, fungi and higher plants) inhibit the activities of these protein kinases.

Ongoing and anticipated changes in the Louisiana coastal region promise to alter biogeochemical cycles including the net rate of denitrification by ecosystems. Projecting what these changes could mean for coastal water quality and natural resources requires an understanding of the magnitude and patterns of variation in denitrification rates and their connection to estuarine water quality at large temporal and spatial scales under current conditions. We compile and review denitrification rates reported in 32 studies conducted in a variety of habitats across coastal Louisiana during the period 1981– 2008. The acetylene inhibition and 15 N flux were the preferred techniques (95%); most of the studies used sediment slurries rather than intact sediment cores. There are no estimates of denitrification rates using the N 2 /Ar ratio and isotope pairing techniques, which address some of the problems and limitations of the acetylene inhibition and 15 N flux techniques.

In this review, status of metal contamination along China's coasts is assessed by a comprehensive review of metal concentrations recorded in sediments and marine organisms over the past ten years.

High metal contents can be detected in the sediments collected across the coasts in China. Alarmingly high metal concentrations are observed in the sediments, water and organisms collected from the heavily industrialized areas. Metal levels observed in marine bivalves also consistently reflect the elevated metal contamination.

While their expanse is small globally, areal rates of C burial, or sequestration, are among the highest of Earth's ecosystems. There is considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of total global sequestration in these systems for two reasons: poor estimates of their global areas and high variability and uncertainty in areal rates of burial between systems. The magnitude of C burial in vegetated coastal systems has been decreasing rapidly over the past century due primarily to human disturbances such as dredging, filling, eutrophication, and timber harvest. These systems continue to be lost globally at rates ranging from 1% to 7% annually. We find that climate change including global warming, human engineering of river systems, continued agricultural expansion, and sea level rise will also negatively impact C burial of coastal vegetated wetlands. A decrease in global C burial in these systems will ultimately exacerbate CO 2 emissions, and further contribute to climate change in the future. ]\n","222\n","iteracion 223\n","[ Trade-offs between biodiversity and flood protection services of coastal salt marshes ]\n","223\n","[ Coastal salt marshes provide a range of ecosystem services.

Notches are more difficult to employ for this purpose in the middle latitudes, where higher waves and tides amplify the range of elevations over which the erosional mechanisms are effective, as well as increasing the exposure and effect of rocks of variable resistance to erosion.

This is due mainly to differences in sediment supply and antecedent topography. Early Holocene bay evolution was punctuated by rapid and synchronous flooding. Humans have become the dominant agent of coastal change during historic time. Accelerated sea-level rise will continue to severely impact low gradient coasts. , The results from nearly three decades of marine geological research in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico are compiled in an effort to understand those factors (e.g., sea-level rise, sediment supply, subsidence , antecedent topography) that influenced coastal evolution during the last eustatic cycle (~ 120 ka to Present). Armed with this information, we evaluate coastal response to variable sea-level rise of the Holocene and accelerated rise during historical time to gain a better understanding of how the coast is likely to respond to future changes. The early Holocene evolution of northwestern Gulf of Mexico bays was punctuated by rapid and possibly synchronous flooding events that are interpreted as resulting from episodes of rapid sea-level rise. Two of these events, one between ~ 8.4 and 8.0 ka and the other between ~ 7.4 and 6.8 ka, were associated with known episodes of ice sheet retreat in North America and Antarctica , respectively. During the middle and late Holocene, the east Texas and western Louisiana coasts experienced episodes of stability and growth followed by rapid shoreline retreat, while the central Texas coast remained relatively stable. This variability in coastal response to sea-level rise resulted mainly from differences in sediment supply and the highly irregular antecedent topography on which coastal environments formed. Sand that nourished the evolving east and south Texas, as well as westernmost Louisiana, coasts was derived mainly from transgressive ravinement of deltas that were formed during the falling stage of sea level (MIS5e–MIS2). The loci of these deltas controlled the spatial variability of this offshore sand supply. Sand supply to the central Texas coast has been dominated by converging longshore currents and throughout the middle to late Holocene was large enough to keep pace with sea-level rise. Moreover, sand supply from rivers has varied considerably in response to climate change. During the early Holocene, when the average rate of linear sea-level rise was 4.2 mm/yr, the Brazos, Colorado and Rio Grande Rivers all formed deltas on the inner continental shelf . Today, only the Brazos contributes enough sediment to the Gulf of Mexico to form a delta, but its sand delivery is minimal. A reversal from late Holocene growth of western Louisiana–east Texas and south Texas barrier islands and peninsulas to erosion occurred during the last ~ 2.0 ka, after the rate of sea-level rise began to decelerate. The actual timing of this reversal was diachronous across the coast and was caused by a decrease in sediment supply once offshore sand sources were bypassed by the landward-advancing shoreface (transgressive ravinement). Differences in the exact timing and rate of retreat also reflect variability in the offshore profiles of these barriers and their thickness, which results from the underlying relief on the Pleistocene surface. The late Holocene was also the time of chenier plain development in western Louisiana and east Texas that was marked by localized differences in growth and retreat. The current rate of eustatic sea-level rise in the northern Gulf of Mexico is in the range of 2.0 and 3.0 mm/yr and is approaching rates of the early Holocene. This is on average about five times the long-term rate of the past 4.0 ka. This larger rate is associated with an increase in coastal erosion in historical time relative to long-term rates. Current rates of Gulf shoreline erosion are approaching rates of the early to mid-Holocene and the rate of retreat of some barriers is not sustainable. Core transects off central Texas reflect a late Holocene history of shoreface progradation , but the modern shoreline is currently eroding, albeit at slower rates than elsewhere along the coast. Overall, the sand supply needed to sustain the Gulf shoreline is lacking. Likewise, baylines are experiencing erosion rates that are faster than the late Holocene average and bayhead deltas are at the tipping point of catastrophic retreat. Spatial variability in erosion rates highlights the importance of factors such as sediment supply, subsidence, and anthropogenic influences on coastal evolution. Tropical storms and hurricanes, while exerting the most noticeable coastal change, merely exacerbate overall shoreline retreat and migration. Along the entire northwestern Gulf Coast, the impact of human intervention to natural processes is particularly evident, primarily due to alterations in river discharge and sediment supply to the coast, interruptions in along-shore and cross-shore sand transport, and increases in rates of subsidence through fluid withdrawal. Compared to natural changes that took place during the Holocene, the impacts of human activity have been virtually instantaneous. The geological record indicates that the ongoing increase in the rate of sea-level rise, coupled with diminished sediment supply and human intervention, will continue to severely impact the low-gradient coastal environments of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. ]\n","227\n","iteracion 228\n","[ A review of Very Large Floating Structures (VLFS) for coastal and offshore uses ]\n","228\n","[ Highlights We review the concept of the VLFS showing its use for coastal and offshore areas.

Indicators for assessing eutrophication and frequency distributions have been used to develop scales for characterizing oligotrophy and eutrophication. Numerical classification has also contributed to the assessment of eutrophic trends by grouping sampling sites of similar trophic conditions. Applications of eutrophication assessment based on Principal Component Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling have also been carried out. In addition, the rapid development of Geographical Information Systems has provided the framework for applications of spatial methods and mapping techniques on eutrophication studies. Satellite data have also contributed to eutrophication assessment especially at large scale. Multiple criteria analysis methods can integrate eutrophication variables together with socio-economic parameters providing a holistic approach particularly useful to policy makers. As the current concept of eutrophication problems is to be examined as part of a coastal management approach, more complex quantitative procedures are needed to provide a platform useful for implementation of environmental policy. The present work reviews methods of data analysis used for the assessment of coastal marine eutrophication. The difficulties in applying these methods on data collected from the marine environment are discussed as well as the future perspectives of spatial and multiple criteria choice methods. ]\n","229\n","iteracion 230\n","[ A review of the geochronology and geochemistry of Late Yanshanian (Cretaceous) plutons along the Fujian coastal area of southeastern China: Implications for magma evolution related to slab break-off and rollback in the Cretaceous ]\n","230\n","[ The Cretaceous plutonic suites in the Fujian coastal area include abundant I-type and A-type granitoids and lesser gabbroids. They are important components of the Late Yanshanian magmatic belt along the southeastern coast of China, and define a linear NNE–SSW-trending belt of magmatism . Geochronological, geochemical and geological data from thirty intrusions are summarised in this paper, and the data provide distinct magmatic, geochemical and tectonic patterns in the area. A compilation of geochronological data for these intrusive rocks indicates emplacement mainly from around 125 to 90 Ma, with a major peak from 115 to 90 Ma, and a subordinate peak from 125 to 115 Ma. Besides their temporal and spatial coexistence, all these intrusive rocks have similar geochemical patterns which point to involvement of components from a depleted asthenospheric mantle source for the parental magmas , most probably by magma mixing. The first appearance of sparse I-type granitoids with post-collisional extensional granite affinities, and the emplacement of the Baijuhuajian and Suzhou A-type granites, mark the beginning of extension during the Early Cretaceous at ca. 125 to 119 Ma. The subsequent development of bimodal magmatism at 115 to 90 Ma, with numerous arc-related mafic gabbros and I-type granites, together with some A-type granites, suggests that this major igneous event took place as a response to back-arc extension. On the basis of petrology , geochronology , tectonics, and elemental and isotopic geochemistry , we speculate that break-off and rollback of the subducting Palaeo-Pacific Plate during the Cretaceous were responsible for the Late Yanshanian regional tectono-magmatic evolution in the area. We suggest that this process facilitated a strong and rapid linear upwelling of the asthenospheric mantle beneath the coastal area of southeastern China, with consequential extension of the overlying continental lithosphere , and ultimately the large-scale Late Yanshanian magmatism of the study area. ]\n","230\n","iteracion 231\n","[ Geoarchaeology of the Roman port-city of Ostia: Fluvio-coastal mobility, urban development and resilience ]\n","231\n","[ Ostia is one of the most extensively excavated cities of the Roman period.

BCE followed by a slow progradation and possible erosion phases until the end of the 1st c. CE; (2) the castrum of Ostia (c. late 4th–early 3rd c.

BCE, the River Tiber shifted from a position next to the castrum , below the northern Imperial cardo of Ostia, to 150 m to the north; (4) a possible harbour was established to the north of the castrum during the Republican period; (5) the city expanded and a district was built over the harbour and the palaeochannel between the Republican period and the beginning of the 2nd c. CE, showing that Ostia was a dynamic and resilient city during that time. Finally, we suggest the possibility to combine urban fabric analysis (the orientation of the structures) and palaeoenvironmental analysis for reconstructing the evolution of the city in relation to the fluvio-coastal mobility. ]\n","231\n","iteracion 232\n","[ Key issues and drivers affecting coastal and marine resource decisions: Participatory management strategy evaluation to support adaptive management ]\n","232\n","[ Highlights Improving resource information alone has limited effect on decision-making processes.

We compiled a global synthesis of sea-level changes for the following highstands : MIS 1, MIS 3, MIS 5e and MIS 11. Also, we date the apparent onset of sequences of paleoshorelines either from published data or tentatively extrapolating an age for the uppermost, purported oldest shoreline in each sequence. Including the most documented MIS 5e benchmark, we identify 926 sequences out of which 185 also feature Holocene shorelines . Six areas are identified where elevations of the MIS 3 shorelines are known, and 31 feature elevation data for MIS 11 shorelines. Genetic relationships to regional geodynamics are further explored based on the elevations of the MIS 5e benchmark. Mean apparent uplift rates range from 0.01 ± 0.01 mm/yr (hotspots) to 1.47 ± 0.08 mm/yr (continental collision). Passive margins appear as ubiquitously uplifting, while tectonic segmentation is more important on active margins. From the literature and our extrapolations, we infer ages for the onset of formation for ~ 180 coastal sequences. Sea level fingerprinting on coastal sequences started at least during mid Miocene and locally as early as Eocene . Whether due to the changes in the bulk volume of seawater or to the temporal variations in the shape of ocean basins, estimates of eustasy fail to explain the magnitude of the apparent sea level drop. Thus, vertical ground motion is invoked, and we interpret the long-lasting development of those paleoshore sequences as the imprint of glacial cycles on globally uplifted margins in response to continental compression. The geomorphological expression of the sequences matches the amplitude and frequency of glacial cyclicity . From middle Pleistocene to present-day, moderately fast (100,000 yrs) oscillating sea levels favor the development of well identified strandlines that are distinct from one another. Pliocene and Lower Pleistocene strandlines associated with faster cyclicity (40,000 yrs) are more compact and easily merge into rasas, whereas older Cenozoic low-frequency eustatic changes generally led to widespread flat-lying coastal plains. ]\n","236\n","iteracion 237\n","[ Review on processes and management of saltmarshes across Great Britain ]\n","237\n","[ Centuries of coastal development has led to the loss of saltmarsh extent worldwide. As marshes are shrinking, scientific understanding of marsh expansion and erosion processes is growing. Coastal managers are also recognising the importance of marshes for flood protection, carbon sequestration , and pollutant filtering. Considerable effort is now being made to conserve saltmarshes. However, the rapid integration of science in policy remains an obstacle for ensuring successful conservation outcomes. This review explores how advances in the understanding of coastal dynamics, and the evolution of coastal management thinking, are shaping saltmarsh conservation policy in Great Britain. Saltmarsh management has shifted from reclamation, to protection, to restoration throughout the 20 th and 21 st centuries as calls for nature conservation grew and the importance of ecosystems in coastal erosion risk management became apparent. Studies have revealed that marshes cycle between expansion and erosion phases as part of their natural evolution, governed by processes acting across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Understanding which processes drive long-term marsh change provides an opportunity for coastal managers to undertake targeted intervention for positive conservation outcomes. The inherently dynamic nature of marshes also raises significant challenges in forecasting the long-term value provided by a given marsh. Challenges remain in the monitoring and management of sediment supply and transport, and the effective engagement with stakeholders during habitat protection and creation schemes, which are key to achieving marsh conservation goals. ]\n","237\n","iteracion 238\n","[ Chapter 8 The Eternal Conundrum of Greek Coastal Shipping ]\n","238\n","[ This chapter analyses the reasons that have led to eternal difficulties in developing an efficient and effective Greek coastal shipping system. Being crucial for the national cohesion, the effectiveness of coastal shipping services has been an issue of major importance that has captured the interest of both the Greek state and its citizens. The analysis focuses on the interplay of oligopolistic market features and ineffective state policies that has resulted in an unstable coastal market and has undermined the quality of the supplied shipping services. In particular, it discusses the role of an intervening state in shaping the market (i.e. by controlling entry, fares, safety rules and intervening in routes, manning and duration of employment). It also examines the main economic features of the coastal shipping market, which are those of a regulated oligopoly (i.e. a large number of individual users who express a flexible, heavy seasonal, steadily increasing demand; asymmetric information, mainly due to managerial, training and research deficit; the absence of auditing, high institutional and economic barriers to entry; limited mobility of coastal companies and indivisibilities). Then the chapter focuses on the essential characteristics that a passenger transportation network with a strong public interest has to fulfil (i.e. system accessibility, affordability, safety/security, quality requirements, etc.) and the limited extent to which these criteria have been applied as pre-conditions for developing a modern and efficient Greek coastal shipping. The emphasis is on the absence of a systemic approach that would take into account all the constituent parts of the coastal transport (network, market monitoring, auditing, ships, ports, infrastructure, stakeholders, etc.) and would act as the driving force towards the modernization of the coastal shipping services. ]\n","238\n","iteracion 239\n","[ Biogeochemical response of tropical coastal systems to present and past environmental change ]\n","239\n","[ Global climate and environmental change affect the biogeochemistry and ecology of aquatic systems mostly due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors . The latter became more and more important during the past few thousand years and particularly during the ‘Anthropocene’. However, although they are considered important in this respect as yet much less is known from tropical than from high latitude coasts. Tropical coasts receive the majority of river inputs into the ocean, they harbor a variety of diverse ecosystems and a majority of the population lives there and economically depends on their natural resources. This review delineates the biogeochemical response of coastal systems to environmental change and the interplay of natural and anthropogenic control factors nowadays and in the recent geological past with an emphasis on tropical regions. Weathering rates are higher in low than in high latitude regions with a maximum in the SE Asia/Western Pacific region. On a global scale the net effect of increasing erosion due to deforestation and sediment retention behind dams is a reduced sediment input into the oceans during the Anthropocene . However, an increase was observed in the SE Asia/Western Pacific region. Nitrogen and phosphorus inputs into the ocean have trebled between the 1970s and 1990s due to human activities. As a consequence of increased nutrient inputs and a change in the nutrient mix excessive algal blooms and changes in the phytoplankton community composition towards non-biomineralizing species have been observed in many regions. This has implications for foodwebs and biogeochemical cycles of coastal seas including the release of greenhouse gases. Examples from tropical coasts with high population density and extensive agriculture, however, display deviations from temperate and subtropical regions in this respect. According to instrumental records and observations the present-day biogeochemical and ecological response to environmental change appears to be on the order of decades. A sediment record from the Brazilian continental margin spanning the past 85,000 years, however, depicts that the ecosystem response to changes in climate and hydrology can be on the order of 1000–2000 years. The coastal ocean carbon cycle is very sensitive to Anthropocene changes in land-derived carbon and nutrient fluxes and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. As opposing trends in high latitude regions tropical coastal seas display increasing organic matter inputs and reduced calcification rates which have important implications for calcifying organisms and the carbon source or sink function of the coastal ocean. Particularly coral reefs which are thriving in warm tropical waters are suffering from ocean acidification . Nevertheless, they are not affected uniformly and the sensitivity to ocean acidification may vary largely among coral reefs. Therefore, the prediction of future scenarios requires an improved understanding of present and past responses to environmental change with particular emphasis put on tropical regions. ]\n","239\n","iteracion 240\n","[ Bacterial diversity in oil-polluted marine coastal sediments ]\n","240\n","[ Marine environments harbour a persistent microbial seed which can be shaped by changes of the environmental conditions such as contamination by petroleum components.

The natural attenuation of oil pollutants, as has been demonstrated in many sites, is modulated according to the intrinsic environmental properties such as the availability of terminal electron acceptors and elemental nutrients, together with the degree of pollution and the type of hydrocarbon fractions present. Whilst dynamics in the bacterial communities in the aerobic zones of coastal sediments are well characterized and the key players in hydrocarbon biodegradation have been identified, the subtidal ecology of the anaerobic community is still not well understood.

The genesis of the siliciclastic-carbonate depositional pattern, typical of this East African region, is closely related both to the presence of a quartz-dominate Pleistocene riverine net—flooded during the Holocene sea level rise—and to the coeval development on the shallow shelf of a coral ecosystem producing vast skeletal sediments. The present facies pattern originates from the variable contribution in time and space of three sediment types: skeletal carbonate, quartz and palimpsest debris. The facies analysis allowed to distinguish 10 depositional facies and to differentiate them into three main types of substratum: soft bottom, reefal hard bottom and non-reefal hard bottom. These three types define both the loose facies typical of the channelized coastal belt and several facies of the shallow shelf. In the first, the amounts and textures of the stored sediment are strictly related to three major geomorphic types of substratum: sheltered mangal flat, shallow channel and deep channel. In the second and the third, a wide range of textures is related to coastal flats, benches, islets and emerging rocks. This modern facies pattern is implemented through a series of evolutionary phases: i—during the Last Interglacial Period, since isotope substage 5b, the shallow shelf—above −20 m—is permanently exposed for about 80 ka, with erosion, karstification and cuts of river channels through the shelf; ii—after the Last Glacial Maximum , when the sea level fell to about 110–115 m b.p.s.l. (below present sea level) at 18–17 ka BP, the sea level rose at −20 m for about 9 ka, flooding the shallow shelf area and gradually drowning the riverine net; iii—the maximum flooding of the coastal belt was reached at about 4.5 ka BP, when a gradual moisture reduction caused a decrease of siliciclastic sediment supply; iv—a fairly rapid fall of sea levels since about 4.5 ka BP was probably accompanied by a decline in drought, producing relatively high siliciclastic loose sediment remobilization that carved the morphological steps of the coastal flat, leading to the regression of the coral reef community, and the formation of rhodolith beds. The investigated depositional system is then correlated with the model of a distally steepened ramp with mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentation, suitable for the present setting of the Kenyan coast. ]\n","242\n","iteracion 243\n","[ Biomonitoring coastal environments with transplanted macroalgae: A methodological review ]\n","243\n","[ Highlights Sixty papers using transplanted macroalgae in biomonitoring studies were reviewed.

Future directions towards advancing satellite water quality research are proposed. , Recent and forthcoming launches of a plethora of ocean color radiometry sensors, coupled with increasingly adopted free and open data policies are expected to boost usage of satellite ocean color data and drive the demand to use these data in a quantitative and routine manner. Here we review factors that introduce uncertainties to various satellite-derived water quality products and recommend approaches to minimize the uncertainty of a specific product. We show that the regression relationships between remote-sensing reflectance and water turbidity (in terms of nephelometric units) established for different regions tend to converge and therefore it is plausible to develop a global satellite water turbidity product derived using a single algorithm. In contrast, solutions to derive suspended particulate matter concentration are much less generalizable; in one case it might be more accurate to estimate this parameter based on satellite-derived particulate backscattering coefficient, whereas in another the nonagal particulate absorption coefficient might be a better proxy. Regarding satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration, known to be subject to large uncertainties in coastal waters, studies summarized here clearly indicate that the accuracy of classical reflectance band-ratio algorithms depends largely on the contribution of phytoplankton to total light absorption coefficient as well as the degree of correlation between phytoplankton and the dominant nonalgal contributions. Our review also indicates that currently available satellite-derived water quality products are restricted to optically significant materials, whereas many users are interested in toxins, nutrients, pollutants, and pathogens. Presently, proxies or indicators for these constituents are inconsistently (and often incorrectly) developed and applied. Progress in this general direction will remain slow unless, (i) optical oceanographers and environmental scientists start collaborating more closely and make optical and environmental measurements in parallel, (ii) more efforts are devoted to identifying optical, ecological, and environmental forerunners of autochthonous water quality issues (e.g., onsite growth of pathogens), and, (iii) environmental processes associated with the source, transport, and transformation of allochthonous issues (e.g., transport of nutrients) are better understood. Accompanying these challenges, the need still exists to conduct fundamental research in satellite ocean color radiometry, including development of more robust atmospheric correction methods as well as inverse models for coastal regions where optical properties of both aerosols and hydrosols are complex. ]\n","244\n","iteracion 245\n","[ Waterlogging, crop damage and adaptation interventions in the coastal region of Bangladesh: A perception analysis of local people ]\n","245\n","[ Waterlogging is a persistent problem resulting in damage to crops and therefore livelihood of the coastal people in the southwestern region of Bangladesh.

Concurrent mixed methods of research were employed and a total of 200 households were interviewed. The findings revealed that lack of silt removal or dredging in canals, reduction of water flow in canals and encroachment of canals were the main causes of waterlogging. Major demographic, social and economic characteristics of the surveyed households rarely affected crop production. It was also observed that delayed cropping reduced waterlogging-induced crop damage in coastal areas. Although local people spontaneously participated in traditional adaptation methods, they hardly realized their own contributions towards the practices. About one-third of the local people were not aware of institutional initiatives addressing waterlogging. They proposed structural solutions such as re-excavation of canals to reduce waterlogging. Furthermore, majority of the people living inside the polder (a low-lying tract of land enclosed by a built construction that forms an artificial hydrological unit) perceived that institutions and management were vitally important.

This review highlights the main advances in luminescence geochronology of interglacial coastal sediments through the analysis of 547 luminescence ages, most of which were published during the last decade. The majority of these reported luminescence investigations have been carried out along passive margin coasts. Since the turn of the century, the discovery of a normalization procedure known as Single Aliquot Regeneration (SAR) has drastically reduced data scatter and improved precision, with the consequence that quartz SAR optically-stimulated luminescence OSL has become the dating protocol of choice for the Last Interglacial (LIG) period. A more complex technique, known as thermally-transferred OSL (TT-OSL), is presumably proposed for dating older interglacials of the Mid-Pleistocene and beyond. Feldspar luminescence is increasingly being applied to dating Pleistocene sea level high stands due to a much higher dose saturation level than quartz OSL. The use of feldspar IRSL (Infrared-stimulated luminescence) is limited by the occurrence of variable, but ubiquitous anomalous fading (AF). Following the advent of AF-correction methods, several Middle Pleistocene sites have been amenable to dating, albeit with significant related uncertainties. Recently, new protocols involving the measurement of post-IR IRSL at elevated temperatures have yielded relatively coherent ages for interglacial sediments up to ca. 300 ka. Quartz OSL/TT-OSL, AF-corrected IRSL, and post-IR IRSL ages are generally correlated with periods of sea level high stands. A few ages are reported from the early and middle part of the Middle Pleistocene, as MIS11, 9 and more commonly MIS7 high stands are documented in strongly uplifting active margin coasts. However, by far the most obvious age peak corresponds to the end of the LIG. The MIS5e shoreline is probably the most studied and luminescence-dated coastal feature of all, as the chronology of the sea level markers is crucial to assess global eustatic sea level variations through the course of the last interglacial. Nevertheless, the observed abundance of young (100–120 ka) luminescence ages for presumed MIS5e sediments may underline methodological issues, and/or reflect the higher preservation potential of late regressive sequences. On the other hand, the occurrence of geographically distant reports of MIS5a high stand might reflect a true eustatic origin for this event. Age analysis supports the impression of general reliability of luminescence for the timing of former sea level high stands. There is a clear need to address issues in dose rate variability, in the phenomenology of fading in feldspar, and in the behaviour of luminescence growth with dose, both in laboratory and natural conditions. These could be addressed and properly evaluated by dating different minerals, as multiple or single grains, with consequent variable internal dose rates. More robust practices in the application of luminescence dating techniques could eventually constrain the age uncertainties to no better than 2–3%. Therefore, the strength of luminescence as a dating tool is more in terms of its extended age range and the ubiquity of datable material. ]\n","250\n","iteracion 251\n","[ Quantifying submarine groundwater discharge in the coastal zone via multiple methods ]\n","251\n","[ Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is now recognized as an important pathway between land and sea. As such, this flow may contribute to the biogeochemical and other marine budgets of near-shore waters. These discharges typically display significant spatial and temporal variability making assessments difficult. Groundwater seepage is patchy, diffuse, temporally variable, and may involve multiple aquifers. Thus, the measurement of its magnitude and associated chemical fluxes is a challenging enterprise. A joint project of UNESCO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has examined several methods of SGD assessment and carried out a series of five intercomparison experiments in different hydrogeologic environments (coastal plain, karst, glacial till, fractured crystalline rock, and volcanic terrains). This report reviews the scientific and management significance of SGD, measurement approaches, and the results of the intercomparison experiments. We conclude that while the process is essentially ubiquitous in coastal areas, the assessment of its magnitude at any one location is subject to enough variability that measurements should be made by a variety of techniques and over large enough spatial and temporal scales to capture the majority of these changing conditions. We feel that all the measurement techniques described here are valid although they each have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is recommended that multiple approaches be applied whenever possible. In addition, a continuing effort is required in order to capture long-period tidal fluctuations, storm effects, and seasonal variations. ]\n","251\n","iteracion 252\n","[ Observational and numerical modeling methods for quantifying coastal ocean turbulence and mixing ]\n","252\n","[ In this review paper, state-of-the-art observational and numerical modeling methods for small scale turbulence and mixing with applications to coastal oceans are presented in one context. Unresolved dynamics and remaining problems of field observations and numerical simulations are reviewed on the basis of the approach that modern process-oriented studies should be based on both observations and models. First of all, the basic dynamics of surface and bottom boundary layers as well as intermediate stratified regimes including the interaction of turbulence and internal waves are briefly discussed. Then, an overview is given on just established or recently emerging mechanical, acoustic and optical observational techniques. Microstructure shear probes although developed already in the 1970s have only recently become reliable commercial products. Specifically under surface waves turbulence measurements are difficult due to the necessary decomposition of waves and turbulence. The methods to apply Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) for estimations of Reynolds stresses, turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation rates are under further development. Finally, applications of well-established turbulence resolving particle image velocimetry (PIV) to the dynamics of the bottom boundary layer are presented. As counterpart to the field methods the state-of-the-art in numerical modeling in coastal seas is presented. This includes the application of the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method to shallow water Langmuir Circulation (LC) and to stratified flow over a topographic obstacle. Furthermore, statistical turbulence closure methods as well as empirical turbulence parameterizations and their applicability to coastal ocean turbulence and mixing are discussed. Specific problems related to the combined wave–current bottom boundary layer are discussed. Finally, two coastal modeling sensitivity studies are presented as applications, a two-dimensional study of upwelling and downwelling and a three-dimensional study for a marginal sea scenario (Baltic Sea). It is concluded that the discussed methods need further refinements specifically to account for the complex dynamics associated with the presence of surface and internal waves. ]\n","252\n","iteracion 253\n","[ Dynamic interactions between coastal storms and salt marshes: A review ]\n","253\n","[ Highlights Salt marshes are effective in dissipating wave energy, and storm surges. Salt marshes are generally able to withstand violent storms without collapsing. Importance of indirect long term impact of storms rather than of sole after-storm periods. , This manuscript reviews the progresses made in the understanding of the dynamic interactions between coastal storms and salt marshes, including the dissipation of extreme water levels and wind waves across marsh surfaces, the geomorphic impact of storms on salt marshes, the preservation of hurricanes signals and deposits into the sedimentary records, and the importance of storms for the long term survival of salt marshes to sea level rise . A review of weaknesses, and strengths of coastal defences incorporating the use of salt marshes including natural, and hybrid infrastructures in comparison to standard built solutions is then presented. Salt marshes are effective in dissipating wave energy, and storm surges, especially when the marsh is highly elevated, and continuous. This buffering action reduces for storms lasting more than one day. Storm surge attenuation rates range from 1.7 to 25 cm/km depending on marsh and storms characteristics. In terms of vegetation properties, the more flexible stems tend to flatten during powerful storms, and to dissipate less energy but they are also more resilient to structural damage, and their flattening helps to protect the marsh surface from erosion, while stiff plants tend to break, and could increase the turbulence level and the scour. From a morphological point of view, salt marshes are generally able to withstand violent storms without collapsing, and violent storms are responsible for only a small portion of the long term marsh erosion. Our considerations highlight the necessity to focus on the indirect long term impact that large storms exerts on the whole marsh complex rather than on sole after-storm periods. The morphological consequences of storms, even if not dramatic, might in fact influence the response of the system to normal weather conditions during following inter-storm periods. For instance, storms can cause tidal flats deepening which in turn promotes wave energy propagation, and exerts a long term detrimental effect for marsh boundaries even during calm weather. On the other hand, when a violent storm causes substantial erosion but sediments are redistributed across nearby areas, the long term impact might not be as severe as if sediments were permanently lost from the system, and the salt marsh could easily recover to the initial state. ]\n","253\n","iteracion 254\n","[ Southern North Sea storm surge event of 5 December 2013: Water levels, waves and coastal impacts ]\n","254\n","[ The storm surge event that affected the coastal margins of the southern North Sea on 5–6 December 2013 produced the highest still water levels on record at several tide gauges on the UK east coast. On east-facing coasts south of the Humber estuary and north-facing Norfolk, water levels were higher than in the twentieth century benchmark surge event of 31 January–1 February 1953. Maximum significant wave heights were highest off the North Norfolk coast (peak H s = 3.8 m offshore, 2.9 m inshore) and lowest off the Suffolk coast (H s = 1.5–1.8 m inshore); comparable offshore wave heights in 1953 were 7–8 m and ca. 3 m. The lower wave heights, and their short duration, in 2013 explain both localised breaching, overtopping, and back-barrier flooding associated with gravel ridges and relatively low earthen banks as well as the lack of failure in more highly-engineered coastal defences. On barrier coasts and within estuaries, the signal of maximum runup was highly variable, reflecting the modification of the tide–surge–wave signal by inshore bathymetry and the presence of a range of coastal ecosystems . The landscape impacts of the December 2013 surge included the notching of soft rock cliffs and cliffline retreat; erosion of coastal dunes ; and the augmentation or re-activation of barrier island washover deposits. Whilst surge event-related cliff retreat on the rapidly eroding cliffs of the Suffolk coast lay within the natural variability in inter-annual rates of retreat, the impact of the surge on upper beach/sand dune margins produced a pulse of shoreline translation landwards equivalent to about 10 years of ‘normal’ shoreline retreat. The study of east coast surges over the last 60 years, and the identification of significant phases of landscape change — such as periods of rapid soft rock cliff retreat and the formation of new gravel washovers on barrier islands — points to the importance of high water levels being accompanied by high wave activity. Future developments in early warning systems and evacuation planning require information on the variable impacts of such extreme events. ]\n","254\n","iteracion 255\n","[ A review on operational bioindicators for sustainable coastal management—Criteria, motives and relationships ]\n","255\n","[ The basic aim of this work is (1) to review, present and discuss practically useful (operational) bioindicators for sustainable coastal management, (2) to motivate the selection of the given bioindicators and (3) to illustrate that these variables can be modelled and practically applied, e.g., to detect thresholds and regime shifts.

Geological structure controls the spatial extent of the saltwater wedge. Hydrodynamic properties control the propagation of the saltwater wedge. Saltwater wedge position depends on competition between recharge and tidal amplitude. , Spatial and temporal changes in saltwater wedges in coastal karst aquifers are still poorly understood, largely due to complex mixing processes in these heterogeneous environments, but also due to anthropogenic forcing such as pumping, which commonly affect natural variations in wedges. The purpose of this study was first to characterize the hydrodynamic functioning of a karst aquifer in an oceanic temperate climate with little anthropogenic pressure but strongly influenced by a high tidal range and second, to evaluate the extent and movements of a saltwater wedge influenced by both the tide and the natural recharge of the aquifer. Variations in specific conductivity combined with water chemistry results from six boreholes and two lakes located in the Bell Harbour catchment (western Ireland) enabled us to assess the extent of the intrusion of the saltwater wedge into the aquifer as a function of both karst recharge and tidal movements at high/low and neap/spring tidal cycles. The marked spatial disparity of the saltwater wedge was analysed as a function of both the hydrodynamic and the structural properties of the karst aquifer. Results showed that the extent of the saltwater wedge depended not only on the intrinsic properties of the aquifer but also on the relative influence of the recharge and the tide on groundwater levels, which have opposite effects. Recharge in the Burren area throughout the year is large enough to prevent saltwater intruding more than about one kilometre from the shore. A strong tidal amplitude seems to be the motor of sudden saltwater intrusion observed in the aquifer near the shore while the position of the groundwater level seems to influence the intensity of the salinity increase. Competition between recharge and the tide thus controls the seawater inputs, hence explaining temporal and spatial changes in the saltwater wedge in this coastal karst aquifer. ]\n","256\n","iteracion 257\n","[ Geological constraints on mesoscale coastal barrier behaviour ]\n","257\n","[ Highlights Geological influences on mesoscale barrier behaviour are identified and organized into a hierarchy of influences. Initial barrier form significantly influences barrier behaviour; measurement of barrier morphology is essential for any study. Future research should focus on incorporating important geological influences into modelling efforts. Coastal management must acknowledge the qualitative nature of assessments of future change. , Barrier/lagoon systems occupy a significant part of the world's coast. They are diverse in size, morphology, geological and oceanographic setting, and morphodynamic behaviour. Understanding the behaviour of barriers at 10 1 to 10 2 year and 10 1 to 10 2 km scales (mesoscale) is an important scientific and societal goal, not least because of the preponderance of intensive coastal development in a time of global climate change. Such understanding presents significant challenges. Challenges in describing mesoscale system behaviour relate largely to the incomplete evidence base of (i) morphological change in system components, (ii) dynamic and internal forcing factors (drivers) and (iii) geological constraints. These shortcomings curtail the development of baseline datasets against which to test models. Understanding observed changes and thereby predicting future behavioural patterns demands assumptions and simplifications regarding the linkages between initial state, dynamic drivers, system feedbacks and a multiplicity of geological constraints that are often location-specific. The record of mesoscale change is improving with the acquisition of long-term morphological datasets. Advances in technology and chronological control mean that geological investigations can now provide decadal to century-scale temporal resolution of morphological change. In addition, exploratory modelling is improving understanding of the influence of various dynamic and geological factors. Straightforward linking of dynamic forcing and response is seldom able to account for observed mesoscale behaviour. Geological factors exert a significant or even dominant control on barrier behaviour at decadal to century timescales. Whereas these geological controls can be quantified to some extent by detailed investigations of contemporary barrier/lagoon morphology and constituent materials, underlying geology and topography and sediment supply, in all but a few locations, such data are absent. This sets an unavoidable constraint on efforts to quantitatively predict the future behaviour of barrier systems, which are strongly site-specific in terms of their geological setting and morphology. Geological controls exist in a network of interactions that individually and collectively influence mesoscale barrier behaviour. Dominant, first-order controls are: Basement slope; Basement irregularity and erodibility ; External sediment supply; Orientation; and Shoreline lithification (beachrock and aeolianite) An important intermediate level of geological control is exerted by shoreface morphology. Shorefaces are themselves influenced by underlying geological factors, but they are dynamic at longer timescales than barriers. Geological influences are in most cases unquantified and are usually disregarded when conceptualizing and modelling barrier evolution. Consideration of the geological influences is, however, essential in efforts to predict future behaviour at mesoscale (management) timescales. ]\n","257\n","iteracion 258\n","[ Chapter 45 Heavy-Mineral Sands of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains, USA ]\n","258\n","[ The Eastern North American Titanium Province extends from Labrador to Florida and westward toward the Mississippi River.

Numerous heavy-mineral deposits have since been identified within the surface sands of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains. Although some of the deposits are now being mined, others are no longer active, or have been lost to mining because of cultural developments. Some are likely to be mined in the future. Significant heavy-mineral deposits have been or are being exploited in New Jersey, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Some important heavy-mineral deposits formed in beach ridges at the height of major marine transgressions, e.g., the Trail Ridge and Highland (Maxville) deposits along Trail Ridge, and the Yulee, Cabin Bluff, Altama, Aurora, and Chowan deposits along the Pamlico shoreline .

Integrative model of reef survival in dependence of direct and indirect nutrient effects. Coastal run-off-induced phytoplankton blooms impose nutrient stress on coral reefs . Regional nutrient management is crucial for reef survival under the pressure of climate change. , Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment is often associated with coral reef decline. Consequently, there is a large consent that increased nutrient influxes in reef waters have negative longterm consequences for corals. However, the mechanisms by which dissolved inorganic nutrients can disturb corals and their symbiotic algae are subject to controversial debate. Herein, we discuss recent studies that demonstrate how nutrient enrichment affects the heat and light stress tolerance of corals and their bleaching susceptibility. We integrate direct and indirect effects of nutrient enrichment on corals in a model that explains why healthy coral reefs can exist over a rather broad range of natural nutrient environments at the lower end of the concentration scale and that anthropogenic nutrient enrichment can disturb the finely balanced processes via multiple pathways. We conceptualise that corals can suffer from secondary negative nutrient effects due to the alteration of their natural nutrient environment by increased phytoplankton loads. In this context, we suggest that phytoplankton represents a likely vector that can translate nutrients effects, induced for instance by coastal run-off, into nutrient stress on coral reefs in considerable distance to the site of primary nutrient enrichment. The presented synthesis of the literature suggests that the effects of nutrient enrichment and eutrophication beyond certain thresholds are negative for the physiological performance of the coral individual and for ecosystem functioning. Hence, the immediate implementation of knowledge-based nutrient management strategies is crucial for coral reef survival. ]\n","259\n","iteracion 260\n","[ The Atlantic blue crab Callinectes sapidus in southern European coastal waters: Distribution, impact and prospective invasion management strategies ]\n","260\n","[ Highlights The Atlantic blue crab Callinectes sapidus is invasive in southern European waters.

Sedimentary basins and delta heads, and delta lobes were active since the formation of the Gondwana. Model of inheritance and continuum of Gondwanan structural trends. , The Indian subcontinent comprises accreted cratonic fragments that underwent subsequent rifting–subduction–collision processes along major mobile belts. It is also a storehouse of a prolonged history of crustal evolution involving repeated episodes of magmatism , volcanism , sedimentation, and metamorphism , and the formation of intracratonic and foreland basins . The geologic–geomorphic evolution of the Peninsula is recorded in relic faults/suture zones that confine Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic sedimentary basins and landforms . In addition, escarpments , plateaus, waterfalls , deltas, planation surfaces, and strandlines are either aligned parallel and/or formed over them. Asymmetric relief across the western–eastern parts of the Peninsula, orographic effect on the precipitation pattern and climatic zones provide important constrains on the geologic and geomorphic evolution of the region. Though extensive continental and coastal deposition occurred during Permo-Triassic and Early Cretaceous , only the downwarped grabens of Gondwana basins preserved the sedimentary records. Occurrences of extensive Cenozoic deposits offshore and Neogene–Holocene deltaic deposits along the entire east coast as opposed to the absence of comparable deltaic sequences in the west coast are linked to intense and recurrent episodes of denudation indicating first-order control of basement structures over landscape evolution . Inheritance and continuum of basement structures over climate, and landscape evolution of Peninsular India can also be witnessed by the unique and diverse drainage patterns of major rivers. While most of the major rivers follow a general easterly direction, the landscape morphology of their catchments indicates youthful character and tectonically active nature. The east flowing rivers show an asymmetry between the areal extents of drainage basin size and delta, whereas the west-flowing rivers are short and straight and their catchments are miniscule in comparison with the rivers flowing toward east. The Western Ghats Escarpment forms an orographic barrier and acts as the main divide between these two drainage systems. There is a disparity between the quanta of sediment discharge as well. In addition, the eastern and western parts of India, across the Western Ghats Escarpment, show significant differences in terms of climatic zones (humid to per-humid on the west while it is arid to subhumid on the east). The west coast is characterized by &gt; 3000 mm/year annual rainfall, that often reaches &gt; 5000 mm/year, dominance of SW monsoon winds, occurrence of narrow (&lt; 60 km), rocky, crenulated and coastal cliffs and pocket beaches, and net southerly long shore sediment transport . In contrast, the east coast is characterized by several hundred kilometers wide deltaic low lands built by major rivers. These rivers show trellis to dendritic stream patterns and follow major basement faults that are associated with geologic–historic–recent seismic activity. The sedimentary basins and delta heads, strandlines, and active delta lobes whose western boundary is always limited by basement faults have shown activity since the formation of the Gondwanan supercontinent . The eastern coastal region is also different from the west in terms of active NE monsoon, long shore sediment transport (toward north), and the formation of extensive lagoon-beach barrier systems since Neogene that in turn continue to occur until recent. Here we propose a conceptual tectono-geomorphic model demonstrating the inheritance and continuum of Gondwanan structural trends on the transient landscape of Peninsular India. ]\n","261\n","iteracion 262\n","[ Ecological and evolutionary consequences of coastal invasions ]\n","262\n","[ Although coastal estuarine and marine systems are among the most heavily invaded systems in the world, the study of nonindigenous species in these systems has, historically, lagged behind that of terrestrial and freshwater systems.

Results indicated that low salinity zones existed in the experimental treatments and had expanded during drip irrigation when SMP was controlled at higher than −25 kPa, the average electrical conductivity of the saturation paste extract (ECe) in root zones was below 8 dS m −1 for −5, −10, −15, −20 and −25 kPa treatments, and the highest ratio of desalinization (the removal of salt content accounted for the percentage of initial salt content by leaching) in the whole soil profile for the −5 kPa treatment was 64.4%. Meanwhile, the pH of saturated soil extracts concomitantly increased with drip irrigation in the soil profile, whereas it was slightly affected by SMP under drip irrigation. In addition, the hydraulic conductivities, Gardner α and the contribution of macropores (&gt;0.5 mm) and mesopores (0.5–0.25 mm) to water flow in the surface layer in all five SMP treatments were greater than those in the CK treatment, which indicated that the soil structure had improved.

The first observations of the fetch effect go back 70 years and the concept has been widely used in a variety of landscapes. This paper reviews the present state of knowledge of the fetch effect, with particular reference to its application in coastal areas, and compares findings from theoretical, wind tunnel, and fieldwork experiments. While wind tunnel experiments tend to show critical fetch distances of a few metres, studies in natural areas show that measured critical fetch distance can exceed one hundred metres. There is supporting evidence pointing to the role of soil clods/crusts and moisture content in increasing critical fetch distances in agricultural and coastal areas, respectively. In coastal areas tradeoffs imposed by the geometry of the beach over which the wind is blowing and wind direction determine the available fetch distance and thus the sediment transport rate downwind. A major challenge which needs to be addressed is the development of robust equations for predicting both the critical fetch length and the increase in the sediment transport rate with distance on beaches. There is also a need to obtain field data on the combined effect of moisture, angle of wind approach, beach width, and fetch length. Long-term monitoring using remote sensing techniques may provide valuable data to analyze the effect of fetch distances on the nature of transport events that deliver sediment from the beach to the foredune. ]\n","269\n","iteracion 270\n","[ Blue mussels ( Mytilus edulis spp.) as sentinel organisms in coastal pollution monitoring: A review ]\n","270\n","[ Highlights An overview of blue mussel ecotoxicology and pollution monitoring was provided.

For the coastal ocean, the circulation and the resultant water properties, in turn, depend on interactions between both the continental shelf and the deep-ocean and the continental shelf and the estuaries since the deep-ocean and the estuaries are primary nutrient sources. Here we consider a coordinated program of observations and models for the West Florida Continental Shelf (WFS) intended to provide a supportive framework for K. brevis red-tide prediction as well as for other coastal ocean matters of societal concern. Predicated on lessons learned, the goal is to achieve a system complete enough to support data assimilative modeling and prediction. Examples of the observations and models are presented and application is made to aspects of the 2005 red-tide. From an observational perspective, no single set of measurements is adequate. Required are a broad mix of sensors and sensor delivery systems capable of describing the three-dimensional structure of the velocity and density fields. Similarly, models must be complete enough to include the relevant physical processes, and data assimilation provides the integrative framework for maximizing the joint utility of the observations and models. While we are still in the exploratory stages of development, the lessons learned and application examples may be useful to similar programs under development elsewhere. One scientific finding is that the key to understanding K. brevis red-tide on the WFS lies not at the surface, but at depth. ]\n","272\n","iteracion 273\n","[ Mid-Pliocene shorelines of the US Atlantic Coastal Plain — An improved elevation database with comparison to Earth model predictions ]\n","273\n","[ For nearly a century, the Atlantic Coastal Plain (ACP) of the United States has been the focus of studies investigating Pliocene and Pleistocene shorelines , however, the mapping of paleoshorelines was primarily done by using elevation contours on topographic maps. Here we review published geologic maps and compare them to paleoshoreline locations obtained through geomorphometric classification and satellite data. We furthermore present the results of an extensive field campaign that measured the mid-Pliocene (~ 3.3–2.9 Ma) shorelines of the Atlantic Coastal Plain using high-accuracy GPS and digital elevation models . We compare our new dataset to positions and elevations extracted from published maps and find that the extracted site information from earlier studies is prone to significant error, both in the location and, more severely, in the elevation of the paleoshoreline. We also investigate, using geophysical modeling, the origin of post-depositional displacement of the shoreline from Georgia to Virginia. In particular, we correct the elevation of our shoreline for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and then compare the corrected elevation to predictions of mantle flow-induced dynamic topography (DT). While a subset of these models does reconcile the general trends in the observed elevation of the mid-Pliocene shoreline, local discrepancies persist. These discrepancies suggests that either (i) the DT and GIA models presented here do not capture the full range of uncertainty in the input parameters; and/or (ii) other influences, such as sediment loading and unloading or local fault-driven tectonics, may have contributed to post-depositional deformation of the mid-Pliocene shoreline that are not captured in the above models. In this context, our field measurements represent an important observational dataset with which to compare future generations of geodynamic models. Improvements in models for DT, GIA and other relevant processes, together with an expanded, geographically distributed set of shoreline records, will ultimately be the key to obtaining more accurate estimates of eustatic sea level not only in the mid-Pliocene but also earlier in the Cenozoic. ]\n","273\n","iteracion 274\n","[ Goals, beneficiaries, and indicators of waterfront revitalization in Great Lakes Areas of Concern and coastal communities ]\n","274\n","[ Cleanup of Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs) restores environmental benefits to waterfront communities and is an essential condition for revitalization.

A suggested list of criteria has been prepared for future researchers to increase the quantity and quality of the data. , Human activities such as seashore reclamation can have profound negative impacts on the macrobenthos of coastal wetlands. Using the Yellow River Delta as a case study, we conducted a thorough search of the literature to create a synthesis about the effects of reclamation processes. We found 31 publications that met our selection criteria, and we summarized their data to systematically quantify the impacts of reclamation on the dominant species, biomass, abundance, and biodiversity indices. We found that the dominant species changed remarkably, from Mollusca in the 1980s to Polychaeta, Crustacea, and Insecta (indicating a transition from a marine to a terrestrial environment) after 2000. The number of macrobenthos species in the community decreased by more than half from the 1980s to the 2010s and the effect sizes in the 2000s and 2010s both differed significantly from 0 ( p &lt; 0.01; t- test).

Nearly all East Antarctic records show a near-synchronous Early Holocene climate optimum (11.5–9 ka BP), coinciding with the deglaciation of currently ice-free regions and the optimum recorded in Antarctic ice and marine sediment cores. Shallow marine and coastal terrestrial climate anomalies appear to be out of phase after the Early Holocene warm period, and show complex regional patterns, but an overall trend of cooling in the terrestrial records. A Mid to Late Holocene warm period is present in many East Antarctic lake and shallow coastal marine records. Although there are some differences in the regional timing of this warm period, it typically occurs somewhere between 4.7 and 1 ka BP, which overlaps with a similar optimum found in Antarctic Peninsula terrestrial records. The differences in the timing of these sometimes abrupt warm events in different records and regions points to a number of mechanisms that we have yet to identify. Nearly all records show a neoglacial cooling from 2 ka BP onwards. There is no evidence along the East Antarctic coastline for an equivalent to the Northern Hemisphere Medieval Warm Period and there is only weak circumstantial evidence in a few places for a cool event crudely equivalent in time to the Northern Hemisphere's Little Ice Age. There is a need for well-dated, high resolution climate records in coastal East Antarctica and particularly in Terre Adélie, Dronning Maud Land and Enderby Land to fully understand the regional climate anomalies, the disparity between marine and terrestrial records, and to determine the significance of the heterogeneous temperature trends being measured in the Antarctic today. ]\n","276\n","iteracion 277\n","[ Coastal nitrogen pollution: A review of sources and trends globally and regionally ]\n","277\n","[ The past few decades have seen a massive increase in coastal eutrophication globally, leading to widespread hypoxia and anoxia, habitat degradation, alteration of food-web structure, loss of biodiversity, and increased frequency, spatial extent, and duration of harmful algal blooms. Much of this eutrophication is due to increased inputs of nitrogen to coastal oceans. Before the advent of the industrial revolution and the green revolution, the rate of supply of nitrogen on Earth was limited to the rate of bacterial nitrogen fixation, but human activity now has roughly doubled the rate of creation of reactive, biologically available nitrogen on the land masses of the Earth. Regional variation in this increase is great, and some regions of the Earth have seen little change, while in other areas, nitrogen fluxes through the atmosphere and through rivers have increased by 10–15-fold or more. Much of this increase has occurred over the past few decades. Increased use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer and increased intensity of meat production has led the change globally and in many regions, and agricultural sources are the largest source of nitrogen pollution to many of the planet’s coastal marine ecosystems. The rate of change in nitrogen use in agriculture is incredible, and over half of the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer ever produced has been used in the past 15 years. Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen from fossil fuel combustion also contributes to the global budget for reactive nitrogen and is the largest single source of nitrogen pollution in some regions. Technical solutions for reducing nitrogen pollution exist at reasonable cost, but implementation has been poor in many regions. ]\n","277\n","iteracion 278\n","[ Tsunami deposits of the Caribbean – Towards an improved coastal hazard assessment ]\n","278\n","[ Coasts worldwide experience considerable population pressure and the demand for reliable hazard management, such as of tsunamis, increases. Tsunami hazard assessment requires information on long-term patterns of frequency and magnitude, which are best explained by inverse power-law functions. In areas with a short historical documentation, long-term patterns must therefore be based on geological traces. The Caribbean tsunami hazard is exemplified by &gt; 80 events triggered by earthquakes, volcanic activity, or mass wasting within the region or in the far-field during the last 520 years. Most of these tsunamis had regional or local impacts. Based on two numerical hydrodynamic models of tsunamis spawning at the Muertos Thrust Belt (MTB) and the South Caribbean Deformed Belt (SCBD), which are two scenarios only marginally considered so far, we show that pan-Caribbean tsunamis can also be taken into account. We furthermore review almost 60 sites for possible geological evidence of tsunamis in the Caribbean including fine-grained subsurface deposits and subaerial coarse clasts , and re-evaluate their implications for tsunami hazard assessment against state-of-the-art models of onshore sediment deposition by tsunamis and extreme storms. The records span the mid- to late Holocene , with very few exceptions of Pleistocene age. Only a limited number of reliable palaeotsunami records with consistent and robust age control were identified, hampering inter-island or interregional correlation of deposits of the same event. Distinguishing between storm and tsunami transport of solitary boulders is very difficult in most cases, whereas those clasts arranged as ridges or incorporated into polymodal ridge complexes, which line many windward coasts of the Caribbean, can mainly be attributed to long-term formation during strong storms, overprinting potential tsunami signatures. The quantification of tsunami flooding parameters such as flow depth, inundation distance or flow velocities, by applying inverse and forward numerical models of sediment transport is still very limited and needs to be extended in the future. Likewise, sediment-derived hazard implications still await implementation in spatial planning. As extreme-wave deposits are clearly understudied in the Caribbean, there is great potential for coastal hazard assessment to be developed and improved. Thus, further studies using common standards of high-resolution methods of bedform and stratigraphical documentation and robust chronological models with independent age control, combined with refined inverse and forward models of sediment transport and deposition are required to reconstruct reliable patterns of magnitude and frequency of palaeotsunamis in the Caribbean and to map hazard-prone areas. To date, known palaeotsunami deposits from the Caribbean probably represent only a fraction of actually happened prehistoric tsunamis and, therefore, do not reflect major tsunami inundations of the past adequately. ]\n","278\n","iteracion 279\n","[ Modelling sea level rise (SLR) impacts on salt marsh detrital outwelling C and N exports from an estuarine coastal lagoon to the ocean (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal) ]\n","279\n","[ Salt marshes are well-known sinks of carbon and nitrogen, incorporating them both into sediment and in the halophyte biomass, being key players in the estuarine biogeochemical cycles. Due to aboveground senescence there will inevitably occur losses of C and N rich detritus, becoming prone to the tidal flooding and hydrodynamic regime. On the other hand, the ongoing climate change effects, such as sea level rise (SLR) are known to have influence in the estuarine circulation . The Ria de Aveiro is a mesotidal lagoon located in the Northwestern Portuguese coast, presenting a very complex geometry and characterized by large areas of salt marshes and tidal flats distributed along a web of narrow channels. Residual circulation, tidal asymmetry, tidal dissipation and detritus Lagrangian trajectories were determined from numerical modelling results of the MOHID 2D model that was applied to each coastal system, considering the actual sea level and a sea level rise (SLR) scenario. The results here discussed show that in the case of Ria de Aveiro, the examined salt marsh exports about 15 kg C m −2 y −1 and 2 kg N m −2 y −1 . Nowadays, Barra salt marsh presents the highest values of residual circulation, but predictions point out to its reduction due to SLR scenario. Barra salt marsh shows highly dynamic conditions by being exposed to higher current velocities, increased erosion rates and longer and more frequent inundation periods. This way, model results of Lagrangian particles indicate that the detrital particles are highly dispersed, with large amounts approaching the outer area of the lagoon, a feature that is highly enhanced in the SLR scenario. These features may have two major implications: (1) enhance the fuelling of secondary production in the coastal shelf and (2) excessive N exports and possible eutrophication of the coastal area. These two consequences (positive and negative) acquire even more importance if all the marsh extension along all the Ria de Aveiro is considered along with its elevated amount of plant-generated detritus. Regarding the present predictions and concerns on estuarine ecology in a global change framework, it becomes important to consider these estuarine salt marshes not only as possible nutrient sinks, but also as a potential N source enhanced by the ongoing climate changes. ]\n","279\n","iteracion 280\n","[ Mercury methylation dynamics in estuarine and coastal marine environments — A critical review ]\n","280\n","[ Considerable recent research has focused on methylmercury (MeHg) cycling within estuarine and coastal marine environments. Because MeHg represents a potent neurotoxin that may magnify in marine foodwebs, it is important to understand the mechanisms and environmental variables that drive or constrain methylation dynamics in these environments. This critical review article explores the mechanisms hypothesized to influence aqueous phase and sediment solid phase MeHg concentrations and depth-specific inorganic Hg (II) (Hg i ) methylation rates (MMR) within estuarine and coastal marine environments, and discusses issues of terminology or methodology that complicate mechanism-oriented interpretation of field and laboratory data. Mechanisms discussed in this review article include: 1) the metabolic activity of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), the microbial group thought to dominate mercury methylation in these environments; 2) the role that Hg i concentration and/or speciation play in defining depth-specific Hg i methylation rates; and 3) the depth-dependent balance between MeHg production and consumption within the sedimentary environment . As discussed in this critical review article, the hypothesis of SRB community control on the Hg i methylation rate in estuarine and coastal marine environments is broadly supported by the literature. Although Hg i speciation, as a function of porewater inorganic sulfide and/or dissolved organic matter concentration and/or pH, may also play a role in observed variations in MMR, the nature and function of the controlling ligand(s) has not yet been adequately defined. Furthermore, although it is generally recognized that the processes responsible for MeHg production and consumption overlap spatially and/or kinetically in the sedimentary environment, and likely dictate the extent to which MeHg accumulates in the aqueous and/or sediment solid phase, this conceptual interpretation requires refinement, and would benefit greatly from the application of kinetic modeling. ]\n","280\n","iteracion 281\n","[ Recreational impacts on the fauna of Australian coastal marine ecosystems ]\n","281\n","[ This paper reviews recent research into the ecological impacts of recreation and tourism on coastal marine fauna in Australia.

In this paper we have reviewed the ecological impacts on fauna that are caused by outdoor recreation (including tourism) in Australian coastal marine ecosystems. We predict that the single most potentially severe impact of recreation may be the introduction and/or dispersal of non-indigenous species of marine organisms by recreational vessels. Such introductions, together with other impacts due to human activities have the potential to increasingly degrade recreation destinations. In response, governments have introduced a wide range of legislative tools (e.g., impact assessment, protected area reservation) to manage the recreational industry.

It reflects the recent rapid developments in multidisciplinary modelling in shelf seas. The behaviour of conservative pollutants that act as passive tracers is contrasted with those that have more complex behaviours, including oil spills. The importance of sediment modelling is emphasised, since contaminants commonly exist in both a dissolved and a particulate state, or adhere to sediments. Recently developed ecological models can have great complexity, reflecting the complexity of the real ecosystem. These models are now being linked to physical models of coastal waters and run with the same resolution. This has become possible only recently because of increases in computer power, particularly the availability of parallel systems at reasonable cost. The main advances in physical modelling are likely to come through greater understanding of turbulence and other sub-grid-scale processes as well as increased resolution. In the coastal seas there is often a lack of oceanographic data, which is even greater for the many biological and chemical variables than it is for physical variables. This is probably the single most important factor limiting the progress of operational water quality models. ]\n","282\n","iteracion 283\n","[ Risk and impacts on the environment of free-phase biogas in quaternary deposits along the Coastal Region of Shanghai ]\n","283\n","[ Highlights Bio-gas is distributed in the Quaternary deposit along coastal region of Shanghai; Biogas is hazardous methane gas from humus materials; Methane gas will induce geohazards during offshore and nearshore construction; Pre-exhausting of gas before construction is the main countermeasure. , Shallow organic free-phase biogas is distributed in the Quaternary deposit along the coastal region of Shanghai, particularly in the Yangtze River Estuary and Hangzhou Bay.

Some offshore engineering works, e.g ., drainage pipelines, cross-river bridges, and tunnels, have been constructed in the gassy soils around Shanghai.

Mussel can be a good organism to study the toxicity of microplastic in the laboratory. Mussel is proposed as a global bioindicator of microplastic pollution. It is necessary to develop a uniform protocol for microplastic monitoring in mussels. , The ubiquity and high bioavailability of microplastics have an unknown risk on the marine environment. Biomonitoring should be used to investigate biotic impacts of microplastic exposure. While many studies have used mussels as indicators for marine microplastic pollution, a robust and clear justification for their selection as indicator species is still lacking. Here, we review published literature from field investigations and laboratory experiments on microplastics in mussels and critically discuss the suitability and challenges of mussels as bioindicator for microplastic pollution. Mussels are suitable bioindicator for microplastic pollution because of their wide distribution, vital ecological niches , susceptibility to microplastic uptake and close connection with marine predators and human health. Field investigations highlight a wide occurrence of microplastics in mussels from all over the world, yet their abundance varies enormously. Problematically, these studies are not comparable due to the lack of a standardized approach, as well as temporal and spatial variability. Interestingly, microplastic abundance in field-collected mussels is closely related to human activity, and there is evidence for a positive and quantitative correlation between microplastics in mussels and surrounding waters. Laboratory studies collectively demonstrate that mussels may be good model organisms in revealing microplastic uptake, accumulation and toxicity. Consequently, we propose the use of mussels as target species to monitor microplastics and call for a uniform, efficient and economical approach that is suitable for a future large-scale monitoring program. ]\n","284\n","iteracion 285\n","[ The Rauenberg fossil Lagerstätte (Baden-Württemberg, Germany): A window into early Oligocene marine and coastal ecosystems of Central Europe ]\n","285\n","[ Highlights A review of the flora/fauna of an early Oligocene Rhine Graben site is provided. 69% of taxa from the locality are marine, and 31% are terrestrial.

Our objective in the paper is to provide a comprehensive account of the distribution of organochlorine pesticides in biotic and abiotic compartments of the Indian coastal environment, make some comments on their environmental sources, their movement through the food chain and possible ecotoxicological risk of health in biota including humans. The prevalent HCH, DDT and HCB concentrations differ markedly in eastern and western coast of India reflecting differing agricultural and other usage and their ultimate input into the coastal environment by several rivers and the bioturbation activities of macrozoobenthos (bivalve mollusks, polychaetous annelids, etc.). In several cases, the DDT levels exceeded the effects range-low (ER-L) and could thus cause acute biological impairments, in comparison with the sediment quality guidelines. Contributions of DDT metabolites (DDT, DDD and DDE residues) vary in different Indian coastal regions predominated by pp ′-DDT and pp ′-DDD. Measured concentrations of HCHs were lower than DDTs that might be due to higher water solubility, vapor pressure and biodegradability of the latter. HCH and DDT residues in fish in India were lower than those in the temperate countries indicating a lower accumulation in tropical fish, which might be related to rapid volatilization of this insecticide in the tropical environment.

The role of pioneers or propagules as indicators of an incipient range expansion are discussed, with mangroves, zoobenthos, fishes and birds providing the best examples of actual and imminent distributional changes. The contraction of the warm temperate biogeographic region, arising from the intrusion of cool upwelled waters along the Western Cape shores, and increasingly warm Agulhas Current waters penetrating along the eastern parts of the subcontinent, are highlighted.

On the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fuego there are regressive-like sequences of beach ridge plains in protected areas, and transgressive-like beach plains developed at exposed areas are subjected to fluctuations in gravel availability. ]\n","289\n","iteracion 290\n","[ Estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystem restoration: Confusing management and science – A revision of concepts ]\n","290\n","[ This review presents recent concepts, understanding and experience of the restoration, recovery and human-mediated modification of estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystems. It shows that these can be divided into four categories: natural recovery from a natural or anthropogenic change (whether adverse or otherwise); anthropogenic interventions in response to a degraded or anthropogenically changed environment; anthropogenic responses to a single stressor; and habitat enhancement or creation. A conceptual framework for restoration and recovery of marine marginal and semi-enclosed areas is presented after exploring and refining the plethora of terms used in restoration science and management. Examples of management action are given including managed realignment and the restoration of docks, biogenic reefs, saltmarsh, seagrass, beaches and upper estuarine water quality. We emphasise that although recovery techniques are worthwhile if they can be carried out, they rarely (if ever) fully replace lost habitat. Moreover, while they may have some success in marginal or semi-enclosed areas such as coastal bays, estuaries and fringing habitats, they are less relevant to open coastal and marine habitats. Therefore the best option available in the latter can only be to remove the stressor, as the cause of any change, to prevent other stressors from operating and to allow the conditions suitable for natural recovery. This review emphasises that whereas some ecological concepts related to restoration are well understood, for example, the nature of ecosystem structure and functioning, others such as carrying capacity, resilience and ecosystem goods and services are still poorly quantified for the marine and estuarine environments. The linking between these ecological concepts and the management framework is also relatively recent but is required to give a holistic approach to understanding, managing and manipulating these environments. ]\n","290\n","iteracion 291\n","[ Evaluation of wind energy potential in Morocco's coastal regions ]\n","291\n","[ This paper evaluates the potential of wind energy in six coastal locations in the Kingdom of Morocco, namely Al Hoceima, Tetouane, Assila, Essouira, Laayoune and Dakhla. First, a literature review of recent wind energy potential studies in different locations worldwide has been conducted. Thereafter, the status of wind energy development in Morocco along with its achievements and challenges has been reported. A comprehensive literature review of the mathematical distributions used to fit wind data and procedures employed to estimate the shape and scale parameters of the Weibull distribution is as well presented. The second part of this paper investigated the statistical analysis of wind data based on hourly wind speeds and directions considered for a period of five years between 2011 and 2015. The analysis has shown that the Weibull model independently of the used algorithms for estimation scale and shape parameters, presented an accurate description of the frequencies of actual wind data. By the end, annual energy outputs and capacity factors were derived for wind turbines of various sizes between 225 and 900 kW. The results showed that Dakhla is the most suitable location for harnessing the wind power, while Laayoune has been identified as the second most suitable site. Both Dakhla and Laayoune were found to be suitable for the grid-connected wind energy conversion system while Assila and Essouira have been categorized to be appropriate for the stand-alone wind power applications. ]\n","291\n","iteracion 292\n","[ Environmental-conscious factors affecting street microclimate and individuals’ respiratory health in tropical coastal cities ]\n","292\n","[ Highlights There are environmentally-conscious factors affecting urban street microclimate .

In this paper, we reviewed the drivers of porewater and groundwater advection in permeable shelf sediments in an attempt to bridge gaps among different disciplines studying similar problems. We identified the following driving forces: (1) terrestrial hydraulic gradients, (2) seasonal changes in the aquifer level on land moving the location of the subterranean estuary, (3) wave setup and tidal pumping, (4) water level differences across permeable barriers, (5) flow- and topography-induced pressure gradients, (6) wave pumping; (7) ripple and other bed form migration, (8) fluid shear, (9) density-driven convection, (10) bioirrigation and bioturbation, (11) gas bubble upwelling, and (12) sediment compaction. While these drivers occur over spatial scales ranging from mm to km, and temporal scales ranging from seconds to years, their ultimate biogeochemical implications are very similar (i.e., they are often a source of new or recycled nutrients to seawater and transform organic carbon into inorganic carbon). Drivers 2–12 result in no net water input into the ocean. Taking all these mechanisms into account, we conservatively estimate that a volume equivalent to that of the entire ocean is filtered by permeable sediments at time scales of about 3000 years. Quantifying the relative contribution of these drivers is essential to understand the contribution of sediments to the global cycles of matter. ]\n","293\n","iteracion 294\n","[ Participatory urban planning for climate change adaptation in coastal cities: lessons from a pilot experience in Maputo, Mozambique ]\n","294\n","[ This paper proposes a rights-based approach for participatory urban planning for climate change adaptation in urban areas.

Geologically, the study area comprises of Precambrian basement over which younger rocks commencing with Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary and Quaternary have given rise to varying sequences in different parts. The study has been conducted along the lineaments and these were selected based on the analysis of IRS-1D LISS-IV satellite images and the field geological investigation. The average shear wave velocity, stiffness and the liquefaction potential were evaluated by using the obtained shear wave velocities. Soils are classified into four categories as soft soils, stiff soils, dense soils/soft rock and hard rock based on the obtained shear wave velocities. The factor of safety (FS) against liquefaction is determined and it is found that the sites with low shear wave velocity have FS &lt; 1 and these are possible liquefiable zones.

This chapter discusses some of the activities that affect water quality in New Jersey's coastal plains. The most significant activities are human induced and they include excessive groundwater withdrawal and the addition of non-point and point source contaminants . The effects of those human activities that alter surface soils in ways that promote the movement of chemicals to streams and groundwater is included. The chemicals addressed include point source contaminants coming from superfund sites , landfills, underground storage tanks (USTs), sewage facilities, stormwater runoff facilities, storage lagoons , and other “state permitted” discharges. The contaminants include nitrates (NO 3 − ), phosphates, pesticides, some chlorides and trace metals, and many volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Some of these come directly from their natural or human-induced deposition on the surface or come about because of the secondary impact of these deposited chemicals on surface soils and sediments. Well water withdrawals have also altered the pre-development groundwater and surface water flow patterns. Chlorides from brackish bays and tidal rivers and from the ocean itself have recharged coastal plain aquifers in Raritan Bay, Delaware and along the Atlantic Ocean. These pumping centers are also drawing chlorides and other ions from saline groundwater coming from deeper aquifers. In addition, VOCs and Fe have recharged underlying aquifers from contaminated rivers and point sources toward these pumping centers. ]\n","298\n","iteracion 299\n","[ Oxidative stress responses of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to emissary's pollution in coastal areas of Casablanca ]\n","299\n","[ Highlights A biomonitoring study was carried out in Casablanca coast using indigenous mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis in order to assess emissary's pollution effects on marine organisms. Metallic contamination (Pb, Cu, Hg) was measured in wastewater and seawater of Casablanca coast. Persistent exposure to pollution depleted antioxidants biomarkers leading to oxidative stress in mussels. , The bivalve mollusks are among the aquatic bioindicators that are commonly used in monitoring water pollution studies, thanks to their behavior and metabolism. They are directly affected by the level of pollution in a given site. During this research, the study of the biological response in gills, hepatopancreas and muscles of indigenous mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis were used for monitoring emissary's pollution in four polluted sites in the coastal environment of Casablanca. Seasonal variations of the activity of antioxidant defence enzymes, catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), as well as lipid peroxidation (LP) were measured as biomarkers within a one year period and compared to mussels from an unpolluted sampling site. This study was completed by analysing a series of abiotic factors (temperature, pH and conductivity) and chemicals (heavy metals; Hg, Pb, Cu) into seawater. Our result showed that the availability of metallic contamination and the environmental stress conditions causes relatively an oxidative stress in this species at each station studied. While the pollution's level clearly varies according to the sampling campaign. Furthermore, they revealed a significant increase in GST activities and LP concentrations and significant decrease in CAT activities in mussels collected in sites with industrial contamination. This negative correlation suggested that the organisms at this location are exposed to a relatively higher level of oxidative stress. This first study in the area confirm that variations of antioxidant defence enzymes activities and LP concentrations in mussels could be used as prospective biomarkers of toxicity in environmental monitoring programs. ]\n","299\n","iteracion 300\n","[ Myco-chitinases as versatile biocatalysts for translation of coastal residual resources to eco-competent chito-bioactives ]\n","300\n","[ Highlights Systematic review focused on structure, function and mechanism of fungal chitinase Comprehensible account on substrate-binding clefts and catalytic domains Hydrolytic and transglycosylation action of fungal chitinase for chitin catabolism Alternate microbial biocatalytic route to convert waste as resource , Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) are the glycoside hydrolases (GH) that catalyse the cleavage of β-(1,4) glycosidic linkages of chitin , which is a key element of fungal cell wall and insect's exoskeletons. Fungi have been considered as an excellent source for the production of extracellular chitinases, which could further be employed for chitin degradation to generate a range of bioactive chito-derivatives, i.e., oligosaccharides and glucosamine .

Depth and exposure have high potential for species distribution modelling. Acknowledging interaction effects and biotic features enhances modelling efforts. , Due to increasing pressure on the marine environment there is a growing need to understand species–environment relationships. To provide background for prioritising among variables (predictors) for use in distribution models, the relevance of predictors for benthic species was reviewed using the coastal Baltic Sea as a case-study area. Significant relationships for three response groups (fish, macroinvertebrates , macrovegetation) and six predictor categories (bottom topography, biotic features, hydrography, wave exposure, substrate and spatiotemporal variability) were extracted from 145 queried peer-reviewed field-studies covering three decades and six subregions. In addition, the occurrence of interaction among predictors was analysed. Hydrography was most often found in significant relationships, had low level of interaction with other predictors, but also had the most non-significant relationships. Depth and wave exposure were important in all subregions and are readily available, increasing their applicability for cross-regional modelling efforts. Otherwise, effort to model species distributions may prove challenging at larger scale as the relevance of predictors differed among both response groups and regions. Fish and hard bottom macrovegetation have the largest modelling potential, as they are structured by a set of predictors that at the same time are accurately mapped. A general importance of biotic features implies that these need to be accounted for in distribution modelling, but the mapping of most biotic features is challenging, which currently lowers the applicability. The presence of interactions suggests that predictive methods allowing for interactive effects are preferable. Detailing these complexities is important for future distribution modelling. ]\n","305\n","iteracion 306\n","[ Hydraulic performance and wave loadings of perforated/slotted coastal structures: A review ]\n","306\n","[ This paper reviews recent progress in the study of perforated/slotted breakwaters, with an emphasis on two main groups of such breakwaters: (1) perforated/slotted breakwaters with impermeable back walls, and (2) perforated/slotted breakwaters without a back-wall.

Changes in the freshwater discharge are well correlated with hydrographic properties, namely temperature and salinity, at a coastal site near Seward, Alaska. Changes in the salinity should change the vertical stability, which will affect the mixed layer depth and primary production. Changes in the mixed layer depth concurrent with changes in phytoplankton production may provide a link between zooplankton and freshwater discharge. This is supported by periodicities of 0.5, 1 and 1.2 years that have been found in the zooplankton at Ocean Station P. A positive atmosphere–ocean feedback loop is proposed that could maintain accelerated coastal freshwater discharge at periods similar to those seen in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

These showed that communities mapped to four general regions, which relate to coastal morphology and the characteristics of the dominant water masses around the country. There were distinct biogeographic breakpoints at Cook Strait, which separates the North and South Islands and, to a lesser degree at East Cape, where a warm-water flow deflects seaward. The low and mid-tidal zones along almost all of the east coast were dominated by fucoid algae, with a distinct shift in dominant species around the lower North Island, whereas almost the entire west coast was dominated by invertebrates, particularly mussels and barnacles. Seventeen years of quantitative sampling data, done quarterly or half-yearly in three regions of the east coast of the South Island, were compared with physical data, including the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), sea surface temperature (SST), and wave climate. Overall SSTs have remained relatively constant over the period, but there were large anomalies during ENSO periods. Significant wave height (Hs) has increased at all sites over this period. The dominant cover of fucoid algae varied considerably at two shore heights over the years, but large declines in cover occurred during periods when the SOI index was high (either positively or negatively), particularly during El Niño periods. Understory assemblage structure, diversity and bare space responded to large declines in the fucoid canopy, whereas herbivores did not. Two sets of experiments, done over separate periods of three years, corroborated that disturbance to the dominant canopy resulted in cascading responses in the mid-shore community: perennial understory species declined, bare space increased, coralline algae increased, and ephemeral algae were more abundant. These effects lasted for two years and up to at least six years. Overall, this study shows that changes to the wave climate, most likely in concert with the wider-ranging effects of ENSO, rather than SST, underpin long-term fluctuations to these coastal communities. This study highlights the importance of understanding a more complete suite of drivers and responses of climate change in marine systems. A complex interplay of physical variables, operating on both wide and local scales, can trigger cascading effects, and their interaction with biological, demographic and ecological variables determines recovery dynamics. ]\n","310\n","iteracion 311\n","[ Coastal water exchange rate studies at the southeastern Brazilian margin using Ra isotopes as tracers ]\n","311\n","[ The São Paulo Bight is the arc-shaped part of the southeastern Brazilian margin extending from 23°S to 28°S.

Then, as now, a portion of this near-shore suspended sediment flux was diverted into shore-welded mudflats that were colonized by marsh vegetation that offset local shoreline retreat. The CP is a regressive coastal feature, formed since sea level rise and marine transgression slowed, and it has experienced a 19% wetland loss since the early 1930s. Coastal retreat, up to more than 10 m y −1 , has received more attention, however, and today prevails along more than half of the CP shore. Most structures built on the CP coast are constructed of lightweight materials to reduce settlement and lower deployment costs. If the generally positive results to date are validated, then designs can be optimized to increase transmissivity of high-density “fluid mud” (&gt;10 g l −1 ) during low-frequency swell, while reducing energy transmission in the higher frequency band occupied by locally generated seas that seem to be most destructive to newly created mudflats and marshes. We show that restoration in the CP can be enhanced by taking advantage of the land building capabilities of mud stored in the nearshore and delivered to the coast during storms. The goal is to use engineered structures to increase the rate at which mud is deposited and retained at the shore, thereby harnessing natural processes to reinforce the coast. The use of dredged sediments for wetland creation augments coastal shoreline enhancement. ]\n","313\n","iteracion 314\n","[ The use of large water and sediment diversions in the lower Mississippi River (Louisiana) for coastal restoration ]\n","314\n","[ This study examines the use of large sediment and water diversions in the lower Mississippi River (e.g., South Louisiana) as a tool for coastal restoration. Herein we provide a review, new analysis and synthesis of existing work, much of it previously only available in government reports, and integrate our recent research on the topic. We outline critical knowledge gaps that need to be addressed by the time that construction begins on any future large diversions. The focus of this study is on “river side” issues and the policy considerations that arise from them. The study includes a quantitative examination of the sediment budget of the Lower Mississippi River as a region of potential diversion construction in South Louisiana, due to its critical control on any future management plans that include large diversions. We conclude that development of a coordinated system of diversions and other restoration strategies for land-building will require parceling this sediment budget out between individual projects. However, this is only possible if the input function and its variability is well understood. It is clear that numerical simulations are the only way to adequately predict the combined effects of multiple diversions and other restoration projects, such as dredge-fed pipelines, on the river channel for navigation, flood control and sediment regime. Numerical models also provide the only way to properly examine diversion structures to maximize their sediment capture and minimize any negative impacts. The status of these models and their application to lower Mississippi River channel hydrodynamics and sediment transport is examined herein. ]\n","314\n","iteracion 315\n","[ Submarine groundwater discharge investigations in Sicilian and Brazilian coastal waters using an underwater gamma-ray spectrometer ]\n","315\n","[ Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in coastal zones was monitored using in situ underwater gamma-ray spectrometry of radon decay products ( 214 Bi). Several sites were visited during the IAEA'2002 expedition to south-eastern Sicily, where SGD variations were observed in the Donnalucata boat basin. The continuous monitoring carried out for 3 days at the site closest to the coast revealed an anticorrelation dependence of 222 Rn concentration with tide and salinity. The 222 Rn activity concentrations in seawater varied from 2.3 kBq m −3 (during high tides) to 4.8 kBq m −3 (during low tides). In situ gamma-ray spectrometric measurements were also carried out during the IAEA–UNESCO'2003 expedition to Ubatuba (Brazil). The results obtained during 5 days of continuous monitoring in Flamengo Bay confirmed an anticorrelation between the 222 Rn activity concentration in seawater (which varied between 1.5 and 5.2 kBq m −3 ) and tide/salinity, however, the relationship seems to be more complicated than was observed off Donnalucata. It was confirmed that at both Donnalucata and Ubatuba sites the variations in 222 Rn concentrations were caused by sea level changes , as tide effects induce variations of hydraulic gradients, which increase 222 Rn concentrations during decreasing sea level, and conversly, during high tides the 222 Rn concentrations are decreasing. ]\n","315\n","iteracion 316\n","[ Geochemical fluxes in sandy beach aquifers: Modulation due to major physical stressors, geologic heterogeneity, and nearshore morphology ]\n","316\n","[ Coastal beach aquifers are biogeochemically active systems that mediate chemical and material fluxes across the land-sea interface.

Although it has generated huge employment and provided 80–90% of the total steel consumption in the country, it has faced a host of challenges due to a number of negative environmental and social impacts that hinder the sustainable development of this blooming sector. The objective of this paper is to focus on how ship-breaking activities in Bangladesh affect the adjacent environment and the health and safety of workers, as well as management’s approach to the sustainability of the industry, by conducting a review of the available scientific literature. We found that grave environmental pollution, such as physiochemical properties, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyl compounds (PCBs), organotins, oil and grease pollution, asbestos and other atmospheric pollutants, and its impact on marine ecosystems, biodiversity, forestry, fisheries and human health are the main obstacles for the development of a sustainable ship-breaking industry. In addition, labour safety and occupational health problems, social unrest and conflicts have resulted from the development of the ship-breaking industry in Bangladesh. Inappropriate management practices and inadequate plans regarding ship-breaking activities and processes are the main reasons for these challenges.

Historical, geological, archeological and instrumental records are examined. We evaluate seismic and aseismic generation mechanisms and 22 tsunamigenic zones. A variety of criteria for tsunami source discrimination are applied. Strong tsunami repeat time is 90 years on average, hazard implications are discussed. , The origin of tsunamis in the Mediterranean region and its connected seas, including the Marmara Sea, the Black Sea and the SW Iberian Margin in the NE Atlantic Ocean, is reviewed within the geological and seismotectonic settings of the region. A variety of historical documentary sources combined with evidence from onshore and offshore geological signatures, geomorphological imprints, observations from selected coastal archeological sites, as well as instrumental records, eyewitnesses accounts and pictorial material, clearly indicate that tsunami sources both seismic and non-seismic (e.g. volcanism , landslides) can be found in all the seas of the region with a variable tsunamigenic potential. Local, regional and basin-wide tsunamis have been documented. An improved map of 22 main tsunamigenic zones and their relative potential for tsunami generation is presented. From west to east, the most important tsunamigenic zones are situated offshore SW Iberia, in the North Algerian margin, in the Tyrrhenian Calabria and Messina Straits, in the western and eastern segments of the Hellenic Arc, in the Corinth Gulf of Central Greece, in the Levantine Sea offshore the Dead Sea Transform Fault and in the eastern side of the Marmara Sea. Important historical examples, including destructive tsunamis associated with large earthquakes, are presented. The mean recurrence of strong tsunamis in the several basins varies greatly but the highest event frequency (1/96 years) is observed in the east Mediterranean basin. For most of the historical events it is still unclear which was the causative seismic source and if the tsunami was caused by co-seismic slip, by earthquake-triggered submarine landslides or by a combination of both mechanisms. In pre-historical times, submarine volcanic eruptions (i.e. caldera collapse, massive pyroclastic flows , volcanogenic landslides) and large submarine landslides caused important tsunamis although little is known about their source mechanisms. We conclude that further investigation of the tsunami generation mechanisms is of primary importance in the Mediterranean region. Inputs from tsunami numerical modeling as well as from empirical discrimination criteria for characterizing tsunami sources have been proved particularly effective for recent, well-documented, aseismic landslide tsunamis (e.g., 1963 Corinth Gulf, 1979 Côte d'Azur, 1999 Izmit Bay, 2002 Stromboli volcano). Since the tsunami generation mechanisms are controlled by a variety of factors, and given that the knowledge of past tsunami activity is the cornerstone for undertaking tsunami risk mitigation action, future interdisciplinary research efforts on past tsunamis are needed. ]\n","318\n","iteracion 319\n","[ Contextualising shoreline protection by seagrass using lessons from submerged breakwaters ]\n","319\n","[ Highlights Breakwater literature is applicable to seagrass to predict coastal defence. Seagrass has a spatially heterogeneous effect on shoreline morphodynamics. Seagrass needs to generate a gradient in sediment transport to affect the shoreline. Seagrass can cause downdrift erosion. , Coastal ecosystems , such as seagrass meadows , have been heralded as a nature-based solution for coastal protection. However, the functions of seagrass meadows, including wave attenuation and sediment stabilisation, have typically been measured offshore and do not directly translate to coastal protection at the shoreline . In contrast, the protective effects of conventional submerged structures, such as breakwaters and artificial reefs , on adjacent shorelines have been well described and are predictable. Importantly, these artificial structures often cause erosion in adjacent areas. This study examines how seagrass may affect shoreline morphodynamics by making inferences from existing knowledge of conventional submerged structures. Both conventional submerged structures and seagrass meadows affect wave height and direction, yet this effect on longshore sediment transport has only been considered within the context of coastal defence structures. From the conventional literature on submerged structures, it is known that a constant rate of longshore sediment transport will result in a constant shoreline shape. Therefore, a change in the rate of longshore sediment transport, or gradient, generates changes in the shoreline shape and, hence, the shoreline morphodynamics. We propose that seagrass also has spatially heterogeneous effects on shoreline morphodynamics, with protection occurring in some locations and downstream erosion likely in others. Empirical and modeling research is required to test this hypothesis. In the meantime, this review suggests contexts under which seagrass may affect shoreline morphodynamics and provide shoreline protection. This research bridges the gaps in knowledge across marine ecology , physical oceanography and coastal engineering to overcome some of the challenges of interdisciplinary coastal science. ]\n","319\n","iteracion 320\n","[ Geothermal power potential at the western coastal part of Saudi Arabia ]\n","320\n","[ Saudi Arabia is enriched by many geothermal resources that are located along the western coastal part of the Red Sea, in the form of a number of hot springs and many volcanic eruptions. Wadi Al-Lith is considered one of the most promising geothermal targets that encounter many hot springs with a good surface temperature upto 95 °C. This paper aims mainly to evaluate the geothermal potential of the main hot spring at Wadi Al-Lith area (Ain Al Harrah). The available remote sensing images are analyzed and a number of 2D electric resistivity profiles are interpreted to delineate the surface geological lineaments and the subsurface structural elements that control the movement of the thermal water. It is found that the main surface lineaments are structurally oriented along NNE–SSW and NE–SW directions with a frequency percentage of 52% and an average lineament length of 835 m. Furthermore the subsurface structural elements, as inferred from the interpretation of the geophysical 2D electric profiles, have assumed the same directions beside the NW–SE direction. The characteristics of thermal water of the hot spring are indicated through analyzing the major and minor elements of some collected water samples. Geo-thermometers are applied to estimate, subsurface temperature, heat flow and discharge enthalpy . These parameters are found to be 136 °C, 183 mW/M 2 and 219 kJ/kg, respectively. An estimate of the geothermal reserve using the volumetric method, gave total stored heat energy of 1.713×10 17 J (rock and fluid) and a geothermal reserve potential of 26.99 MWt. It appears from our research that the estimated energy is quite enough for operating a medium scale power plant that utilizes low boiling point fluid (Kalina Cycle) for limited electricity production, beside other low-temperature applications (district heating, green houses and medical therapy). ]\n","320\n","iteracion 321\n","[ Nitrogen cycling in coastal marine ecosystems ]\n","321\n","[ It is generally considered that nitrogen availability is one of the major factors regulating primary production in temperate coastal marine environments. Coastal regions often receive large anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen that cause eutrophication. The impact of these nitrogen additions has a profound effect in estuaries and coastal lagoons where water exchange is limited. Such increased nutrient loading promotes the growth of phytoplankton and fast growing pelagic macroalgae while rooted plants (sea-grasses) and benthic are suppressed due to reduced light availability. This shift from benthic to pelagic primary production introduces large diurnal variations in oxygen concentrations in the water column. In addition oxygen consumption in the surface sediments increases due to the deposition of readily degradable biomass. In this review the physico-chemical and biological factors regulating nitrogen cycling in coastal marine ecosystems are considered in relation to developing effective management programmes to rehabilitate seagrass communities in lagoons currently dominated by pelagic macroalgae and/or cyanobacteria. ]\n","321\n","iteracion 322\n","[ Impacts of pollution on coastal and marine ecosystems including coastal and marine fisheries and approach for management: a review and synthesis ]\n","322\n","[ The history of aquatic environmental pollution goes back to the very beginning of the history of human civilization.

These very high tidal ranges results in unique patterns of sedimentation within hypertidal estuaries. Such systems are not common but they do occur on a number of continents. This report will discuss six areas that have the highest tides in the world. North America hypertidal systems occur within Cook Inlet in Alaska, USA, Leaf Basin in Ungava Bay, Quebec Province, Canada, and the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Canada. In South America, the Straits of Magellan and associated Atlantic coastal settings exhibit hypertidal conditions. European hypertidal systems include Bristol Channel and Severn estuary in southwest England and the Gulf of St. Malo in Normandy, France. These six areas have the highest tides in the world and spring tidal ranges that regularly exceed 10 m. All the six areas can be divided into intertidal sedimentological zones. Zone 1 is the outermost zone and contains longitudinal bars. Zone 2 exhibits laterally extensive sand flats. Zone 3 includes the innermost extent of tides and estuarine point bars. Annual and neap–spring cycles have been documented in Zone 3 and are probably the most indicative features of hypertidal systems. The North American systems occur in high-latitude cold climates where winter ice can have a minor or major impact on the development of sedimentary facies. Conversely, the European and Patagonia systems have climates minimal ice formation. ]\n","323\n","iteracion 324\n","[ The social implications of Submarine Groundwater Discharge from an Ecosystem Services perspective: A systematic review ]\n","324\n","[ Submarine Groundwater Discharge (SGD) is recognized as a fundamental hydrological process that supports many coastal biogeochemical cycles and social-ecological systems. However, very little has been investigated about how SGD affects society and, specifically, human well-being. This study systematically examines the published scientific literature on the social implications of SGD by using an Ecosystem Service (ES) perspective. Coastal services provided by ecosystems dependent on SGD are analyzed and clustered in the four main categories of Ecosystem Services (i.e., Provisioning, Supporting, Regulating and Cultural), which are in turn divided into subcategories defined as outcomes. This allows identifying and discussing both benefits and threats to coastal societies resulting from SGD outcomes. From the 1532 articles initially reviewed, the most frequently mentioned category was the supporting services (835) due to the mainstream trend in scientific literature to focus on the role of SGD as a process influencing coastal biogeochemical cycles. Conversely, cultural ES were mentioned in only 49 cases, which should not necessarily be interpreted as a lack of research or interest in this topic, but that this type of references are often not found in the scientific literature but in the grey literature. A detailed publication review was additionally conducted, identifying 114 case-studies from 96 different locations worldwide that reported cases in which SGD had social implications on the well-being. Our review also shows how the different types of Ecosystem Services can have multiple synergies and trade-offs between them, resulting in unequal impacts among stakeholder groups. Overall, this study identifies research gaps related to Ecosystem Services provided by SGD as well as opportunities for further studies, while developing an analytical framework that relies on the Ecosystem Services approach to guide future research on the social implications of SGD. ]\n","324\n","iteracion 325\n","[ Physico-chemical characteristics and pollutants of the benthic environment in the Montevideo coastal zone, Uruguay ]\n","325\n","[]\n","325\n","iteracion 326\n","[ Wireless Sensor Networks for monitoring underwater sediment transport ]\n","326\n","[ Highlights Monitoring sediment transport processes is important for understanding coastal erosion. Existing coastal monitoring methods are limited to monitoring the visible beach. Wireless Sensor Networks are a promising solution in overcoming this limitation. This will enable greater understanding of erosion and the coastal environment. , Monitoring of the coastline and coastal processes, in particular sediment movement, is vital to ensure that erosion response is appropriate given the dynamic nature of coastal systems. This should take place regularly over long periods and it is important that data are collected from submerged portions of the littoral zone, as well as the visible beach. This highlights two limitations in existing coastal monitoring techniques: 1. they require largely manual operation and 2. are limited to the visible beach, which results in an incomplete picture of what is happening in the coastal zone. Due to the current difficulties in gathering data beneath the sea surface, this paper reviews wireless sensor network (WSN) technology as a means to overcome these limitations. Analysis showed that WSNs are a promising technology for coastal monitoring, not only in terms of overcoming limitations, but also in terms of cost, safety, and the size of areas they are able to monitor. Previous work using WSNs in this environment is somewhat limited, especially as most current methods are largely limited to the visible beach, and do not consider submerged areas of the coastal zone.

Hydrographic data and the distribution of inorganic nutrients were used to characterize three distinct water sources: oligotrophic offshore water, the Columbia River plume, and the coastal upwelling region inshore of the California Current. Warm, high salinity offshore water had very low levels of inorganic nutrients, particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Warm, low salinity water in the Columbia River plume was relatively low in nitrate, but showed a strong negative correlation between salinity and silicate. The river plume water had the highest levels of total organic carbon (TOC) (up to 180 μM) and DOC (up to 150 μM) observed anywhere in the sampling area. Cold, high salinity coastal waters had high nutrient levels, moderate to high levels of POC and particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and low to moderate levels of DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON).

Urban communities, on the other hand, are less closely associated with natural resources and are less likely to take an interest in such initiatives, whilst recreational communities, especially those that are relatively diffuse, are more likely to take a reactive role in objecting to proposed management restrictions. It is concluded that, like many aspects of local coastal management, the approaches taken to community participation should be tailored to local characteristics, and that it is difficult to define an approach that represents ‘best practice’, though general approaches to improving the management formulation process by providing for community input are being developed and more widely applied in the UK.

The NPZ model is that of Franks, Wroblewski and Flierl (1986) , with the zooplankton state variable parameterized for macrozooplankton. IBM simulations are done with different scenarios for behavioral responses; the interaction of the organisms with the circulation is evaluated by examining growth/development, reproduction, survival and distribution. Since ocean productivity in coastal upwelling systems is greatest nearshore, zooplankton production is favored by nearshore retention. Model results, using an idealized, intermittently wind-forced, upwelling circulation, indicate that non-migrating copepods are flushed from the nearshore system in offshore zonal surface flow; highest population abundances occur offshore, in a region of relatively low food resources. Conversely, migrating copepods interact with the stratified zonal flow within the upwelling system and are retained nearshore when the amplitude of the DVM is sufficient to place the individuals in near-bottom onshore flow during the day. Environmental features, like deep-extending food resources, and physiological controls, like satiation or body size, that permit copepods to remain deeper, or spend more time away from the surface, favor nearshore retention. Diel vertical migration is one mechanism, which may permit animals to exploit favorable habitats located nearshore in upwelling systems. ]\n","329\n","iteracion 330\n","[ Morphology and distribution of submerged palaeoshorelines: Insights from the North West Shelf of Australia ]\n","330\n","[ Palaeoshorelines and associated palaeo-coastal features are studied to reconstruct past sea level, climate, and depositional environments . Their identification typically depends on direct field observations and is therefore challenging in the marine environment, where the interpretation mostly relies on sparse geophysical data. This review presents, based on 118 published case studies, a summary of morphological evidence that can be used to identify submerged relict coastal features worldwide, using only geophysical data. Four coastal feature categories that can be used as palaeoshoreline indicators were identified: (1) beach ridges of wind and wave origin; (2) shoreface strata; (3) marine terraces ; and (4) coral-reef terraces. In light of this proposed classification, an area of ~200,000 km 2 was investigated along the Rowley Shelf (North West Shelf, Australia), a carbonate-dominated platform, based on the integration of high-resolution bathymetry (i.e., seismic-derived bathymetry, satellite-derived bathymetry, multibeam echosounder bathymetry, spot depth soundings) and 2D reflection seismic lines. Relict features were discriminated from modern bedforms using five criteria: (1) stratigraphic position; (2) emersion features; (3) similarity with modern and published analogues; (4) integration of modern ocean conditions; and (5) evidence of early cementation . In total, over 500 submerged relict coastal features were identified, making this review the most comprehensive catalogue published to date. Relict features are concentrated over specific depths, referred to as modal sea-level depths (MSLDs), which correspond to depths where the relative sea level remained stable over long periods of time. Nine MSLDs are observed at 20, 35, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 105 and 125 m below sea level. Each MSLD is the result of the accumulation of coastal features through multiple glacial/ interglacial cycles. Most of the features may nevertheless be related to the last glacial sea-level fall and were likely formed between Marine Isotopes Stages (MIS) 5 and 2. The analysis of the submerged coastal features indicates that the overall shelf morphology is controlled by the distribution of these features, and that, while in a carbonate province, their formation is related to wind, tide, fluvial and wave processes. The higher concentration of relict fluvial-influenced features at shallower depths and of relict tide-influenced features at greater depths suggest that fluvial runoffs were limited during glacial periods. This, in turn, supports the hypothesis of a prevalent dry climate during glacial periods and in contrast, of a humid climate during interglacial periods. Finally, the study reveals that most modern coral reefs of the Rowley Shelf are growing on top of relict coastal features and that seabed ridges previously interpreted as drowned coral reefs are, in fact, likely to be relict coastal features formed through clastic processes. Results from this study will support the identification of submerged palaeoshorelines on continental shelves around the globe and highlight the influence of associated relict coastal features on shelf morphologies. Additionally, this study provides new insights on processes shaping carbonate provinces. ]\n","330\n","iteracion 331\n","[ More surprises in the global greenhouse: Human health impacts from recent toxic marine aerosol formations, due to centennial alterations of world-wide coastal food webs ]\n","331\n","[ Highlights Oil spills, heavy metals, and overfishing decimated zooplankton grazers Desert expansions and eutrophication concurrently fueled diazotrophs to set free commensal ungrazed dinoflagellate HABs Nitrogen-fixers set free commensal ungrazed dinoflagellate HABs HAB increments caused ~ 45 million global asthma attacks during 2004 HAB aerosols served as surrogates of inhaled MeHg, phthalate, and DDT neurotoxins Downwind of nuclear facilities radio-iodes carried by HABs also caused thyroid cancers , Reductions of zooplankton biomasses and grazing pressures were observed during overfishing-induced trophic cascades and concurrent oil spills at global scales.

Recent results on the physiological role and biochemistry of the vanadium haloperoxidases of brown algae emphasize the importance of these enzymes in the control of these processes. ]\n","333\n","iteracion 334\n","[ Effects of the 1997–1999 El Niño and La Niña events on zooplankton abundance and euphausiid community composition within the Monterey Bay coastal upwelling system ]\n","334\n","[ Zooplankton abundance and euphausiid community composition were sampled seasonally (spring, summer, fall) within Monterey Bay, California, between 1997 and 1999. Measurements of sea surface temperature (SST), mixed layer depth, and upwelling indices provided concurrent data on physical oceanographic parameters. Both total zooplankton and krill abundance dramatically declined in the summer of 1997 coincident with a rapid increase in SST and mixed layer depth. Changes in euphausiid community composition occurred in concert with the decline in overall abundance. The relative abundance of the southern neritic Nyctiphanes simplex increased from August to November in 1997, the abundance of cold temperate Euphausia pacifica decreased significantly, and that of the northern neritic Thysanoessa spinifera declined dramatically. The sudden appearance of an adult cohort of N. simplex in July 1997 suggests that rapid poleward flow characteristic of coastally trapped Kelvin waves occurred between June and July of 1997. The persistent presence of warm temperate and subtropical taxa in samples collected between August 1997 and October 1998 indicates that this poleward flow continued in 1998. Zooplankton abundance, euphausiid community composition, and physical oceanographic parameters gradually returned to a more typical upwelling-dominated state in the spring and summer of 1998. E. pacifica and T. spinifera abundances gradually increased during the summer and fall of 1998, while N. simplex abundance abruptly declined in the spring of 1998. However, this recovery was confined to a narrow coastal band as a result of the onshore movement of the oceanic waters of the California Current. This was reflected by higher than normal numbers of the oceanic Nematoscelis difficilis within samples collected during the spring and summer of 1998. By the spring and summer of 1999, both zooplankton and euphausiid abundance had increased to the highest levels recorded during the 3-year study. Both E. pacifica and T. spinifera abundance increased relative to 1998 while N. simplex was completely absent in all samples. These changes reflected the cooler, highly productive environmental conditions associated with the 1998/1999 La Niña. ]\n","334\n","iteracion 335\n","[ Modern state and dynamics of the Sea of Azov coasts ]\n","335\n","[ Results of the modern state researches of the Sea of Azov coasts and coastal processes influencing their evolution are presented. A multidisciplinary study of coastal processes allowed us to identify main types of coast evolution: abrasion, accumulation, and stability. Predominance of abrasion is the main feature of modern dynamics of the Azov shores. Not only the parent rock shores are subjected to erosion, but also accumulative forms are eroded. The eastern coast of the sea retreats most rapidly. The intensity of the abrasion and landslide processes is due to the weak resistance of the rocks composing the coast to the wave forcing. In particular, intense abrasion occurs in those parts of the coast where wave forcing is strong together with the surges caused by onshore winds, while the beaches are narrow or completely absent. At the same time, the percentage of beach-forming fractions in eroded soils is low, and the major part of the abrasion material in the form of suspended matter is transported to the deep parts of the sea. In general, the state and dynamics of the Azov coasts are influenced by abrasion-accumulative processes, sea level fluctuations, changes in the wind-wave regime parameters, and fluctuations in the biogenic beach-forming material volumes. The biogenic factor is the most important in the balance of deposits of accumulation forms (spits and bay-bars). Anthropogenic activity also affects the current state of the shores. The transport of beach-forming alluvial sediments into the sea is reduced because of the regulated river discharge. The natural evolution of onshore processes is disrupted during the development of the coast: agricultural activities, industrial and resort construction, removal of sand and shell material, construction of shore protection facilities. ]\n","335\n","iteracion 336\n","[ Human thermal perception of Coastal Mediterranean outdoor urban environments ]\n","336\n","[ This research evaluates the perception of human thermal sensation in the Mediterranean climate in an attempt to calibrate the scale of human thermal sensation for this climate, by applying the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) index.

In the past two decades, seagrass research in Vietnam has advanced in many aspects, including distribution mapping, plant genetics and biophysical characteristics, sustainable use of seagrass beds, restoration and protection of seagrass meadows , establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), and collaborative research with international institutions. In this paper, we presented a state-of-the-art review of recent seagrass research conducted in Vietnam. Despite the recent increase in the number of seagrass studies conducted in Vietnam, these coastal ecosystems continue to be poorly mapped and managed in some areas. Although a number of recent studies highlighted the use of seagrass ecosystems as a coastal bioshield in Vietnam, they have undergone degradation in recent years due to pollution, sedimentation and turbidity , eutrophication and habitat loss. Remote sensing is considered as an effective tool for mapping seagrasses in recent studies, particularly due to the ability to accurately map, model and assess the condition of some hard to access sites. Collaboration among regional authorities, NGOs and research institutions can provide an appropriate basis for understanding these complex systems at a national scale and afford an important scientific reference for supporting management and conservation decisions in Vietnam. Sustainable use of seagrass ecosystems can bring economic benefits as well as environmental protection along the coastal areas of Vietnam. ]\n","337\n","iteracion 338\n","[ Coupling global and regional circulation models in the coastal Gulf of Alaska ]\n","338\n","[ As part of the US GLOBEC NE Pacific program, we are simulating currents in the Coastal Gulf of Alaska (CGOA) to explore sources of interannual and interdecadal variability. To do so, we have developed a coupled modeling system composed of linked regional and global circulation models. The regional model, configured with 13–22 km resolution in the CGOA, is forced at the surface by observed heat fluxes and wind stresses, at the continental boundaries by observed runoff, and at the open ocean boundaries by a combination of tracer climatologies and sub-tidal velocity and tidal elevation provided by a global finite element model. In this communication, we describe the coupled system, including its present method of intermodel coupling, describe a series of multi-year model hindcasts, compare hindcast results with Eulerian and Lagrangian field data obtained in the CGOA in fall 1996, and assess the impact of global information (barotropic sub-tidal velocities and tidal elevations) on the regional model under the present coupling strategy. We find that the regional model produces appropriate current systems (Alaskan Stream, Alaska Coastal Current) and scalar fields, but with mesoscale variability (of SSH and velocities) at somewhat reduced strength relative to data, and with temperature gradients somewhat larger than those observed. Barotropic sub-tidal information from the global model penetrates the regional model interior, supplying additional mesoscale variability, and modifying regional velocity and scalar fields in both shallow and deep areas. Tidal information exerts a significant influence on sub-tidal scalar and velocity structure only in specific shallow areas, where the tides (and tidal mixing) are strongest. Pending the exploration of alternate coupling schemes, we infer from these results that on a time scale of months, purely barotropic information from outside the CGOA will have a modest impact on its mean regional circulation, but a potentially stronger impact on the statistics and details of mesoscale eddies. ]\n","338\n","iteracion 339\n","[ Dynamic exchanges between DOM and POM pools in coastal and inland aquatic ecosystems: A review ]\n","339\n","[ Highlights DOM-POM exchanges are dynamic with various ecosystem processes involved.

Although DOM-POM exchange processes have been widely studied from different aspects, little to no effort has been made to date to provide a comprehensive, mechanistic, and micro-spatial schema for understanding various exchange processes occurring in different aquatic ecosystems in a unified way. The phenomena occurring between DOM and POM were explained here with the homogeneous and heterogeneous mechanisms. In the homogeneous mechanism, the participating components are only organic matter (OM) constituents themselves with aggregation and dissolution involved, whereas OM is associated with other components such as minerals and particulate colloids in the heterogeneous counterpart. Besides the generally concerned processes of aggregation/dissolution and adsorption/desorption, other ecological factors such as sunlight and organisms can also participate in DOM-POM exchanges through altering the chemical nature of OM. Despite the limitation of current analytical technologies, many unknown and/or unquantified processes need to be identified to unravel the complicated exchanges of OM between its dissolved and particulate states. Based on the review of several previous mathematical models, we proposed a unified conceptual model to describe all major dynamic exchange mechanisms on the basis of exergy theory. More knowledge of dynamic DOM-POM exchanges is warranted to overcome the potential problems arising from a simple division of OM into dissolved versus particulate states and to further develop more sophisticated mathematic models. ]\n","339\n","iteracion 340\n","[ Environmental Hydraulics: Hydrodynamic and Pollutant Transport Modelling of Lakes and Coastal Waters ]\n","340\n","[]\n","340\n","iteracion 341\n","[ Hurricane-fire interactions in coastal forests of the south: a review and hypothesis ]\n","341\n","[ The extent to which periodic wildfires, burning in increased forest fuels following severe hurricanes, influenced coastal plain forest ecosystems prior to European settlement is unknown. A review of the literature suggests that, in many forests, conditions after exceptionally strong hurricanes promote the occurrence of fires of higher than normal intensity. While post-hurricane fires have not been prevalent or widespread in recent times in the southern US, a credible line of reasoning plus observations from outside the US supports the hypothesis of a hurricane-fire interaction, particularly in the era before organized fire suppression. The drastic effects caused by strong hurricanes and subsequent fire is likely to have been a significant part of the long-term disturbance regime of many ecosystems. Due to their infrequent occurrence and the difficulties involved in their study, these effects have been overlooked, minimized, or ignored. The hypothesis is presented that a hurricane-fire interaction influenced vegetation in specific ways in the presettlement South. Further, the present-day absence of this process may in part account for the continuing decline of certain plant communities. Opportunities for large-scale restoration of declining communities and ecosystems exist in areas where extensive vegetation change has already come in the form of drastic natural disturbance, such as that caused by severe hurricanes. Land managers may be able to facilitate the long-term process of restoring diverse, fire-maintained ecosystems by using a regime of frequent prescribed fires in areas impacted by strong hurricanes. ]\n","341\n","iteracion 342\n","[ A high resolution estimate of the inorganic nitrogen flux from the Scheldt estuary to the coastal North Sea during a nitrogen-limited algal bloom, spring 1995 ]\n","342\n","[ Massive short-term (4–8 wk) blooms of Phaeocystis have been observed in coastal North Sea waters in the spring for a number of years now.

We demonstrate using the case of a typical heavily polluted macrotidal estuary, the Scheldt in Belgium and the Netherlands, that the short duration of the algal blooms requires estuarine flux estimation methods with a high temporal resolution. We use the fully transient, multicomponent reactive transport model CONTRASTE to compute inorganic nitrogen fluxes through the mouth of the Scheldt estuary into the North Sea. The model simulations use a detailed dataset of upstream river discharges and solute concentrations along with tidal forcings for a 210 day period between December 1, 1994 and June 30, 1995.

Under the Mediterranean climate, some of these lagoons might dry out during summer due to drought events. We propose the term Mediterranean Temporary Lagoons (MTLs) for these ephemeral water bodies and discuss their definition and characteristics. This term emerged in France among its coastal zone managers, who now commonly use it for conservation purposes. It is used in both natural systems as well as most artificial salt ponds in abandoned saltworks. In Europe, two directives have integrated lagoons as key targets to be preserved. Nonetheless, a certain discrepancy in the different definitions of lagoons has constrained joint actions. Indeed, while institutional definitions were originally derived from the scientific concept, their legislative and managerials meanings have been gradually modified and nowadays often differ from the original concept to create difficulties in the field. In addition, while it has been recommended to consider MTLs as a coastal lagoon habitat in the European Habitat Directive, its interpretation among EU member states is unsettled. Thus, clarifying lagoon habitats' terminology is required to ensure better management, monitoring and planning, and coordinate conservation actions.

The sensitivity analysis derive that these results are obtained if the grid electricity price is equal to $3/kW h. From an economic point of view, this study shows that the renewable energy will not be immediately economically viable, even with generous feed-in tariff schemes. In these cases, it is preferable that the grid operator himself makes the investments in the renewable production. To improve the system energy performance, the options should not be focused on the production of renewable electricity, but rather on energy efficiency measures . ]\n","357\n","iteracion 358\n","[ Effects of disturbances caused by coastal constructions on spatial structure, growth dynamics and photosynthesis of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica ]\n","358\n","[ The light-limitation hypothesis was tested to assess whether water turbidity had caused the decline of a Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadow in an area affected by a harbor. The annual growth, photosynthesis and rhizome starch concentrations of seagrass were measured and related to changes in light availability and dissolved nutrient concentration along a gradient of meadow degradation from areas close to the harbor outwards. Environmental and plant variables were measured in three stations placed along this gradient and compared with a reference station at an undisturbed meadow. The light attenuation coefficient ( k ) increased toward the inner harbor area, mainly due to sediment resuspension. The shoot density and leaf productivity of P. oceanica shoots were much lower in disturbed stations of the inner harbor area than in the outer, less disturbed station and the reference meadow. However, daily leaf carbon gains, calculated from the photosynthetic rates at saturating irradiance ( P max ) and the daily period in which seagrass receives light higher than its saturating irradiance ( H sat ), suggested positive C-balance in all stations. This was partly explained by photo-acclimatization of seagrass to the reduced light availability at the disturbed harbor stations (inner and intermediate), as indicated by the lengthening of H sat and the decrease in saturating irradiance ( I sat ) and respiratory demands. Despite photo-acclimatization, disturbed harbor stations showed less positive C-balance, seen not only in their lower leaf growth and biomass but also in a decrease in rhizome carbohydrate reserves (starch). Our results suggest that light reduction account for the reduced seagrass productivity and abundance. However, meadow decline (in terms of shoot mortality) in the harbor area is well above that predicted from similar light environments of nearby meadows or simulated in shading experiments. Thus, there are other factors than light limitation involved in seagrass mortality, most probably through more complex interactions (e.g. nutrient-epiphytes-grazers, water quality––siltation). ]\n","358\n","iteracion 359\n","[ A review of mangrove and coastal ecosystems in West Africa and their possible relationships ]\n","359\n","[ Mangrove forest, which in West Africa covers an area of over 27 000 km 2 of deltas, estuaries and lagoons, is intimately linked to the offshore coastal ecosystem.

Random-systematic line-transect surveys of marine mammals were conducted monthly from August to November 1996, and from May to November 1997–99. CTDs and zooplankton net tows were conducted opportunistically, and at 10 predetermined locations. Hydroacoustic backscatter was measured continuously while underway to estimate prevalence of zooplankton, with emphasis on euphausiids, a key trophic link between primary production and higher trophic level consumers. The occurrences of several of the California Current’s most common cetaceans varied among years. The assemblage of odontocetes became more diverse during the El Niño with a temporary influx of warm-water species. Densities of cold-temperate Dall’s porpoise, Phocoenoides dalli , were greatest before the onset of El Niño, whereas warm-temperate common dolphins, Delphinus spp., were present only during the warm-water period associated with El Niño. Rorqual densities decreased in August 1997 as euphausiid backscatter was reduced. In 1998, as euphausiid backscatter slowly increased, rorqual densities increased sharply to the greatest observed values. Euphausiid backscatter further increased in 1999, whereas rorqual densities were similar to those observed during 1998. We hypothesize that a dramatic reduction in zooplankton biomass offshore during El Niño 1997–98 led to the concentration of rorquals in the remaining productive coastal upwelling areas, including Monterey Bay. These patterns exemplify short-term responses of cetaceans to large-scale changes in oceanic conditions. ]\n","360\n","iteracion 361\n","[ High-resolution sequence stratigraphy of clastic shelves VIII: Full-cycle subaerial unconformities ]\n","361\n","[ Highlights The SU can form during both falling and rising legs of the same cycle of relative sea-level change. The conditions that favor the formation of the SU in high-gradient settings are highlighted. The formation of the SU controlled by regional uplift and glacio-eustasy is not described by classic models. , The interplay between high-frequency relative sea-level changes, such as those connected to late Quaternary glacio-eustasy, and regional uplift usually produces staircases of marine terraces along coastal areas. These particular settings are characterized by variable topography and gradient of the landscape due to both tectonics and wave erosion, which result in the development of subaerial unconformities during both transgressive and forced regressive stages of the high-frequency relative sea-level curve. In particular, the increased topographic gradient due to tectonic uplift results in a coastal profile steeper than the transgressive shoreline trajectory and the consequent formation of a retreating coastal cliff fronted by a transgressive wave ravinement surface, whereas subaerial exposure occurs landwards. In contrast, the relatively low-gradient wave ravinement surface formed during transgression seaward of the coastal cliff affords the deposition of a highstand shallow-marine prograding wedge characterized by a relatively low-gradient top, gentler than the forced regressive shoreline trajectory, resulting in the formation of a new subaerial unconformity at the top of highstand and forced regressive deposits during relative sea-level fall. The overall uplifting conditions favor the persistent development of the already formed transgressive and forced regressive subaerial unconformities also during the highstand and lowstand stages of the high-frequency relative sea-level curve, excepting for the accumulation of continental deposits just seaward of the uplifted paleo-coastal cliffs. The repetition of such a motif for several high-frequency relative sea-level changes will result in the formation of a long-term, higher rank subaerial unconformity expanding seaward and recording the uplift of the coastal area. The way in which the subaerial unconformity develops in contexts dominated by regional uplift and superimposed glacio-eustatic sea-level changes is not described by classic sequence stratigraphic models and this needs to be taken into account in sequence stratigraphic analysis. ]\n","361\n","iteracion 362\n","[ Seasonality in coastal benthic ecosystems ]\n","362\n","[ For historical reasons, knowledge about seasonality in the dynamics of marine benthic suspension feeders from temperate areas comes mainly from studies of cold temperate seas.

Temperature and food availability are crucial to the dynamics of benthic suspension feeders. However, because these factors tend to be positively correlated in cold temperate seas, it is difficult to distinguish between their effects.

Additionally, its semi-enclosed characteristic restricts water exchange, which leads to high accumulation of pollutants in the environment. This overview presents the residues of 6 classes of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), including PAHs, DDTs, HCHs, PCBs and PCDD/Fs, in the sediments and mollusks of the Bohai Sea through analyzing previous literatures. In the sediments, the highest PAH concentrations were detected in the vicinities of Qinhuangdao, while the northeast corner of the Bohai Bay possessed the highest levels of DDTs and PCBs. The investigations on HCHs and PCDD/Fs distributions on the whole sea scale have not been reported. In mollusks, PAH concentrations were in the same order of magnitude in the whole Bohai Sea, so were DDTs, HCHs and PCBs, while the outlier maximum values of PCDDs and PCDFs occurred in Yingkou. In general, the POPs residues in mollusks collected from Shandong Province were higher than the other areas. The compositions of DDTs, HCHs and PCBs in sediments indicated their recent usage. By comparing POP concentrations in sediments with the recommended criterions, it was shown that some individual PAH compounds occasionally associated with adverse biological effects in the vicinities of the Liaodong Bay and Qinhuangdao, and the Liaohe River Estuary were heavily contaminated with DDTs, but PCBs were all below the thresholds. In order to reveal the transference and transformation of POPs in the environment, further studies concerning with their behavior, fate and bioaccumulation in the different trophic levels should be programmed. Moreover, laws and regulations should be enforced to ban the illegal usage of POPs-containing pesticides to guarantee health of the environment and human. ]\n","363\n","iteracion 364\n","[ Sea-level, sediment supply and coastal changes: Examples from the coast of Ireland ]\n","364\n","[ Sediment supply and pre-existing shoreline morphology are crucial factors in controlling coastal changes due to sea-level rise. Using examples from both southeast and northeast Ireland, it can be shown that sea-level change may trigger a sequence of events which leads to both static and dynamic shoreline equilibrium. Cliff erosion and longshore sediment movement in east Co. Wexford has led to injection of sediment onto the shelf, and the growth, under both wave and tide regimes, of linear offshore shoals. These shoals now control the pattern of shoreline erosion and provide a template for possible stepwise evolution of the coast under any future sea-level rise. In contrast, the nearby coast of south Co. Wexford comprises a series of coarse clastic barriers moving monotonously onshore, via overwash processes. Here the behavior of the barrier is conditioned by the antecedent morphology of both the beach face and stream outlet bedforms. Finally, the rock platform coast of Co. Antrim presents a far more resistant shoreline to incident marine processes, yet even here there is strong evidence of present process control over so-called ‘raised’ platforms and embayments. It is concluded that coastal sediment supply and dynamics, together with coastal morphology and its interaction with waves, present a far more complex variety of sea-level indicators than is normally acknowledged. ]\n","364\n","iteracion 365\n","[ Karst geomorphology and related environmental problems in Southern Africa – A review ]\n","365\n","[ Globally many valuable karst resources are under severe threat due to anthropogenic activities.

It further presents the environmental threats and challenges faced by these karst landscapes, their genesis and controlling factors, as well as their possible mitigation and remedial measures. The karst landscapes in the region are most abundant in the interior of the sub-continent, whereas coastal karst is sparsely distributed, and is mainly found in the Eastern and Western Cape, and Kwa-Zulu Natal provinces of South Africa, as well as parts of Namibia. The karst of the interior is largely limited to the Proterozoic dolomitic limestone, while coastal karst is formed in the Tertiary coastal limestone and Quaternary calcareous sandstones . The human impacts threatening karst in southern Africa include mining and mineral extraction, construction and development, agricultural activities, climate change, and changes in the local hydrogeology . Anthropogenic impacts have particularly affected the karst landscape of the Gauteng and northern Free State Provinces of South Africa due to groundwater extraction associated with mining. Changes in land use and water management, consequential to development pressures and a variety of climate change scenarios, are the most significant threats currently facing southern African karst terrain.

This study reviewed the published literature from 1988 to 2021 of India to assess the current status of the data deficient saltmarsh species Porterasia coarctata (Roxb.) within its distribution limits. This saltmarsh species inhabits the lower intertidal silty-sandy habitats of India's west coast and silty-clay habitats of the east coast. In the lower intertidal zone, P. coarctata is mostly associated with Myrostachia wightiana , whereas in the upper intertidal zone the highest chance of presence was for Suaeda maritima (18%) and the lowest for Cressa cretica (1%), S. fruticosa (1%) and Scirpus littoralis (1%). The deep root system of P. coarctata helps in sediment accretion and facilitates the formation of mangrove ecosystems. From this study it was evident that most of the research on P. coarctata in India was part of survey of mangrove ecosystems. In India, significant knowledge gap exists on the reproductive ecology and population trends of this species. Most importantly, the genes responsible for salinity and submergence tolerance of P. coarctata are well documented, that can provide solutions for salt and submergence tolerant rice plants in coastal areas prone to sea level rise . The blue carbon storage potential of P. coarctata is higher than other saltmarsh plants, that can be leveraged as a nature-based solution for CO 2 emission reductions. The ecosystem services of P. coarctata can also contribute towards achieving various sustainable development goals (SDG-1,2,6,13 and14). Coastal development, mangrove restoration and marine food provisioning are the most important drivers causing the decline of P. coarctata ecosystems across India. This study proposes a long-term coastal monitoring plan for essential conservation and management of existing P. coarctata beds and preventing further degradation and loss of these ecosystems.

A set of profiles of apparent electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility was acquired in two sites aiming the identification of geophysical anomalies with potential interest for excavation. To enhance conductivity data, we applied an effective procedure to remove topographical effects in the apparent conductivity measurements, which are rather conditioned by the presence of a variable water table depth or conductive sediment layer. A linear dependence among conductivity values and the site elevation provided a simple linear model to remove the influence of topography. Corrected electric conductivity maps substantially improved the definition of anomalies, many of them rather subtle in raw data images.

The whaling era and modern disposal regulations deeply altered the ecosystem services linked to cetacean strandings. An understanding of carcass ecosystem services within coastal management policies may help preserve their ecological role. Future management could be improved by including zoning, seasonal use limitation and educational outreach. , Ecosystem services associated with cetacean strandings have been altered by humans through exploitation of wild populations during the whaling era and more recently by regulations on carcass management and disposal to abide by environmental health requirements. Here, we systematically review the scientific literature and gather data on cetacean strandings worldwide to: 1) identify the ecosystem services provided by stranded cetacean carcasses in the past and present; 2) estimate the density of cetacean strandings currently occurring in selected coastal areas around the globe, and analyse its association with human population density and regulations; and 3) identify and discuss the regulations and methods concerned with whale carcass disposal in specific regions of the world. Our literature review revealed that stranded cetacean carcasses have provided a rich and varied array of provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ecosystem services to ancient and modern civilisations worldwide. Also, we found that the current density of stranded carcasses (mean: 0.090 strandings year −1 km −1 ; range: 0.001–0.978) and the disposal methods widely varied across the studied regions and countries. In addition, neither human population density nor the existence of regulations were good predictors of stranding densities. Finally, we provide recommendations for the future management of stranded cetacean carcasses, by identifying those disposal methods that minimize costs and maximize ecosystem functions and services. In particular, we encourage natural decomposition in situ whenever possible; otherwise, the present coastal management strategies could be improved by including zoning, seasonal use limitation and educational outreach depending upon the local scenario. Overall, further socio-ecological research is strongly needed to guide stranded cetacean carcass management towards enhancing the net benefits that humans and ecosystems gain from carcasses, especially considering that coastal areas become more populated, new disposal regulations are approved, and cetacean populations are recovering – and thus strandings may become more frequent. ]\n","368\n","iteracion 369\n","[ A comparison between the megafauna communities on the N.W. Iberian and Celtic continental margins—effects of coastal upwelling? ]\n","369\n","[ Megafauna biomass and feeding guilds were studied on the NW Iberian upwelling Continental Margin in order to determine the presence of enriched zones pointing to enhanced particle input. We compare these findings with similar data obtained from a transect across the Celtic Continental Margin that represents a regime without coastal upwelling. Additionally sediment concentrations of phytopigments (chlorophyll-a, phaeophorbides) representing recent inputs of algal production and of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) are used as proxies for microbial biomass, to assess if there was a relation between these parameters and the megafauna distribution. The sediment on the upper slope (&lt;1600 m) of the Iberian Margin was found to be inhabited by filter-feeding megafauna (26–73% of total invertebrate density, and 1–35% of biomass), and contained relatively low levels of phytopigments (3–6 ng/cm 3 chlorophyll-a) and nucleic acids (12–16 μg −1 DNA, 1.5–3.5 μg −1 RNA). In contrast, on the upper slope of the Celtic Margin the dominant component of the megafauna were deposit-feeders (57–92% of total invertebrate density, and 23–90% of biomass) and the sediments contained higher concentrations of phytopigments and nucleic acid. These observations, supplemented by video records revealing the presence of current ripples on the Iberian upper slope, show that these upper slope regions are non-depositional, high energy environments. Conditions at the lower slope and the abyssal plain on the Iberian transect were more quiescent with large deposit-feeding holothurians dominating the megafauna (72–94% of invertebrate biomass), and with relatively high sediment concentrations of phytopigments (7–9 ng/cm 3 chlorophyll-a, 157–170 ng/cm 3 phaeophorbides) and nucleic acids (21–38 μg −1 DNA, 2.4–5.5 μg −1 RNA). On the basis of our data we argue that the benthic food for the deepest stations on the Iberian transect does not consist of shelf derived organic matter. More likely, fast sinking offshore blooms, possibly associated with filaments of upwelling water, form the major contribution to the annual food supply of the deep living megafauna. ]\n","369\n","iteracion 370\n","[ Impacts of earthquakes and tsunamis on marine benthic communities: A review ]\n","370\n","[ Highlights The impacts of earthquakes and tsunami in marine benthic communities are revised.

Meiofaunal communities are less impacted by large-scale disturbance. , Marine communities are dynamic and spatially heterogeneous. Earthquakes and tsunamis modulate the structure of marine communities at short and long-term scales. The objective of this review was to evaluate how such disturbances impact the morphodynamics of coastal areas and the dynamics and structure of marine benthic communities from soft and hard bottoms from intertidal, subtidal and deep-sea habitats. The results reveal that earthquakes and tsunamis caused mortality of algae and bivalves by dissection after coastal uplift.

Recovery of the marine communities to pre-disturbance state occurred by migration and recolonization of impacted habitats. The meiofaunal organisms recovered quickly, while some communities recovered after three years. Information pre-disturbance is often lacking or covers a short temporal extent.

Most of the data were collected from 1985 to 1997 by the Institute of Marine Biology of the Far East Branch of the Russian Academy of Science during expeditions to zones of modern volcanism. Gas‐hydrothermal activity of volcanoes has a great influence on the physicochemical characteristics of the water column and plankton , and of bottom sediment and benthic communities. The abundance of nutrients ( SiO 3 2 − SiO 3 2 − , PO 4 3 − PO 4 3 − , NO 3 − NO 3 − ), gases (CO 2 , CH 4 , H 2 , H 2 S) and other reduced compounds (C n H n , S 0 , S 2 O 3 2 − S 2 O 3 2 − , NH 4 + NH 4 + ) in zones of shallow‐water hydrothermal vents provides conditions for the use of two energy sources for primary production: sunlight (photosynthesis) and the oxidation of reduced compounds (bacterial chemosynthesis). In areas of shallow‐water volcanic activity, chemosynthesis occurs not only in the immediate vicinity of venting fluid release but also in the surface layer of the water column, where it occurs together with intense photosynthesis. This surface photosynthesis is found below the layer of chemosynthesis, which is related to the distribution of hydrothermal fluids at the water surface. The contribution of each of these processes to total primary production depends on the physical and chemical conditions created by the vents and on the range and adaptation potential of the organisms. On the seabed in zones of shallow‐water venting, microorganisms form mats that consist of bacteria of various physiological groups, microalgae, the products of their metabolism and sedimentary particles. Oxygenic photosynthesis of benthic diatoms, bacterial photosynthesis (anoxygenic photosynthesis) and autotrophic chemosynthesis in algobacterial and bacterial mats generate organic matter additional to that produced in the water column. The high rates of primary production, abundance of organic matter in the water column and intense development of benthic microflora ensure the formation of an abundant benthic fauna. In Kraternaya Bight, Matupi Harbour and Bay of Plenty, the macrozoobenthos has low species diversity. The taxonomic composition of the populations is determined by geographical region (temperate or tropical), by the character of the seabed (hard or soft bottoms, rigid lava flows or hydrothermal structures), by the temperature of bottom sediments and of volcanic fluids and lastly by the chemical composition of the vent fluid (sulfide or nonsulfide). In most of the surveyed areas the fauna is derived from locally common species or from opportunistic species that can form high‐density populations in eutrophic waters. The benthic communities of shallow‐water venting areas have many characteristics in common with communities subject to anthropogenic impact (thermal, residential or industrial) or to changes resulting from a sharp deterioration of the marine environment. In contrast to the fauna of deeper water hydrothermal communities (i.e., those that exist below 200 m), shallow‐water venting communities lack obligate hydrothermal species. The structure and function of the pelagic and benthic communities in areas of shallow‐water venting can be regarded as transitional between those of deep‐water vent communities and the normal communities of the coast. ]\n","371\n","iteracion 372\n","[ Advances in estimating Sea Level Rise: A review of tide gauge, satellite altimetry and spatial data science approaches ]\n","372\n","[ Highlights In-situ sea level observation through tide gauges remains the best approach for long-term coastal sea level study.

Wind speed and AEY are quite reliably estimated on offshore and flat onshore sites. Uncertainties are greater on mountainous and particularly on coastal locations. Newer products improvements often lie in pushing accuracy towards higher elevations. Future advances were detected that could be implemented in global reanalysis. , This review critically updates the state of the art on the uncertainties associated with reanalysis data directly used for wind resource assessment. Performances were analysed from 15 (9 global and 6 regional) reanalysis products applied on 322 very heterogeneous locations worldwide. Reanalysis scores were assessed by location type (offshore, coastal, inland and mountainous) and height above the ground (10–300 m). The results confirmed that reanalyses can predict wind resource pattern over time, while they are not similarly able over space. Reanalysis data (particularly by ERA5) are sufficiently reliable on offshore and flat onshore locations. Uncertainties are greater on mountainous and coastal sites, where wind speed and energy yield are significantly under- and over-estimated, respectively. On these locations, the use of higher-resolution regional products should be preferred over global datasets as they are better suited to resolving detailed terrain features as well as roughness and topographical discontinuities. Comparison between older and newer reanalysis versions revealed that the latter do not always outperform the former. In many cases, however, improvements by the newer products were found – rather than in accuracy itself – in pushing a given accuracy towards higher elevations, thus more suitably meeting the needs of modern wind power industry. In perspective, it is desirable that advances in forecasting models will enable current problems in assimilating surface land wind observations by global reanalyses to be overcome. Refinements in global datasets could also positively reflect on regional products. ]\n","378\n","iteracion 379\n","[ Seaweed aquaculture in Bangladesh: Present status, challenges and future prospects ]\n","379\n","[ Highlights Bangladesh coastal waters support over 335 seaweed species. Multidimensional (i.e. environmental, social and economic) challenges for seaweed farming were identified. Seaweed-based new frontiers along with a comprehensive road map were suggested. Action based interventions were proposed in order to promote seaweed industry in Bangladesh. Suitable site selection, value addition and creating market demand are the keys for growth of seaweed industry in Bangladesh. , Seaweeds production can play a significant role in catalyzing sustainable aquaculture activity in many developing countries. Bangladesh has approximately 8500 km 2 (&lt;5 m depth) exploitable coastal area and is home to 335 different types of natural populations of seaweeds, some of which are cultivated on a limited scale due to environmental, technological and socio-economic constraints. Given the current national interest, this study reviewed the previous works as well as collected primary data visiting to seaweed farming sites, and consulting with farmers and relevant stakeholders to better understand the present status of seaweed culture , existing challenges and a possible way forward. A roadmap for seaweed-based new frontiers with necessary interventions is also suggested to promote the seaweed industry in Bangladesh. The strategies to leverage key activities include – (1) zooning of seaweed farming areas, (2) farming intensification and integration, (3) seed bank for commercially important seaweed species, (4) post-harvest management, (5) value-added products and market development, and (6) establishing seaweed-based forward linkage sub-sectors. Overall, the future of seaweed farming in Bangladesh will likely depend upon suitable site selection followed by adaption of improved culture techniques, production volume and market demand. ]\n","379\n","iteracion 380\n","[ Distribution and source identification of Pu in the tidal flat wetlands of northern Jiangsu Province and radial sand ridge of southern Yellow Sea-An explanation of “land-sea interaction” ]\n","380\n","[ Highlights The contribution of Pu from PPG close-in fallout in some samples is 41.5–50%.

Tidal flat wetlands and radial sand ridge are the special sediment deposits in coastal area, which are the ideal places to study “land-sea interaction”. The 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atom ratios in our research samples show that the Pu in most samples is from global fallout, only the Pu in a few samples near Yangtze River Estuary and channel of radial sand ridge is affected by the close-in Pu fallout from Pacific Proving Grounds (PPG), and the contribution of Pu from PPG is 41.5–50%. In composition, since the study samples are mainly sand, the 239+240 Pu activities in our samples are lower than those in river sediments of China. The transport of Pu is a very important scientific issue, and researches have shown that Pu is “transported” into the coastal areas and seas from the land- based “source”.

This ensures coastal resilience and provision of essential ecosystem services, such as wave attenuation reducing coastal flooding and erosion. In the continuum from unvegetated tidal flats to salt marshes and mangroves , fundamental physical controls as well as biotic interactions, and feedbacks among them, determine morphology and vegetation distribution. Although these processes are well described in established literature, this information is rarely applied to understanding the role of these ecosystems as coastal defense. The focus is often on specific elements of the complex system, such as vegetation structure and cover, rather than on their complex natural dynamics. This review examines whether and how the dynamic nature of tidal flat - wetlands systems contributes to, or detracts from, their role in coastal defense. It discusses how the characteristics of the system adjust to external forcing and how these adjustments affect ecosystem services. It also considers how human interventions can take advantage of natural processes to enhance or accelerate achievement of natural coastal defense. ]\n","382\n","iteracion 383\n","[ Mangroves as unique but understudied traps for anthropogenic marine debris: A review of present information and the way forward ]\n","383\n","[ Highlights Mangrove distribution overlaps with areas of severe plastic pollution. Structural features of mangrove forests help them trap marine debris. Marine debris impacts mangroves in unique ways compared to other coastal habitats. Standardised sampling and surveys should be implemented in future studies. More research needed on marine debris to manage and conserve mangroves. , Marine debris and plastic pollution affect all coastal habitats, however coastal debris studies are predominantly performed on sandy beaches. Other coastal habitats, such as mangroves , remain understudied. Eighteen of the top twenty rivers that contribute the most plastic to the ocean are associated with mangroves, but very few of those forests were investigated in terms of plastic debris pollution. Here we discuss the results of the few available studies on macrodebris conducted in mangroves, which show that mangrove debris research is still in its early stages, with many areas of study to be further investigated. Indeed, the distinct structural complexity of mangroves increases their ability to trap debris from both terrestrial, freshwater and marine sources, resulting in impacts unique to the mangrove ecosystem. Our review highlights a significant lack in standardisation across the performed surveys. Here we suggest standardised guidelines for future integrated macrodebris and microplastic studies in mangroves to facilitate comparisons between studies. Such standardisation should prioritize the use of stratified random sampling, the measurement of the area covered by the debris and the abundance and type of macrodebris and microplastics found, in order to assess the ecological impact of macrodebris and its role as source of microplastics for adjacent ecosystems. We also advocate the use of standard categories across studies, based on those identified for surveying other coastal habitats. This review highlights an alarming knowledge gap in extent, sources and overall impacts of marine macrodebris, mainly constituted by plastic, on mangrove forests, which hinders policy making to address this issue. Standardised, reliable and extended research on this aspect of mangrove pollution is needed to manage and protect these endangered vegetated coastal ecosystems . ]\n","383\n","iteracion 384\n","[ Nautical cartography as a tool of international maritime cooperation: some Italian cases in the Mediterranean Sea ]\n","384\n","[ Highlights The Mediterranean Sea is regaining a crucial centrality and its passage is strategic.

It documents the necessity to respect coastal statesʼ cartographic competences in accordance with international law of the sea , but at the same time, it focuses on the need for fruitful cooperation between states with opposite or adjacent coasts. Reminding the main international conventions to protect the freedom of navigation, to regulate maritime spaces and to safeguard the human life at sea, the paper delves into the technical specifications for nautical charting issued by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). Through three case studies in the Mediterranean Sea, it highlights how the hydro-cartographic cooperation may represent a means through which coastal states can play a considerable role from a cartographic perspective, making a noticeable contribution not only to navigation safety, but more generally to establishing mutual collaboration relationships, with win-win solutions for both end users and charts producers. The paper ends with some considerations about the future of nautical charts and an overview of the S-100 data framework that will require, even more, the close partnership among many maritime stakeholders. ]\n","384\n","iteracion 385\n","[ Is the development of desalination compatible with sustainable development of the Arabian Gulf? ]\n","385\n","[ Highlights Desalination in the Arabian Gulf both supports and threatens sustainable development. Impacts of individual desalination plants will combine to cause regional impact. Desalination will adversely impact biodiversity, fisheries, and coastal communities. Desalination will magnify the impact of climate change on the Gulf. Minimising impacts requires behavioural, regulatory, and technological development. , The development of desalination has been essential to the rapid economic development of the countries bordering the Arabian Gulf. The current production capacity of sea water desalination plants drawing water from Gulf is over 20 million m 3 day −1 , which may rise to 80 million m 3 day −1 by 2050. Whilst supporting aspects of sustainable development related to water and sanitation, desalination impacts the marine environment through impingement and entrainment of organisms in intakes, and through thermal, brine and chemical discharges. This may compromise other objectives for sustainable development related to sustainable use of the oceans. Under business as usual scenarios, by 2050, the impact of individual desalination plants will combine causing a regional scale impact. Without mitigating actions to avoid the business as usual scenario, by 2050, desalination in combination with climate change, will elevate coastal water temperatures across more than 50% of the Gulf by at least 3 °C, and a volume of water equivalent to more than a third of the total volume of water between 0 and 10 m deep will pass through desalination plants each year. This will adversely impact the coastal ecosystem of the Gulf, with impacts on biodiversity, fisheries and coastal communities and may cause potential loss of species and habitats from the Gulf. Given the significant implications of these preliminary findings, and in light of the precautionary approach to management, it is recommended that mitigating options addressing behavioural, regulatory and technological change are rapidly evaluated and implemented to avoid the development of desalination in the region along a business as usual pathway, and multidisciplinary research studies should be conducted to reduce uncertainty in predictions of future impacts. ]\n","385\n","iteracion 386\n","[ Variable Impacts of Climate Change on Blue Carbon ]\n","386\n","[ Blue carbon provides opportunities to mitigate climate change while increasing ecosystem services for coastal communities, including climate change adaptation; however, blue carbon ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change, leading to uncertainties in the future efficacy of these ecosystems. In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate change on blue carbon. Despite uncertainties, carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems is enhanced by landward migration of blue carbon habitats, maintenance of sediment supply, restoration, and improved water quality. As an example, landward migration of mangroves could result in carbon sequestration of 1.5 Pg by 2100. Mudflats, seaweed beds, and coastal swamp forests could also contribute to climate change mitigation , although there are large data gaps. Achieving the full potential of blue carbon requires protection and restoration of ecosystems and facilitation of changes in ecosystem distributions with climate change, actions that will also deliver adaptation benefits. Conversely, in the worst-case coastal squeeze scenario, losses of 3.4 Pg of sequestered carbon by 2100 could occur. ]\n","386\n","iteracion 387\n","[ Chapter 2 The Nile Delta: Processes of Heavy Mineral Sorting and Depositional Patterns ]\n","387\n","[ The Nile Delta has a long history of shoreline change . Multiple distributary channels supplied large quantities of sand to the shore, producing beach accretion with extensive black-sand deposits found on the beaches and in continental shelf sands. However, erosion increased as discharges of the river began to decrease in the late 19th century as a result of climate change and construction of dams. The shift from beach accretion to erosion induced a concentration of heavy minerals on stretches of the receding shore, as light minerals were selectively displaced to accretional areas. In this review the physical processes are examined by which waves and currents sort and concentrate the heavy mineral grains according to their densities, sizes and shapes during transport of the beach sand between eroding and accreting shores. As such, the suite of heavy minerals found in delta coastal sands are used as natural tracers of sand movement related to large-scale shoreline change. Results, obtained from several studies undertaken along the length of the Nile Littoral Cell from Alexandria (Egypt) to the northern coast of the northern Israeli and Lebanese margin, are synthesised. These studies illustrate the importance of heavy minerals in identifying sediment point sources, tracing sand transport paths, grain sorting processes, energy levels of transporting agents and sediment provenance (both modern and relict). This contribution also evaluates the potential of applying heavy minerals to discriminate between accreting and eroding beaches and to distinguish a variety of fluvio-marine environments such as river, lagoons, coastal dunes , accretion ridges and continental shelf. ]\n","387\n","iteracion 388\n","[ Recentering the role of marine restoration science to bolster community stewardship ]\n","388\n","[ The restoration of marine habitats is becoming a primary strategy for managing healthy coastal ecosystems , but initiatives often fail due to conflicts with social or industry activities.

This study combines data from the geographic distributions of freshwater fish species, the geological history of the region, and simulations studies of riverine connectivity patterns arising from sea-level fluctuations over the past 10 million years. We identify two main types of paleogeographic events that structured the regional ichthyofauna : uplift of mountains and structural arches by tectonic reactivation of intraplate lineaments (faults), and changes in shorelines (marine transgressions/regressions) due to eustatic sea-level fluctuations. These events altered the courses of large coastal rivers, changed the connectivity patterns within and among rivers basins through river captures at the headwaters and along the coastal plain, and profoundly affected the processes of dispersal, speciation and extinction that produced the unique fish fauna of the Maranhão region. ]\n","389\n","iteracion 390\n","[ Coastal sedimentation in East Sussex during the Holocene ]\n","390\n","[ Lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic evidence is presented which suggests that shoreward movement of sediment, resulting in the formation of a barrier beach, has been the dominant method of accretion in the Eastbourne area, with longshore drift probably being of only secondary importance. A model of coastal evolution for this area has been constructed. It appears that distinct phases of accretion have occurred during the Holocene as well as a change in the type of sediment transported into this area. Originally of silty clay then sand and finally of gravel, a distinct coarsening-upwards in the sedimentary sequence is apparent. A loss of sediment since the 18th century has resulted in the erosion of Eastbourne's beaches. This current episode of erosion may have important implications for land use. The study of Iron Age forest clearance in the Combe Haven valley of East Sussex exemplifies the inter-relationship of sedimentation between river and coastal systems. At the heart of this relationship is the hypothesis that forest clearance resulted in a substantial release of colluvial material, and a concurrent increase in river discharge. Biostratigraphic evidence, supported by radiocarbon dating, suggests that the development of the floodplain in the Combe Haven valley may be directly linked to forest clearance, and that the estuary of this river was modified by the increase in discharge due to reduced evapotranspiration and increased run off, causing a marine incursion into the lower course of the Combe Haven valley. The results from the two areas discussed suggest cyclic erosion phases associated with a change from one sediment type to another. ]\n","390\n","iteracion 391\n","[ Participatory systematic mapping as a tool to identify gaps in ecosystem services research: insights from a Baltic Sea case study ]\n","391\n","[ Highlights The evidence base on ecosystem service research in the Baltic Sea was mapped systematically. 57 publications on marine and coastal ecosystem services were finally selected for review.

This article presents a participatory systematic map, which constitutes a relatively new methodological approach in the field of ecosystem services (ES) research. The map identifies, collates, and describes the evidence base on marine and coastal ES research in the Baltic Sea. Key stakeholders were involved throughout the whole mapping process. 1006 publications, identified through searches in eleven databases, were double-screened and 57 publications were found eligible. The results show that research on provisioning, regulating and cultural ES is uniformly distributed in the evidence base while most studies applied bio-physical assessment approaches. The most frequently researched ES are the regulation of nutrients, the provision of fish, and recreation. Only a few studies were conducted in the context of marine policies. While ES research is growing in the Baltic Sea area, this systematic map highlights the plethora of definitions and lack of standardized approaches as an obstacle for policy implementation. The method of participatory systematic mapping was identified as a useful tool for ES research to identify all available knowledge on a specific topic, determine knowledge gaps and inform both researchers and policy makers. ]\n","391\n","iteracion 392\n","[ The near-surface dynamics of coastal upwelling ]\n","392\n","[ An attempt is made to examine some observational and theoretical aspects of upper ocean dynamics in regions of strong coastal upwelling. “Upper ocean” is roughly defined as about the upper 10–30 m of the water column for most systems.

Cities in the PRD are vitally important to China in relation to their socio-economic contributions. From recent evidence, this strongly urbanized area is vulnerable to, and currently facing bigger incidences of, coastal and urban flooding. Flood risk is growing in low-lying coastal areas due to rapid urbanization and increasing flood hazards exacerbated by climate change. Frequent intensive rainstorms, sea-level rise, typhoons and surges threaten large populations and their economic assets, causing severe socio-economic and ecological impacts in the PRD cities. Current flood risk management (FRM) in the delta is still predominately focused on using traditional techno-fixes and infrastructure paradigms, lacking sufficient strategic planning and flood protection to develop adequate flood resilience.

These studies have documented a variety of characteristic sedimentary and erosional features that can be ascribed to known events. Nevertheless, the question arises whether these structures are just ephemeral or have a potential to be preserved in the geological record . This review describes the changes that have affected muddy to sandy siliciclastic tsunami deposits in Peru. Each of these was surveyed in the first months after the tsunami: Chimbote (1996), Camaná (2001) and Pisco-Paracas (2007). Here, we describe the changes we observed during re-surveys in 2007 and 2008. It has long been recognized that onshore tsunami deposits may suffer from surficial processes, tectonic movements and anthropogenic alteration. Earthquake-induced uplift or subsidence may subject a tsunami deposit to erosion or burial, respectively. Quick burial in rapidly subsiding coastal areas may enhance preservation. Deposits of the last or most landward-reaching wave may be preferentially preserved if they escape erosion by subsequent tsunami waves ; however, inland areas are also vulnerable to subaerial reworking, including by wind and by humans. The Peruvian examples reviewed here show that the preservation of arid-coast tsunami deposits depends on interactions that are more complex that hitherto perceived. These involve sediment type, grain size, depositional setting, co-seismic movement, bioturbation , winds, and anthropogenic modification. In one example, all traces of the tsunami have been removed or reworked by flash floods and ocean waves. In another example, clasts on a coastal plain from tsunami-backwash began to be rounded and abraded by eolian sands immediately after the event. Eolian processes also smoothed and filled tsunami scours. By contrast, muddy tsunami deposits in certain areas escaped erosion by wind, probably because of their greater cohesion. In still another example, 0.5 m of co-seismic uplift was not enough to prevent ocean waves from removing a tsunami sand sheet that had mantled a coastal marsh. The buried record of tsunami deposits on modern coasts may therefore not fully represent the vulnerability of these regions to tsunamigenic hazards. ]\n","398\n","iteracion 399\n","[ Tsunamis caused by offshore active faults and their deposits ]\n","399\n","[ This paper reviews the variable features of coastal tsunamis caused by offshore active faults along the eastern margin of the Japan Sea (EMJS) based on the historical records and modern observations of earthquakes and tsunamis. Tsunami deposits discovered along the EMJS coast were also introduced and categorized depending on their sedimentary environments . The offshore active faults, which are densely distributed along the EMJS and generate tsunamis, are originated from the opening of the Japan Sea back-arc basin during the late Oligocene to Miocene period. The magnitudes of the earthquakes that caused large tsunamis in the EMJS were under 8.0. The size of the fault plane (approximately equal to the tsunami source area) was approximately 10 × 100 and several tens of kilometers in length. The slip distance of the reverse-type faults was less than 20 m. The sedimentary characteristics and depositional processes of tsunami deposits were obtained from deposits in various environments, such as coastal lowlands, marine terraces , coastal lagoons , and inland ponds. Certain unique approaches used to identify tsunami deposits were reviewed, such as gravel layers that intercalate inorganic soils, and a Holocene marine terrace, dinoflagellate cysts , and foraminiferal linings, which are potentially derived from the sea, and chemical features (e.g., the Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ ratio) as indicators of seawater inflow into a coastal lagoon. The spatial distribution and recurrence of earthquakes and tsunamis in the EMJS were found based on previous paleo-tsunami studies. The difference between tsunami deposits caused by offshore active faults and those by megathrust earthquakes only manifests itself in the horizontal and vertical directions, but not in the sedimentary environments and structures. The data thus inferred can be used for the estimation of offshore active fault models and validation of previous tsunami disaster reconstructions in the future. ]\n","399\n","iteracion 400\n","[ Ecosystem health and human wealth – A comparison of sub-Saharan African Large Marine Ecosystems ]\n","400\n","[ Sub-optimal levels of ocean health were determined for four sub-Saharan African Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs), based on Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Transboundary Waters Assessment Program (TWAP) assessments. Various ecosystem health and pollution indices that were considered reflect coastal degradation that is ubiquitous in many areas of these LMEs, such as pollution, eutrophication , and widespread loss and modification of coastal habitats including mangroves , estuaries , lagoons , and corals. The Guinea Current LME (GCLME), which has the highest coastal population of the four LMEs, was found to have the greatest cumulative human impact and the highest nutrient and pollution levels, associated with agricultural, industrial and domestic wastes. A large percentage of the GCLME's coastal population is rural, and with fishing as a major livelihood and a high dependence on fish protein, the LME is most at risk of overexploitation . A highly inequitable distribution of economic development and wealth was evident in each LME, but the socio-economic vulnerability of the GCLME and Agulhas Current LME (ACLME) are considered to be the highest of the four LMEs, because of the high numbers of poor people among their coastal populations. Based on the Human Development Index that takes into account factors such as life expectancy, education and income, the Somali Coastal Current LME (SCCLME) was the most vulnerable of the four LMEs to external events such as disease or extreme climate related events, due to less than perfect human health, education and income levels.

This requires effective transboundary governance, but in this regard the GCLME, ACLME and SCCLME are lagging behind the Benguela Current LME (BCLME), where the establishment of the Benguela Current Commission and subsequent signing of the Benguela Current Convention have facilitated high-level engagement by the governments, and provided for full integration across transboundary issues in the component EEZs. Continued and enhanced monitoring will be essential for assessing and understanding impacts of threats and the effectiveness of conservation efforts, and initiation of new in situ monitoring should be considered in combination with models, where applicable. ]\n","400\n","iteracion 401\n","[ Distribution of microplastics in soil and freshwater environments: Global analysis and framework for transport modeling ]\n","401\n","[ Highlights Microplastic concentration in river and farmlands can vary up to 8 orders of magnitude. Concentration between inland and coastal areas decreases by a factor of 1000. Biodegradation of microplastics in long term can change the concentration. Fibers are preferentially transported and enriched in coastal areas. Transport modeling with non-spherical microplastics is lacking. , Microplastics are continuously released into the terrestrial environment from sources where they are used and produced. These microplastics accumulate in soils, sediments, and freshwater bodies, and some are conveyed via wind and water to the oceans. The concentration gradient between terrestrial inland and coastal regions, the factors that influence the concentration, and the fundamental transport processes that could dynamically affect the distribution of microplastics are unclear. We analyzed microplastic concentration reported in 196 studies from 49 countries or territories from all continents and found that microplastic concentrations in soils or sediments and surface water could vary by up to eight orders of magnitude. Mean microplastic concentrations in inland locations such as glacier (191 n L −1 ) and urban stormwater (55 n L −1 ) were up to two orders of magnitude greater than the concentrations in rivers (0.63 n L −1 ) that convey microplastics from inland locations to water bodies in terrestrial boundary such as estuaries (0.15 n L −1 ). However, only 20% of studies reported microplastics below 20 μm, indicating the concentration in these systems can change with the improvement of microplastic detection technology. Analysis of data from laboratory studies reveals that biodegradation can also reduce the concentration and size of deposited microplastics in the terrestrial environment. Fiber percentage was higher in the sediments in the coastal areas than the sediments in inland water bodies, indicating fibers are preferentially transported to the terrestrial boundary. Finally, we provide theoretical frameworks to predict microplastics transport and identify potential hotspots where microplastics may accumulate. ]\n","401\n","iteracion 402\n","[ Loss and damage implications of sea-level rise on Small Island Developing States ]\n","402\n","[ Highlights Climate change is inflicting economic and non-economic loss and damage in small islands states today.

Wide variety of methods are used - standardization of protocols is needed. , The dispersion of microplastics (MPs) in coastal and marine environments and their potential harmful effects on organisms and ecosystems makes MPs pollution an emerging problem that has gained increasing attention from the scientific community. Despite the recent increase in the number of studies on MPs presence in different marine environments, investigations in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are still relatively limited. This review presents the spatial distribution (where) and the methods applied (how) in assessing MPs contamination on LAC sandy beaches, identifying the challenges to be faced in advancing the understanding of this emerging contaminant . Most of the 39 papers reviewed were published between 2020 and 2021 (51%) and conducted on Brazilian beaches (43%). The LAC investigations apply spot sampling (69%) on shoreline stretches between 10 and 1000 km (59%). These works used inconsistent sampling methods, incomparable techniques for MPs extraction from sediments, and different measurement units to report their data. The MPs presence on LAC beaches is not negligible, as it varies significantly in its distribution and concentration (0–2457 MP/dw kg and 0–5458 MP/m 2 ). Its highest accumulation is on ocean island beaches; however, there are still large stretches of coastline (Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina) with no data on MPs presence and a small number of studies exploring these contaminants' temporal variability. The lack of standardization in the studies’ methodologies, particularly their measurement units, hinders their quantitative comparison and our ability to establish baseline values regarding MPs abundance on LAC beaches. In this sense, future works should direct efforts towards the spatial and temporal expansion of their sampling, as well as protocol standardization to facilitate result comparability on MPs on LAC sandy beaches. ]\n","403\n","iteracion 404\n","[ Litter and plastic monitoring in the Indian marine environment: A review of current research, policies, waste management, and a roadmap for multidisciplinary action ]\n","404\n","[ Highlights Limited studies exist on litter and plastic from the Indian marine system.

TBT is a possible human health stressor, endocrine disruptor and obesogen. , Tributyltin (TBT) was widely used as a highly efficient biocide in antifouling paints for ship and boat hulls. Eventually, TBT containing paints became globally banned when TBT was found to cause widespread contamination and non-target adverse effects in sensitive species, with induced pseudohermaphroditism in female neogastropods (imposex) being the best-known example. In this review, we address the history and the status of knowledge regarding TBT pollution and marine TBT hotspots, with a special emphasis on the Norwegian coastline. The review also presents a brief update on knowledge of TBT toxicity in various marine species and humans, highlighting the current understanding of toxicity mechanisms relevant for causing endocrine disruption in marine species. Despite observations of reduced TBT sediment concentrations in many marine sediments over the recent decades, contaminant hotspots are still prevalent worldwide. Consequently, efforts to monitor TBT levels and assessment of potential effects in sentinel species being potentially susceptible to TBT in these locations are still highly warranted. ]\n","405\n","iteracion 406\n","[ Ocean Deoxygenation: A Primer ]\n","406\n","[ Earth’s ocean is losing oxygen; since the mid-20 th century, 1%–2% of the global ocean oxygen inventory has been lost, and over 700 coastal sites have reported new or worsening low-oxygen conditions.

Oxygen is fundamental for life and biogeochemical processes in the ocean. In coastal and shelf regions and semi-enclosed seas, over-fertilization of waters largely from agriculture, sewage, and airborne sources creates algal blooms that die and decay, consuming oxygen. Globally, climate warming both exacerbates the problems from eutrophication and reduces the introduction of oxygen to the interior of the ocean.

Many of these (termed ‘microbialites’) calcified as they grew but such lithified mats are rare along modern coasts for reasons such as unsuitable water chemistry, destructive metazoan influences and competition with other reef-builders such as corals or macroalgae . Nonetheless, extant microbialites occur in unique coastal ecosystems such as the Exuma Cays , Bahamas or Lake Clifton and Hamelin Pool, Australia, where limitations such as calcium carbonate availability or destructive bioturbation are diminished. Along the coast of South Africa, extensive distributions of living microbialites (including layered stromatolites) have been discovered and described since the early 2000s. Unlike the Bahamian and Australian ecosystems, the South African microbialites form exclusively in the supratidal coastal zone at the convergence of emergent groundwater seepage . Similar systems were documented subsequently in southwestern Australia, Northern Ireland and the Scottish Hebrides, as recently as 2018, revealing that supratidal microbialites have a global distribution. This review uses the best-studied formations to contextualise formative drivers and processes of these supratidal ecosystems and highlight their geological, ecological and societal relevance. Dynamic interchanges between salinity states both exclude many destructive metazoans and competitors and provides optimal nutrient conditions for benthic microbial and microalgal growth. The outflowing groundwater seeps are alkaline and rich in calcium carbonate , which reflects local catchment geological processes . These habitats support a diverse microbial community dominated by Cyanobacteria as well as some metazoan species previously unknown to science, or unknown for the region. Several taxa (from invertebrates to fish) utilise this environment as refugia .

Active upwelling appears to be restricted to a narrow coastal band (about 10–25 km wide) along the entire coast, but the region influenced by coastal upwelling may be much wider. Intensive observations of the upwelling zone during summer off Oregon show the presence of a southward coastal jet at the surface, a mean vertical shear, a poleward undercurrent along the bottom, and persistently sloping isopycnals over the continental shelf; most of the upwelling there occurs during relatively short periods (several days long) of upwelling-favorable winds. During the upwelling season off Oregon, the offshore Ekman transport is carried by the surface Ekman layer, and the onshore return flow occurs through a quasi-geostrophic interior. It is not known whether the structure and dynamics observed off Oregon are typical of the upwelling zone along the entire coast, though some of the same features have been observed off Baja California.

The study addresses Quaternary and pre-Quaternary landforms used as ore guides. Geoscientific data to distinguish aeolian from coastal marine and fluvial environments . It addresses aeolian deposits as to their geomorphological-geodynamic maturity. It addresses aeolian deposits as a function of the climate zones. It constrains the physical–chemical regime of aeolian deposits by marker minerals. , Quaternary aeolian landforms (AL) can convert into aeolian mineral deposits of economic grade through concentration of metals (Ti, Fe, Zr, Sn, REE, Au, PGE), industrial minerals (silica) and gems (diamonds), purification (winnowing) of trash minerals (feldspar, mica) and the provision of accommodation space for uranium and base metals. Therefore, during the study of aeolian deposits (AD), emphasis is placed on the mineral assemblage, chemical composition and numerical data obtained from sedimentology to constrain the potential of accumulating mineral commodities. The physical–chemical regime of AL and AD is characterized by alkaline to neutral fluids and oxidizing conditions during the early stages of deposition. An acidic fluid regime evolves from it during late-stage supergene alteration when reducing conditions are created in fossil dunes and the likelihood of sulfide accumulation gets improved. The climate zones have a strong impact on the sorting of the AD causing different types of vegetation and degrees of wetness, more pronounced in the inland than coastal AL. This is also valid for grain sphericity, the chemical (Ti/Fe ratio) and mineralogical composition (carbonate/ silicate ratio). Chemical residues (e.g. carbocretes, sulcretes) in the fine-grained and clay minerals in coarser-grained fraction are more widespread in arid/semiarid and dry continental climate zones which are the aeolian active ones. Neighboring ones such as the wet-and-dry or humid-mid-latitude climate zones are typical of fossil inland AL and dominated by fluvial environments. With the aid of the trend analyses and composite x-y plots using HM, chemical markers, and sedimentological parameters the aeolian facies can be distinguished from fluvial and coastal environments. The source of the AD is related to the geodynamic setting and the tripartite subdivision into pre-mature, mature and supermature crustal section forms the basis for the classification of AL and AD. HM and chemical markers allow for a attribution of AD to mantle (Cu, Ni, Cr) and crustal (Zr) lithologies. In conclusion, mapping AL and investigating AD using the afore-mentioned parameters can be used as an ore guide and help delineate aeolian mineral deposits. The ore-forming aeolian processes may be subdivided into (1) concentration (light and heavy mineral placers), (2) purification (heavy mineral placers), (3) provision of accommodation space (uranium and base metal deposits). ]\n","410\n","iteracion 411\n","[ Tsunami risk communication and management: Contemporary gaps and challenges ]\n","411\n","[ Very large tsunamis are associated with low probabilities of occurrence. In many parts of the world, these events have usually occurred in a distant time in the past. As a result, there is low risk perception and a lack of collective memories, making tsunami risk communication both challenging and complex. Furthermore, immense challenges lie ahead as population and risk exposure continue to increase in coastal areas. Through the last decades, tsunamis have caught coastal populations off-guard, providing evidence of lack of preparedness. Recent tsunamis, such as the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004, 2011 Tohoku and 2018 Palu, have shaped the way tsunami risk is perceived and acted upon.

The important lessons provided by the past events call for strengthening community resilience and improvement in risk-informed actions and policy measures. This paper shows that research efforts related to tsunami risk communication remain fragmented. The analysis of tsunami risk together with a thorough understanding of risk communication gaps and challenges is indispensable towards developing and deploying comprehensive disaster risk reduction measures.

The location of mangroves close to densely populated coastlines, on the other hand, puts them in a perilous situation as socio-economic growth has intensified in the past decades. Thus, research to support conservation of remnant mangroves is urgently required. Critical information is, however, spread across numerous disciplines. Here, we use a range of sources to gain multidisciplinary inputs from as much literature as possible to summarize emerging trends for driving future research to support conservation. This narrative review begins by pointing out the unique values of the biophysical and ecosystem services of Sundaic mangroves. Subsequently, the human beneficiaries of the mangroves are explored, including indigenous sea-people who are rarely mentioned in the literature.

SSSCHs are: shelf-edge progradational coastal systems; continental shelf, shoal-water coastal systems; coast-disconnected. Local process-regime changes control the amount and type of sediment delivered to canyons from the different SSSCHs. Sea-level variations are the main drivers of SSSCHs’ evolution; their effects influence different systems at different times. The geology and physiography of the margins are also important in setting the character and the timing of SSSCHs. High-frequency perturbations, such as climate changes at a variety of temporal scales, have a large impact on SSSCHs. The results emphasize that process-based approaches are chief practices in the study of continental margin stratigraphy. SSSCHs are a principal archive of environmental changes, and of perturbation signals in a source-to-sink perspective. , Systems Supplying Sediment to Canyon or Slope Channel Heads (SSSCHs) initiate sediment transfer from the shallow water areas to the deep sea. SSSCHs are very sensitive to sea-level variations, to perturbations in sediment production and redistribution and to variations in accommodation in the shelf. Through the analysis of bathymetric and subbottom data, I review the variability in time and space of SSSCHs in the eastern Sardinian and northeastern Sicilian margins of the Tyrrhenian Sea. I distinguish three main types of SSSCHs: type I corresponds to shelf-edge deep-water coastal systems; type II corresponds to continental shelf , shoal-water coastal systems; type III is coast-disconnected. Further subdivisions involve the degree of confinement and the process-regime at the shelf-edge for Type I SSSCHs, and the distance from the canyon head and the process-regime for type II SSSCHs. Coast-disconnected type III SSSCHs consist of shelf-wide depositional belts, both un-channalised and channalised, as well as of landslide complexes. Each of the different SSSCHs has its distinct process-regime, which regulates its capability of sediment transfer to the canyons or channels and eventually to the deep-sea. SSSCHs of type IA and IB develop coastal bodies at the shelf-edge, which store part of the sediment budget . Type IC SSSCHs exhibit a direct connection between a river and a canyon, leading to shelf-edge sediment bypass; direct hyperpycnal discharge and landslides result in the largest efficiency in transferring sediment to the deep sea. The efficiency of type II SSSCHs depends mainly on their distance from the canyon head and on the ability of hyperpycnal flows, both from plunging river-floods and from wave resuspension , and storm waves, in transporting sediment offshore. Type IIC SSSCHs, consisting of tide-dominated shorelines , play a minor role in the study area due to the microtidal regime of the Mediterranean Sea. Type IIIA SSSCHs are also rare, since they correspond to shelf-wide depositional belts, that in the study area only seldom are able to reach the canyon heads. Type IIIB SSSCHs, corresponding to landslide complexes, also have a restricted frequency but can contribute a large amount of sediment to the deep-sea. Sea-level variations have the largest influence on SSSCH evolution along the two margins of the study area. Type I prevails during the falling-stage and the lowstansd of sea level. They are however, also active during the present sea-level highstand in the tectonically active Sicilian margin. Type II SSSCHs dominate the TST but their activation is diachronous, being dependent also on inherited margin physiography. The present review highlights the large spectrum of processes that contribute to sediment supply to canyon or slope channels heads. As a result, the complexity of the initial part of the marine tract of the source to sink system that transports sediment from the shallow-to the deep-sea is uncovered. While stressing the role of the previous evolution of a margin, of tectonic activity, and of climate variations , the present review acknowledges the importance of sea-level variations as a control on SSSCH development. It however shows that the complexity of the sedimentary processes that rules the transfer of sediment to the deep-sea results in times of activity during a cycle of sea-level variations, and consequent depositional histories, which do not conform with those predicted by the sequence stratigraphic models. ]\n","414\n","iteracion 415\n","[ Changing Coastal oceanography of the Black Sea. I: Northwestern Shelf ]\n","415\n","[ This article describes the hydrography of the Northwestern Shelf (NWS), of the Black Sea emphasizing the changes induced by water management in the Dniejer and Dniester river basins. The existing literature and previously unpublished data have been reviewed and synthesized to describe water property fields and transport mechanisms of the NWS and the Dnieper and Dniester estuaries before the early 1960s, or the so-called precontrol period, when the effect of artificial river flow control upon the coastal waters was insignificant. After the hydroenergy complexes and water withdrawal and disposal systems on rivers became fully operational in the early 1970s (the so-called postcontrol period), the annual river discharge from the Dnieper and Dniester had noticeably decreased and seasonal river flow patterns had been artificially modified. Instead of a powerful and short early spring flood, typical for the natural conditions in the Dnieper river, the hydrographs in the postcontrol period exhibit two smaller peaks of river discharge of much longer period. One of them (winter-early spring) is caused by intense hydroenergy generation and weir discharges through the cascade of storage reservoirs. Another is associated with spring flood, modified by intense water consumption and storage in this period. High average river discharge in late May—early June strengthened the summer pycnocline which inhibits vertical mixing in the estuaries and coastal waters. Owing to a slow summer circulation, the rate of natural purification of the entire coastal system has been reduced. This coupled with the increased nutrient, organic and pollutant transport, decreased the dissolved-oxygen concentration and led to anoxic events and mass mortalities of marine organisms in the previously productive regions. These effects have primarily plagued the benthic communities along the entire western coast of the NWS since 1973. Winter convective overturn in the Black Sea reaches its maximum depth at the southern boundary of the NWS. Thus, the NWS waters descend beneath the seasonal and main thermoclines in the open sea and are spread by the prevailing currents across the entire sea in the cold intermediate layer (CIL). By this dynamic mechanism the projected man-made modifications in the riverine-estuarine systems of the NWS will affect and change the large-scale thermohaline structure and marine life of the Black Sea. ]\n","415\n","iteracion 416\n","[ Plastic pollution in the marine environment ]\n","416\n","[ Plastic pollution is recognized as a severe anthropogenic issue in the coastal and marine ecosystems across the world. Unprecedented and continuous accumulation of growing plastic contaminants into any respective aquatic ecosystem by the anthropogenic sources causes direct and/or indirect interruption to ecosystem structure, functions, and consequently, services and values. Land-based and sea-based sources are the primary sources of these contaminants in various modes that enter the ocean. In this review paper, we focused on highlighting different aspects related to plastic pollution in coastal and marine environments. Plastic pollutants are distributed in the ecosystems in different forms, with different size variations as megaplastic, macroplastic, mesoplastic, and microplastic . Microplastics in primary and secondary forms reveal a widespread distribution in the water, sediment, and biota of the marine and coastal habitats. The microplastic level of different coastal and marine ecosystems nearly ranged from 0.001-140 particles/m 3 in water and 0.2-8766 particles/m 3 in sediments at different aquatic environments over the world. The microplastic accumulation rate of coastal and marine organisms varied at 0.1-15,033 counts. Accordingly, plastic pollution creates several kinds of negative consequences combined with ecological and socio-economic effects. Entanglement , toxicological effects via ingestion of plastics, suffocation , starvation, dispersal, and rafting of organisms, provision of new habitats, and introduction of invasive species are significant ecological effects with growing threats to biodiversity and trophic relationships . Degradation (changes in the ecosystem state) and modifications of marine systems are associated with loss of ecosystem services and values. Consequently, this emerging contaminant affects the socio-economic aspects through negative impacts on tourism, fishery, shipping, and human health. Preventing accumulation sources of plastic pollutants, 3Rs (Reduce-Recycle-Reuse), awareness &amp; capacity building, and producer/manufacturer responsibility are practical approaches toward addressing the issue of plastic pollution. Existing and adopted policies, legislations, regulations, and initiatives at global, regional, and national level play a vital role in reducing plastic debris in the marine and coastal zones. Development of proposals/solutions on key research gaps can open a novel pathway to address this environmental issue in an effective scientific manner. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the current status of plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem to make aware people of a plastic-free, healthy blue ocean in the near future. ]\n","416\n","iteracion 417\n","[ A review of the threat of oil exploitation to mangrove ecosystem: Insights from Niger Delta, Nigeria ]\n","417\n","[ Highlights Limited mangrove conservation knowledge exists in coastal communities in Nigeria.

Six of the 15 issues primarily affect marine or coastal ecosystems and seven are related to human and ecosystem-level responses to anthropogenic climate change. Other emerging issues include complete coverage of Indian states for sustainable farming and the potential for use of self-healing building materials. , We present the results from our 12th annual horizon scan of issues likely to impact biological conservation in the future. From a list of 97 topics, our global panel of 25 scientists and practitioners identified the top 15 issues that we believe society may urgently need to address. These issues are either novel in the biological conservation sector or represent a substantial positive or negative step-change in impact at global or regional level. Six issues, such as coral reef deoxygenation and changes in polar coastal productivity, affect marine or coastal ecosystems and seven relate to human and ecosystem-level responses to climate change. Identification of potential forthcoming issues for biological conservation may enable increased preparedness by researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers. ]\n","418\n","iteracion 419\n","[ Palaeotsunami deposits at the Tiber River mouth (Ostia Antica, Italy): Do they really exist? ]\n","419\n","[ In this paper, we test the recent hypothesis of the occurrence of five to seven tsunami generations, that would have struck the ancient harbour basin of Ostia (Italy), and the lower channel of the Tiber River during the last three millennia. Because these steady disaster events would have deep implications on our knowledge of the history of Rome, we reviewed the pluridisciplinary data available at the Tiber River mouth. Considering sedimentological, geomorphological, micropalaeontological, geochemical, chronological and historical evidence, there is currently no conclusive palaeoenvironmental evidence to suggest past tsunami inundations near Ostia . River mouths are not the best context in which to identify tsunami deposits . High fluvial and coastal mobility generated by regular floods and storms hardly record single High-Energy Events (HEE) from floods, storms, or tsunamis. Sediments are regularly reworked at the river mouth both in the river channel and on the close shoreface. Mixed fluvial and marine influences and the seasonal formation of a salt wedge at the mouth of the Tiber create specific estuarine assemblages for micro- and macrofauna . The layer called High-Energy Event 1 (HEE-1) on the palaeo-shoreface close to the river mouth and HEE-4/5 in the point bars of the Tiber channel are most probably layers reworked several times by fluvio-coastal events (storms and/or floods). HEE-3 sealing the Republican harbour of Ostia is clearly related to flood deposits. Complementary analyses would be necessary to definitively identify the origins of the HEE-2 and HEE-7 in the harbour, and HEE-6 in the palaeochannel or floodplain. Based on the data available, we show how other processes than tsunami inundations could be just as accountable for these coarse-grained sediment layers (storm deposit, flood deposit, or riverbank deposit). This review puts into question the use of pluridisciplinary proxies to identify palaeotsunami deposits. In addition, we demonstrate how high Pb concentrations constitute a robust proxy to definitively refute the presence of palaeotsunami deposits. As such, this study will be beneficial to a large community of specialists in coastal research. ]\n","419\n","iteracion 420\n","[ Impacts of the dam-orientated water-sediment regulation scheme on the lower reaches and delta of the Yellow River (Huanghe): A review ]\n","420\n","[ Highlights Datasets over 2002–2013 provides a comprehensive review on how dam regulation impacts the lower Yellow River and its delta. WSRS changed the natural seasonal hydrological rhythm through the artificial flood and the associated sediment delivery. Both sediment source and grain-size composition differs greatly between the two phases of WSRS. WSRS alters the nutrients delivery to the sea, and significantly impacts the coastal biogeochemical process and ecosystem. , The water-sediment regulation scheme (WSRS), beginning in 2002, is an unprecedented engineering effort to manage the Yellow River with the aims to mitigate the siltation both in the lower river channel and within the Xiaolangdi Reservoir utilizing the dam-regulated flood water. Ten years after its initial implementation, multi-disciplinary indicators allow us to offer a comprehensive review of this human intervention on a river-coastal system. The WSRS generally achieved its objective, including bed erosion in the lower reaches with increasing capacity for flood discharge and the mitigation of reservoir siltation. However, the WSRS presented unexpected disturbances on the delta and coastal system. Increasing grain size of suspended sediment and decreasing suspended sediment concentration at the river mouth resulted in a regime shift of sediment transport patterns that enhanced the disequilibrium of the delta. The WSRS induced an impulse delivery of nutrients and pollutants within a short period (~ 20 days), which together with the altered hydrological cycle , impacted the estuarine and coastal ecosystem . We expect that the sediment yield from the loess region in the future will decrease due to soil-conservation practices, and the lower channel erosion will also decrease as the riverbed armors with coarser sediment. These, in combination with uncertain water discharge concomitant with climate change, increasing water demands and delta subsidence , will put the delta and coastal ocean at high environmental risks. In the context of global change, this work depicts a scenario of human impacts in the river basin that were transferred along the hydrological pathway to the coastal system and remotely transformed the different components of coastal environment. The synthesis review of the WSRS indicates that an integrated management of the river-coast continuum is crucially important for the sustainability of the entire river-delta system. The lessons learned from the WSRS in the Yellow River provide insights to the integrated management of large rivers worldwide. ]\n","420\n","iteracion 421\n","[ Electrochemical monitoring of marine nutrients: From principle to application ]\n","421\n","[ Highlights Main parameters assessed in studies published in last five decades are reviewed.

Downstream riverbed erosion is a dominant source of POC to the coastal margin. Dam regulation has substantially transformed the POC delivery during the WSRS. , The Yellow River has changed into a highly dam-controlled system over the recent decades. Based on gauging records of water-sediment discharge and particulate organic carbon (POC) datasets, this paper investigates the dam impacts on spatio-temporal variability of hydrology and POC transport. With a large part of suspended sediment and POC normally preserved within the Xiaolangdi (XLD) reservoir, erosion of riverbed downstream the reservoir has now become a primary source of sediment and POC to coastal ocean (172 Mt/yr for sediment and 0.56 Mt/yr for POC, respectively). Sediment accumulation and POC burial within the XLD reservoir are 246 Mt/yr and 0.60 Mt/yr, respectively, globally accounting for ∼10% and ∼1% of the retentions in reservoirs. Downstream the XLD reservoir, the averaged Δ 14 C values of POC was −451 ± 25‰, corresponding to a 14 C age of 4763 ± 366 yr BP, indicating that the POC in the lower reaches of the Yellow River was ∼2400 yr younger than that in the Loess Plateau region where most of the sediment and POC are sourced. Petrogenic POC fluxes upstream and downstream the XLD dam were 0.12 Mt/yr and 0.06 Mt/yr, respectively, clearly indicative of large-scale trapping of petrogenic POC by the XLD dam. At present, the XLD dam regulation intercepts this petrogenic POC from the Loess Plateau and enhances the downstream input of biospheric POC ( Fm = 0.85) to the coast. In contrast to the sediment and POC delivery of the rivers worldwide that are primarily dominated by tectonic, climatic and geographic settings, human activities, especially the dam regulation in the Yellow River, have significantly altered river hydrologic regime and overwhelmed the sediment and POC delivery within the river-coast continuum, which has profound impacts on carbon cycling in the coastal margin. ]\n","422\n","iteracion 423\n","[ Invasion and ecological effects of exotic smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora in China ]\n","423\n","[ Smooth cordgrass ( Spartina alterniflora ) was introduced to China in December 1979 to buffer against tides and to accelerate coastal wetland accretion.

Salt marshes in China face natural and anthropogenic threats. China has taken even tougher measures to conserve and restore salt marshes. Legal basis for wetland protection, more effective enforcement and public participation are needed. , Coastal salt marsh, one of the blue carbon ecosystems that can adapt and mitigate climate change influence, is drawing global attention due to its high carbon sequestration capability. In China, however, coastal salt marsh has suffered great losses. Nation-wide analysis of salt marsh trends and management is critical to ecosystem protection and restoration. Thus, by analyzing previous coastal salt marsh studies, we found that the extent of coastal salt marsh varied greatly among the Liao River Delta , the Yellow River Delta, the middle coast of Jiangsu Province, Chongming Dongtan and Jiuduansha in Shanghai, with a 59% overall loss of salt marsh extent from the 1980s to the 2010s. The rate of salt marsh loss slowed down after the year 2000. Coastal land-claim (reclamation) is the most dominant driver of salt marsh loss. Climate change and coastal erosion , invasive species , and vegetation dynamics driven by competition and succession have also led to various effects on salt marsh extent and the ecological services they provide. Sea level rise , reclamation pressure and environmental pollution are the main factors, as negative drivers, together with conservation and restoration policies, as positive ones, affecting future trends in salt marshes. China has implemented several measures to protect and restore salt marshes, such as setting up protected areas, drawing marine ecological redline, and making strict regulations on reclamation. However, stronger legal protection for wetlands , more effective enforcement, and participation by local communities can further enhance salt marsh restoration, conservation and management. ]\n","425\n","iteracion 426\n","[ Preliminary observations on bacterial transport in a coastal plain aquifer ]\n","426\n","[ A multidisciplinary research team, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Subsurface Science Program, initiated a field-scale bacterial transport study in a sandy aquifer on the coastal plain of Virginia in 1994. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the relative importance of hydrogeological and geochemical heterogeneity in controlling bacterial transport. Extensive geophysical and geochemical characterization of the site was accomplished using intact cores obtained during the construction of the flow field and in a nearby sand pit exposure of the sedimentary facies found in the flow field. Geophysical techniques, including ground penetrating radar and cross borehole tomography, were used to relate the depositional environment of the sand pit to the flow field as well as to produce a 3-dimensional depiction of the flow field to be used in modeling the site and the results of the injection experiments. The 30 m long flow cell consists of ground water production and injection wells, a tracer injection well, and 10 multilevel samplers screened every half meter from 4.0 to 10.5 m below ground surface. The organization that owns the field site required that only native microorganisms be introduced at the site, therefore, the injected bacterial strain was isolated from the indigenous community in the aquifer. Candidate strains were selected by a protocol that enriched for phenotypes of low adhesion and non-clinical antibiotic resistance which could be used to detect the organism on selective media. The bacteria were selected for low adhesion to site sediments so that they might be readily transported through the aquifer. For the field injection experiment detection and quantitation of the strain chosen by this screening process, PL2W31, was accomplished by isotopically enriching the cells with [ 13 C]glucose. Forced gradient conservative (Br − ) tracer tests were performed immediately prior to the bacterial injection experiment to provide a measure of non-reactive transport through the aquifer. The non-reactive tracer test indicated the presence of hydrogeological heterogeneities at the site that caused differential breakthrough of the tracer. Results from the bacterial transport experiment indicate that bacteria traveled the length of the flow field (4 m), but that the majority of the biomass injected was retained in the sediments between the injection well and the first multilevel sampler at 0.5 m. Preliminary bacterial transport models indicate that the observed behavior could be accounted for by the presence of two subpopulations within a single bacterial strain with differing transport properties. ]\n","426\n","iteracion 427\n","[ Seascape ecology in Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows: Linking structure and ecological processes for management ]\n","427\n","[ Highlights Natural and anthropogenic factors carve Posidonia oceanica seascapes.

Amongst the 60 or so seagrass species, the endemic Mediterranean species Posidonia oceanica forms meadows that are arguably the most important shallow water coastal habitat in the region but which are subjected to high anthropogenic pressures. Because of the relatively large size of the plant, the meadows formed by this seagrass have high architectural and morphological complexity, which results in different morphotypes or seascapes. While numerous studies of P. oceanica architectural characteristics for continuous meadows of the seagrass are available, few works have addressed seascape ecological features and the influence of environmental factors (natural and anthropogenic) thereon. In the present review, we give an overview of P. oceanica meadow architectural and morphological characteristics and how these contribute to Mediterranean landscapes and seascapes. Studies addressing the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors on morphometric features of different meadow types and landscape ecological characteristics of P. oceanica habitat are also reviewed, as well as their influence on ecosystem processes.

Over regions of sharp terrain, both DTC and WTC should be provided at high rate. , Satellite radar altimetry is nowadays a powerful and attractive Earth Observation technique of major importance in several applications such as the study of mean sea level change (a crucial climate change indicator), the observation of continental ice sheets' melting or the management of highly sensitive coastal zones and continental water resources.

A good understanding of PNC is essential to control atmospheric ultrafine particles (UFP) and protect public health. In this study, we reviewed the PNC studies in the literature aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding about the levels, trends, and sources of PNC in China. The PNC levels at the urban, suburban, rural, remote, and coastal sites in China were 8500–52,200, 8600–30,300, 8600–28,400, 2100–16,100, and 5700-19,600 cm −3 , respectively. The wide ranges of PNC indicate significant heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of PNC, but also are partly due to the different measurement techniques deployed in different studies. In general, it still can be concluded that the PNC levels at urban &gt; suburban &gt; rural &gt; coastal &gt; remote sites. Except for Mt. Waliguan (a remote site of 3816 m a.s.l.), other cities had the highest PNC in spring or winter and the lowest in summer or autumn. Long-term changes of PNCs in Beijing and Nanjing indicated that PNCs of Nucleation and Aitken modes had substantially declined following stricter emission controls in recent years, but more frequent new particle formation (NPF) events were observed due to reduction in coagulation sink. Overall, traffic emission was the most dominant source of PNC in more than 94.4% of the selected cities around the world, while combustion2 (the energy production and industry related combustion source), background aerosol, and nucleation sources were also important contributors to PNC. This study provides insights about PNC and its sources around the world, especially in China.

A ‘Clean Ocean’ is one of the ambitious goals of the United Nations (UN) Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development . If this is to be realized, it is imperative to build upon the work of the previous decades (1980–2020). The objectives of the present study were to assess the state of knowledge about: (i) the distribution, quantification, sources, transport and fate of marine debris/litter and microplastics in the coastal/marine environment of the CLME and, (ii) the effects of plastics on biodiversity. Snapshots, i.e., peer-reviewed studies and multi-year (1991–2020) marine debris data from International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) events, indicated that plastic debris was a persistent issue in multiple ecosystems and environmental compartments of the CLME. Collectively, a suite of approaches (debris categorization, remote sensing , particle tracking) indicated that plastic debris originated from a combination of land and marine-based sources, with the former more significant than the latter. Rivers were identified as an important means of transporting mismanaged land-based waste to the marine environment. Oceanic currents were important to the transport of plastic debris into, within and out of the region. Plastic debris posed a threat to the biodiversity of the CLME, with specific biological, physical, ecological and chemical effects being identified. Existing data can be used to inform interventions to mitigate the leakage of plastic waste to the marine environment.

Most classifications of deltas have focused on subaerial plan morphology as a simplistic function of river, tide, and wave energy. New work, however, is revealing the importance of subaqueous deposits, and in particular shore-parallel sediment redistribution, in the shaping of delta planform. Delta asymmetry has emerged as an important characteristic reflective of patterns of alongshore sediment dispersal. Asymmetry has been described from onshore and offshore environments from several different types of modern deltas, but aspects of asymmetry have not been fully documented and the degree to which these patterns are recorded in deltaic strata is not yet known. This study is a comprehensive literature review of sediment distributions in modern deltas focusing on studies with high resolution geomorphic, geophysical, and geochronological datasets. We reviewed 27 deltas using over 100 papers primarily from the past 15–20 years. Morphological, facies, and stratigraphic aspects were analyzed across the entire spectrum of deposits from the delta apex to the most distal muds of the prodelta. We define quantifiable indices of asymmetry describing upcurrent vs. downcurrent distribution of sediment volume, sediment area, sediment caliber, and distributary channels. Most deltas are asymmetrical to some degree with respect to one or more of these parameters. Many deltas are increasingly skewed toward the downcurrent side from proximal to distal sub-environments (i.e. delta plain, delta front, prodelta). Some deltas are skewed toward the upcurrent side in one sub-environment and toward the downcurrent side in another sub-environment. Sand is preferentially deposited on the downcurrent side of most deltas, but distributary channels tend to develop toward the upcurrent side. The highest sand:mud ratios are often on the upcurrent side in the lower delta plain, but in the delta front these ratios are highest on the downcurrent side. These complex patterns of asymmetry reflect different combinations of controls including discharge partitioning, lobe abandonment and localized transgression, plume deflection by coastal currents, dominance of longshore current direction, variable subsidence, and other factors. These processes may result in upcurrent–downcurrent variations in clinoform geometry, rates of progradation, and stratal lapping relationships. Asymmetry has multiple aspects, manifestations, and controls – even within a single delta – but the long-term preservation potential of these patterns likely varies, depending on depositional setting and shoreline trajectory. Studies of ancient deltas will be better-informed by recognizing the wide variety of controls on sediment distribution and avoiding the tendency toward a single model of delta asymmetry. ]\n","432\n","iteracion 433\n","[ Participatory and rapid vulnerability assessments to support adaptation planning in small-scale fishing communities of the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem ]\n","433\n","[ Coastal fishing communities who depend on marine resources for food and livelihood are particularly vulnerable to the risks and impacts associated with climate variability and change.

The detailed study of the sedimentary architecture and stacking pattern permitted separation of the pile into five depositional units bounded by erosional surfaces and characterised by separate facies associations (genetic sequences = units in this paper). At the base of the series, aeolian deposits (Unit 1) mark the development of a possible coastal desert during the late Miocene aridification. The major Pliocene sea-level rise (Transgressive Systems Tract) led to the drowning of the continental platform into a discrete shoreface–foreshore sequence (Unit 2), followed by an expanded deltaic sequence (Unit 3) that represents the main outcrop of the area. The sedimentary fabric of this prograding wedge during the Highstand Systems Tract reveals laterally stacked pluri-hectometic mouth bars built by the abrupt switching of a bird-foot delta during the Pliocene highstand. The clinoforms are deeply incised by submarine gullies filled both by periodic river-driven turbidite and tidal currents (Unit 4) during the coeval growing of the delta. The topset of the prograding wedge and associated gullies infill is truncated by an overall erosional unconformity that marks the widespread development of an extensive braid-delta system (Unit 5) during the lower Pleistocene sea-level drop (Lowstand Systems Tract). The last 6 m of the Braid-delta unit is overprinted by a ferallitic profile, forming the surface of the plateau and indicating long-term subaerial exposure and weathering processes consistent with the maximum warming of the middle to late Pleistocene interglacial periods. The successive abrupt shifts of the depositional systems through the sedimentary pile indicate a high-amplitude sea level amplified by major coastal uplifts and the reorganisation of the fluvial network. In this context, the palaeo-Cuanza prograding wedge signals the westward tilting and 60 m total uplift of the coastal plain during the Pliocene. A new uplift pulse by differential tilt and slope increase is deduced from the widespread development of the braid-delta complex during the early Pleistocene.

The authors suggest that further studies be carried out under anaerobic conditions. , Sensitive biomes, such as coastal ecosystems , have become increasingly susceptible to environmental impacts caused by oil logistics and storing, which, although more efficient nowadays, still cause spills. Thus, bioremediation techniques attract attention owing to their low impact on the environment. Among petroleum-based compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known for their potential impact and persistence in the environment. Therefore, PAH bioremediation is notably a technique capable of reducing these polluting compounds in the environment. However, there is a lack of understanding of microbial growth process conditions, leading to a less efficient choice of bioremediation methods. This article provides a review of the bioremediation processes in mangroves contaminated with oils and PAHs and an overview of some physicochemical and biological factors. Special attention was given to the lack of approach regarding experiments that have been conducted in situ and that considered the predominance of the anaerobic condition of mangroves. ]\n","437\n","iteracion 438\n","[ Storm-induced risk assessment: Evaluation of two tools at the regional and hotspot scale ]\n","438\n","[ Highlights The RISC-KIT project has developed tools to promote risk assessment. The CRAF (Coastal Risk Assessment Framework) is recommended to identify and rank hotspots at the regional scale. The Early Warning System/Decision Support System is used to predict potential impacts and to test the effectiveness of risk reduction. The developed tools can be adopted in a wide range of coastal areas. , Coastal zones are under increasing risk as coastal hazards increase due to climate change and the consequences of these also increase due to on-going economic development. To effectively deal with this increased risk requires the development of validated tools to identify coastal areas of higher risk and to evaluate the effectiveness of disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures. This paper analyses the performance in the application of two tools which have been developed in the RISC-KIT project: the regional Coastal Risk Assessment Framework (CRAF) and a hotspot early warning system coupled with a decision support system (EWS/DSS). The paper discusses the main achievements of the tools as well as improvements needed to support their further use by the coastal community. The CRAF, a tool to identify and rank hotspots of coastal risk at the regional scale, provides useful results for coastal managers and stakeholders. A change over time of the hotspots location and ranking can be analysed as a function of changes on coastal occupation or climate change. This tool is highly dependent on the quality of available information and a major constraint to its application is the relatively poor availability and accessibility of high-quality data, particularly in respect to social-economic indicators, and to lesser extent the physical environment. The EWS/DSS can be used as a warning system to predict potential impacts or to test the effectiveness of risk reduction measures at a given hotspot. This tool provides high resolution results, but needs validation against impact data, which are still scarce. The EWS/DSS tool can be improved by enhancing the vulnerability relationships and detailing the receptors in each area (increasing the detail, but also model simulations). The developed EWS/DSS can be adapted and extended to include a greater range of conditions (including climate change), receptors, hazards and impacts, enhancing disaster preparedness for effective risk reduction for further events or morphological conditions. Despite these concerns, the tools assessed in this paper proved to be valuable instruments for coastal management and risk reduction that can be adopted in a wide range of coastal areas. ]\n","438\n","iteracion 439\n","[ Critical gaps in seagrass protection reveal the need to address multiple pressures and cumulative impacts ]\n","439\n","[ Highlights Protecting seagrass requires legislation and policies to address multiple threats. Climate mitigation strategies specific to seagrass ecosystems are nascent. Management plans can address the impact of the interactions among multiple threats. Lack of temporal monitoring data on seagrass trends. The inclusion of cumulative impacts to management frameworks is a priority. , Management is failing to adequately protect coastal ecosystems . Here we reviewed the policies, legislation, plans and management frameworks intended to protect seagrass meadows in 20 case-studies with the aim of identifying critical gaps in seagrass protection. The case-studies were chosen to represent a range of regions known to have high cumulative impacts or outstanding seagrass management. We asked five ‘key questions’ in our review to identify gaps in seagrass protection: 1) are seagrass habitats identified as an ecosystem of environmental significance, 2) what are their main threats, 3) does management consider cumulative impacts and 4) multiple pressures, and 5) are these habitats recovering? Seagrass protection was enacted inconsistently, through a range of legislative, policy and planning processes that only sought to mitigate some of the known pressures. Although the importance of preserving biodiversity and ecosystem services were acknowledged in over 80% of the case-studies, actionable plans to specifically address known pressures were lacking. Poor integration across jurisdictional realms and sectoral management approaches prevented the holistic strategy needed to address multiple pressures. We suggest a priority for enhancing protection of seagrass ecosystems is improving legislation, policies and planning frameworks to consider multiple pressures and cumulative impacts from marine and land-based activities. Management of seagrass ecosystems is likely to be indicative of trends in coastal management more generally, highlighting the urgent need to address multiple pressures and cumulative impacts in legislation and policies. ]\n","439\n","iteracion 440\n","[ Coupling watershed - coast systems to study evolutionary trends: A review ]\n","440\n","[ This article proposes a review of the researches dealing with the interaction between watersheds and coastal areas.

Challenges, outlook and perspective in transition towards carbon neutrality. , Hybrid renewable integration, electrification, hydrogenation, spatiotemporal energy sharing and migration, and optimisations are necessary roadmaps for the transition towards low-carbon airport transportation systems. In this study, a comprehensive review on sustainable airport energy ecosystems with hydrogen-based renewable-grid-storage-flexibility, has been conducted, from perspectives of airport energy ecosystem constitutions, renewable supported power supply chain, novel spatiotemporal energy migration paradigms, single and multi-objective optimisations, together with multi-criteria decision-making approaches. Hydrogenation in jet aircraft systems has various advantages, such as lightweight with low fuel transportation load, high specific energy, zero CO 2 emissions, and low NOx emissions, reduced air pollution, and environmental sustainability. Depending on different energy sources, liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) can be produced by solar energy, wind energy, coastal ocean energy, and bioenergy , through chemical technologies and water electrolysis from renewable power. Synergistic operation between land and air transportation systems can promote net-zero emissions. Novel energy interaction frameworks have been formulated, for inter-city/inter-country energy sharing and trading, spatiotemporal compensation on uneven distributed renewable energy resources , and high penetration of renewables. Results showed that power characteristics in airport energy systems include lightweight, high-energy density, energy-intensive, fast power response, safety, stochastic, nonlinear, and dynamics. Coastal energy resources are full of huge potentials to support airport energy systems, through off-shore wind turbines , floating PV panels, current turbines, wave energy converters, tidal stream generators , and ocean thermo-electric generators.

Here, a database-driven quantitative statistical analysis of 87 late-Quaternary incised-valley fills (IVFs) has been undertaken to assess the general validity and predictive value of classical facies models for IVFs, and to investigate the relative importance of possible controls on their stratigraphic organization. Based on datasets from the published literature stored in a sedimentological database, the geometry and proportion of systems tracts, and of architectural elements of different hierarchies within IVFs are quantified. These variables were analysed to assess how they vary in relation to parameters that represent potential controlling factors: relative sea-level stage, continental-margin type, drainage-basin area, valley geometry, basin physiography and shoreline hydrodynamics. The stratigraphic organization of the studied coastal-plain IVFs is generally consistent with that represented in facies models, the primary control being the rate and magnitude of relative sea-level change. However, results from this study demonstrate significant variability in the stratigraphic architectures of IVFs, which is not accounted for by existing models. Variations in the facies architecture of coastal-plain and cross-shelf valley fills can be attributed to controls other than sea level, and expressed in relationships with continental-margin type, basin physiography, catchment area , river-system size and shoreline hydrodynamics. The following primary findings arise from this research. (i) Compared to their counterparts on passive margins, coastal-plain IVFs hosted on active margins contain, on average, a higher proportion of fluvial deposits and a lower proportion of central-basin estuarine deposits; estuarine deposits tend however to be thicker. This suggests a control on IVF stratigraphic architecture exerted by distinct characteristics of the tectonic setting of the host continental margins, notably basin physiography, rates and mode of sediment supply, and nature of sediment load. (ii) The thickness and proportion of lowstand systems tract are positively correlated with coastal-plain IVF dimensions, likely reflecting the role of drainage-basin area in dictating the scale of the fluvial systems that carved and infilled the valleys. (iii) Positive correlations are observed between the thickness of fluvial deposits, bayhead-delta deposits and central-basin estuarine deposits, versus coastal-plain IVF dimensions and valley catchment area. This suggests a control exerted by the river-system scale on sediment-supply rates and on the accommodation determined by valley size. (iv) Positive correlations between the thickness and proportion of barrier-complex deposits within cross-shelf IVFs versus mean shelf gradient indicate that the geometry of the shelf might control the establishment and preservation of barrier-island environments in incised valleys located on the shelf. (v) Correlations between the width of coastal-plain IVFs and present-day mean tidal range at the shoreline indicate that tidal dynamics may contribute to the widening of the incised valleys. Positive correlation is observed between the proportion of tide-dominated elements in highstand IVF deposits and IVF width, suggesting possible effects of interplays between hydrodynamic conditions and the geometry of incised valleys on their infills . This study highlights the complexity of the internal fills of incised valleys, which must be considered when attempting the application of facies models of IVFs to rock-record interpretations or as predictive tools in subsurface studies. ]\n","442\n","iteracion 443\n","[ The importance of attention to customary tenure solutions: slow onset risks and the limits of Vanuatu’s climate change and resettlement policy ]\n","443\n","[ Highlights Across Oceania the risk that sea-level rise will lead to forced relocation is high. Pacific leaders repeatedly express the importance of non-economic losses such as their deep ontological connections to their land, and that leaving their islands can only be considered an option of ‘last resort’. Sea-level rise, coastal flooding and surge inundation is an increasingly pressing problem across the urban Pacific, including the urban and coastal population of Vanuatu. Vanuatu has developed a national policy on climate and disaster induced displacement that is overly human rights and state focused but largely ignores customary land tenure arrangements. In the Pacific the overwhelming majority of land is held under customary tenure arrangements and managed by customary institutions. Providing durable solutions to resettlement and disaster-induced displacement requires attention to customary tenure solutions. , The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Oceans and the Cryosphere in a Changing Climate suggests sea level rise may be best understood as a slow onset disaster for Pacific Island countries and, in particular, low lying atoll nations. Sea-level rise, coastal flooding and surge inundation is an increasingly pressing problem across the urban Pacific. This paper begins with a discussion of how issues such as sea level rise and forced relocation are addressed within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations (UNFCCC) and, specifically in the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM). Beyond the material impacts, what is even more important for Pacific people in the context of long-term climate induced displacement are the non-economic losses associated with the loss of human life, cultural connection and loosing connection to their ancestral land and places of belonging. In this context, the Vanuatu government have recently developed a climate change and resettlement policy which supposedly offers three broad state-oriented and human rights-based durable solutions to resettlement. However in Vanuatu, like elsewhere in the Pacific, the overwhelming majority of land is held under customary tenure arrangements. An alternative, and arguably more effective approach, to resettlement solutions may be to negotiate arrangements through customary institutions rather than the state. ]\n","443\n","iteracion 444\n","[ Seasonal and inter-annual ONSET Sea Surface Temperature variability along the northern coast of the Gulf of Guinea ]\n","444\n","[ The aim of this study is to characterize the coastal upwelling variability at seasonal and inter-annual time scales in the northern Gulf of Guinea (NGoG) using Sea Surface Temperature (SST) collected with autonomous “ONSET” thermometers . Results show that the ONSET SST data are suitable for numerical model evaluation, and provide relevant information in addition to satellite and reanalysis data at seasonal cycle. The minor and major coastal upwellings are present in all the products. The inter-annual SST variability is more pronounced in the western part of the region (Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana) than in the eastern part (Benin and Nigeria). The pattern differences between the west and the east of the region highlight a large spatial variability of the SST in the NGoG. Indeed, the signal of the minor upwelling season is visible only in the west of the basin, namely between Cape Palmas and Cape Three Points. We also observe a well-established thermal gradient between the western and eastern parts of the basin. This gradient is increasing from west to east during the major upwelling season, and decreasing from east to west during the rest of the year. The coastal ONSET data allow to evidence higher SST anomalies than those deduced from satellite and reanalysis products. Although the cold or warm events observed in 2008, 2010 and 2012 are well detected by all products, only the ONSET data set reveal the strong negative SST anomaly observed in 2009 along the coast of Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. ]\n","444\n","iteracion 445\n","[ Nebkhas: An essay in aeolian biogeomorphology ]\n","445\n","[ Nebkhas are a type of anchored dune that forms by sediment accumulation around grasses, shrubs or trees.

Nebkhas are very widespread in dry and coastal environments. They have considerable importance because they can be ‘islands of fertility’ and have major hydrological and biological effects. They can, if eroded, be major sources of dust emission. Examples of coastal nebkhas are known from both temperate areas and from lower latitude drylands, as along the Caspian shoreline in Iran, Kuwait, northern Peru, Namibia, Western Sahara, the Makran, southwest Madagascar, and Mauritania. Dryland nebkhas have been described from numerous areas, with concentrations of studies in Kuwait, the southwest USA, northwest China, and Iran. Within an area with suitable climatic conditions, nebkhas do not occur everywhere. Certain conditions need to be met for their development and these are illustrated with examples from the Tarim and Qaidam basins of China, the Lut of Iran, northwest Argentina, and the Namib. For this, Google Earth was employed. The heights of these features range from a matter of centimeters to as much as 20 m. There is a considerable quantity of data on the plants that are associated with the development of nebkhas. They have to have certain qualities for this role: ability to withstand drought, tolerate salt, thrive on sand burial, have wide shallow rooting systems to obtain water from fog and occasional rain events, extract moisture from groundwater, withstand sand abrasion, and develop adventitious roots . Although nebkhas are normally thought of as a type of sand dune, and most nebkhas are indeed composed of sand-sized material, largely consisting of quartz, there are many nebkhas which contain appreciable amounts of silt and clay, as well as salts such as gypsum . Although some nebkhas are ephemeral features, various dating techniques have shown that they can be decades, centuries and even millennia old. ]\n","445\n","iteracion 446\n","[ Invasive Spartina alterniflora in controlled cultivation: Environmental implications of converging future technologies ]\n","446\n","[ Highlights Not all invasive plants are unusable, Spartina alterniflora (SA) has multiple exploitable benefits.

SA is an underrated plant species with multiple application potential. , Invasive species have become a major threat to ecosystem stability, diversity and sustainability in recent times. Invasive plants such as Spartina alterniflora (SA), outgrow resident flora by rapidly utilizing essential soil nutrients depriving the native plant species, impacting the ecosystem diversity and stability. SA is also notorious for its effect on local biodiversity as it grows and spreads faster, ultimately dominating local biodiversity. This dominance and the negative effect of invasive SA is due to features such as allochemical’s secretion, positive feedback between plant and soil, and rapid absorption of soil nutrients, exerting a competitive advantage over native plants. Therefore, in this review, we aim to contemplate the implications and potential applications of SA under control conditions or special circumstances as a source of biomass, soil restorer, CO 2 capture agent, soil resilience enhancer and pollution remover as most of the studies on SA have focused on controlling its impact on the local ecosystem. On the other hand, SA's ability to grow quickly in poor alkaline soils is useful but very little is explored to exploit SA for biomass production in controlled cultivation in different environmental conditions. In addition to these aspects, the CO 2 sequestration capability requires greater focus, especially in sensitive salt marshes and wetlands along the coastal areas. ]\n","446\n","iteracion 447\n","[ The application of the DAPSI(W)R(M) framework to the plastic pellets chain ]\n","447\n","[ Highlights Responses can act in different stages through the plastic pellets chain.

Here we present a systematic review on the use of metabarcoding for NIS surveillance in marine and coastal ecosystems, through the analysis of 42 publications. Metabarcoding has been mainly applied to environmental DNA (eDNA) from water samples, but also to DNA extracted from bulk organismal samples. DNA extraction kits have been widely used and the 18S rRNA and the COI genes the most employed markers, but less than half of the studies targeted more than one marker loci. The Illumina MiSeq platform has been used in &gt;50% of the publications. Current weaknesses include potential occurrence of false negatives due to the primer-biased or faulty DNA amplification and the incompleteness of reference libraries. This is particularly concerning in the case of NIS surveillance, where proficiency in species level detection is critical. Until these weaknesses are resolved, ideally NIS metabarcoding should be supported by complementary approaches, such as morphological analysis or more targeted molecular approaches (e.g. qPCR, ddPCR). Even so, metabarcoding has already proved to be a highly sensitive tool to detect small organisms or undifferentiated life stages across a wide taxonomic range. In addition, it also seems to be very effective in ballast water management and to improve the spatial and temporal sampling frequency of NIS surveillance in marine and coastal ecosystems. Although specific protocols may be required for species-specific NIS detection, for general monitoring it would be vital to settle on a standard protocol able to generate comparable results among surveillance campaigns and regions of the globe, seeking the best approach for detecting the broadest range of species, while minimizing the chances of a false positive or negative detection. ]\n","449\n","iteracion 450\n","[ Implications of COVID-19 on global environmental pollution and carbon emissions with strategies for sustainability in the COVID-19 era ]\n","450\n","[ Highlights COVID-19 improved PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , and CO levels but not SO 2 and O 3 levels.

Freshwater Ni bioavailability follows spatial trends in dissolved organic carbon. A critical gap to Ni risk assessment is a lack of toxicity data with Arctic species. Climate change will affect Ni exposure and may influence its effects in the Arctic. , The Arctic faces many environmental challenges, including the continued exploitation of its mineral resources such as nickel (Ni). The responsible development of Ni mining in the Arctic requires establishing a risk assessment framework that accounts for the specificities of this unique region. We set out to conduct preliminary assessments of Ni exposure and effects in aquatic Arctic ecosystems . Our analysis of Ni source and transport processes in the Arctic suggests that fresh, estuarine, coastal, and marine waters are potential Ni-receiving environments, with both pelagic and benthic communities being at risk of exposure. Environmental concentrations of Ni show that sites with elevated Ni concentrations are located near Ni mining operations in freshwater environments , but there is a lack of data for coastal and estuarine environments near such operations. Nickel bioavailability in Arctic freshwaters seems to be mainly driven by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with bioavailability being the highest in the High Arctic, where DOC levels are the lowest. However, this assessment is based on bioavailability models developed from non-Arctic species. At present, the lack of chronic Ni toxicity data on Arctic species constitutes the greatest hurdle toward the development of Ni quality standards in this region. Although there are some indications that polar organisms may not be more sensitive to contaminants than non-Arctic species, biological adaptations necessary for life in polar environments may have led to differences in species sensitivities, and this must be addressed in risk assessment frameworks. Finally, Ni polar risk assessment is further complicated by climate change, which affects the Arctic at a faster rate than the rest of the world. Herein we discuss the source, fate, and toxicity of Ni in Arctic aquatic environments , and discuss how climate change effects (e.g., permafrost thawing, increased precipitation, and warming) will influence risk assessments of Ni in the Arctic. ]\n","451\n","iteracion 452\n","[ Effects of microplastics on bivalves: Are experimental settings reflecting conditions in the field? ]\n","452\n","[ Highlights Microplastic (MP) exposure studies on bivalves must reflect realistic exposure risks The focus of experiments on mussels and nanoplastics is environmentally relevant.

Overall, the low concentrations of dissolved vitamin B 12 B 12 and the significant and positive relationship between depth-weighted water column averages of Chl- a and vitamin B 12 B 12 (r 2 = 0 . 80 2 = 0 . 80 , p&gt;0.001), suggest that this micronutrient might play a significant role in phytoplankton biomass production during the spring productive period of this coastal ecosystem . The temporal cycle elucidated from this data described an exhaustion of vitamin B 12 B 12 winter inventory by direct consumption during the phytoplankton productive period and a stock recovery in August. ]\n","454\n","iteracion 455\n","[ Chapter Ten Shore Processes and Human Intervention: A Palaeoenvironmental Perspective ]\n","455\n","[ Publisher This chapter focuses on the role of human interventions in palaeoshoreline changes. Although the present status of shorelines is strongly influenced by the direct and indirect impacts of human activities, especially over the past century, the palaeoenvironmental dimension of shorelines shows the primacy of “naturally” forced processes in shoreline development. There are several examples of naturally changing sedimentary and sea-level conditions that have determined patterns of human settlement and development. Changes in sedimentation induced by tectonics have sometimes led to the demise of such settlements, as in the case of the ancient port fortress of Pelusium on the Nile delta coast of Egypt. Indirect human influence on coastal sediment occurs through changes in forest cover and land use. Documented examples of direct human engineering on shore processes that have left a palaeoenvironmental imprint are few. These examples show, however, how human intervention has influenced past shoreline development, notably in ancient port settings in the Mediterranean. More recent examples involve empoldering of coastal wetlands in Europe during the Middle Ages. ]\n","455\n","iteracion 456\n","[ Post-depositional alteration of onshore tsunami deposits – Implications for the reconstruction of past events ]\n","456\n","[ Sediments provide information on parameters governing their deposition. However, this information gets blurred by post-depositional processes. Here, we document post-depositional alteration processes that affected an onshore tsunami deposit from its deposition in February 2010 until 2014. Post-depositional changes proceeded in three stages. First, the thickness was reduced by 20% within the first months because of erosion by runoff. Second, vegetation returned and bioturbation destroyed the sedimentary structures and obliterated the basal contact. The thickness was reduced further to 20–40% of its initial thickness. The mean grain size decreased as silt and mud from the enclosing soil horizons were mixed into the deposit. Finally, as post-seismic subsidence together with damming by a coastal dune transformed the coastal plain into a wetland, aqueous microbial magnetite reduction set in and dissolved up to 57% of the magnetite . Inverse models are used to reconstruct onshore tsunami flow parameters in order to quantify the intensity of ancient events. Thickness, grain size and bulk density are input parameters to any model. Thus, post-depositional processes affect the reliability of the modeled flow parameters. Of the three documented processes, the post-depositional alteration of the grain size has the highest influence, followed by the reduction of the thickness. The change of the bulk density hardly had any effect. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the calculated flow velocity decreased by 60% from 4.2 m/s for the pristine sediments to 2.5 m/s for the altered deposits. Consequently, inverse models will significantly underestimate tsunami intensity because of the alteration of the deposits. ]\n","456\n","iteracion 457\n","[ Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in mangrove ecosystems: A review ]\n","457\n","[ Highlights PAHs in mangrove ecosystems potentially represent a threat to human health. Urbanization of coastal areas enhances PAHs inputs into mangrove ecosystems. PAHs dynamics in mangrove sediments depend on multiple abiotic factors.

Microbial degradation is the main process of PAHs degradation in mangrove sediments. , Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic pollutants of increasing concern in the different fields of the environment and human health. There are 16 of them that are recognized as priority pollutants by the US environmental protection agency due to their mutagenic and carcinogenic potentials. Due to their hydrophobicity and stability, they are persistent in the environment and can be transported over long distances. Their toxicological effects on multiple species, including humans, as well as their bioaccumulation in the food web became major topics in organic pollutants research this last decade. In the environment, multiple studies have been conducted on their accumulation in the soil and their degradation processes resulting in numerous review papers. However, the dynamics of PAHs in mangrove ecosystems is not yet completely understood. In this review paper, an exhaustive presentation of what is known about PAHs and their transfer, accumulation, and degradation in mangrove ecosystems is offered. This article brings to light the knowledge already acquired on the subject and the perspective research necessary to fully comprehend PAHs dynamics in mangrove ecosystems. ]\n","457\n","iteracion 458\n","[ Elucidating the vertical transport of microplastics in the water column: A review of sampling methodologies and distributions ]\n","458\n","[ Highlights Sampling methods of MPs in the water column were reviewed and evaluated. Vertical patterns of MPs were summarized in freshwater system, coastal waters and pelagic zone . Harmonized sampling methods were urgently needed and transport mechanisms were discussed. , There have been numerous studies that have investigated floating microplastics (MPs) in surface water, yet little data are currently available regarding the vertical distribution in the water column. This lack constrains our ability to comprehensively assess the ecological effects of MPs and develop further policy controls. In this study, we reviewed current progress of sampling methodologies, the distribution patterns, and the physiochemical properties of MPs throughout the water column. Three sampling protocols were identified in this study: bulk, net and submersible pump/in-situ sampling. In different regions, the vertical patterns of MPs in the water column varied with depth, which is possibly related to the morphological characteristics, polymeric densities, and biofouling of the MPs. The results of this review revealed that fibrous and fragmented MPs comprised over 90% of the total MPs by quantity, of which fibrous MPs constituted the majority (43%–100%). In addition, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, and polypropylene have been widely identified in previous studies. To minimize the impact caused by various sampling protocols, the use of a volume gradient trail experiment and a unified mesh size of 60–100 μm for the initial concentration are recommended according to the results of this review. Given the limited knowledge regarding the vertical transport of MPs in the water column, harmonized sampling methods should first be developed. The mechanisms of this process can be separately considered for different water bodies, such as freshwater systems, coastal waters, and pelagic zones. The presence of these anthropogenic pollutants in the water column poses a threat to the largest but most vulnerable habitats of life on earth, and hence they merit further investigation. ]\n","458\n","iteracion 459\n","[ Learning from small islands in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO): A systematic review of responses to environmental change ]\n","459\n","[ Highlights Tropical small islands are in the frontline of rapid environmental change. Diverse responses are planned and/or implemented in the Western Indian Ocean small islands. Most responses are governmental, linked to policies and regulatory measures. Increasing interest in ecological restoration and community-based responses. Response effectiveness depends on context, funding, time, knowledge and governance. , Tropical small islands are particularly vulnerable to environmental impacts. In the small islands of the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), multiple stressors of environmental and socio-economic change interact and intensify at reduced spatial scales . Actors and institutions need to respond to these changes through responses – reactive or proactive actions planned or implemented by individuals, groups or organisations; aimed at responding to changing contexts and scenarios, by reducing, preventing and/or reverting the risks and impacts of environmental change. Through a mixed-method systematic review of academic literature from 2010 to 2020 using the Web of Science literature database, we document the types of responses, actors involved and elements of effective responses. We analysed 329 studies focusing on nine WIO small island states and territories (SISTs) – Zanzibar, Mafia, Seychelles, Comoros, Mayotte, La Réunion, Mauritius, Maldives and Lakshadweep. Using quantitative content analysis, we organised information into categories ranging from institutional (economic instruments, laws, policies and community based), social (educational and informational), infrastructural (engineered and technological) and ecological restoration-based responses. The articles varied in their geographical distribution , focus and depth with regard to the responses studied. Diverse responses are documented, that often overlap across categories and may be combined and pursued simultaneously. For example, responses range from coastal protection structures, land reclamation , land elevation and artificial islands to mangrove restoration, awareness raising programs, coastal zone regulations and climate induced migration and relocation policies. Responses were predominantly institutional (85% of 329 articles, n = 281) – mainly driven by governments. The most common social responses (53%, n = 183) were linked to environmental education programs and knowledge sharing platforms. Although the responses indicated an increasing interest in ecological restoration (27%, n = 91) and community-based initiatives (36%, n = 120), they were largely underrepresented in research. Cataloguing the different responses may help incorporate the diversity into well-informed decisions, offer alternative ways of thinking and highlight specific areas and response types that should be the focus of future research and practice. The elements influencing the effectiveness of responses were identified through thematic synthesis – relevance to the local social-ecological context, resources available (time and funding), knowledge (access, diversity, integration, transfer, innovative and anticipatory), governance of responses (coordinated, transparent, adaptive, equitable, participatory and polycentric) and iterative monitoring. These elements of effectiveness tend to be synergistic and no single element is effective in isolation. When these elements are not considered, the response intervention could be maladaptive or counterproductive. Poorly designed responses result in perverse social and ecological outcomes, further increasing the exposure and vulnerability to the environmental stressors and decreasing public confidence and support. This review documents current literature, points to knowledge gaps and highlights the potential for islands to learn from each other and to further apply these lessons to non-island settings, critically considering the local context. ]\n","459\n","iteracion 460\n","[ A birds-eye view of biological connectivity in mangrove systems ]\n","460\n","[ Considerable advances in understanding of biological connectivity have flowed from studies of fish-facilitated connectivity within the coastal ecosystem mosaic. However, there are limits to the information that fish can provide on connectivity. Mangrove-bird communities have the potential to connect coastal habitats in different ways and at different scales than fish, so incorporation of these links into our models of coastal ecosystem mosaics affords the opportunity to greatly increase the breadth of our understanding. We review the habitat and foraging requirements of mangrove-bird functional groups to understand how bird use of mangroves facilitates biological connectivity in coastal ecosystem mosaics, and how that connectivity adds to the diversity and complexity of ecological processes in mangrove ecosystems. Avian biological connectivity is primarily characterized by foraging behavior and habitat/resource requirements. Therefore, the consequence of bird links for coastal ecosystem functioning largely depends on patterns of habitat use and foraging, and potentially influences nutrient cycling, top–down control and genetic information linkage. Habitats that experience concentrated bird guano deposition have high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, placing particular importance on the consequences of avian nutrient translocation and subsidization for coastal ecosystem functioning. High mobility allows mangrove-bird communities to link mangrove forests to other mangrove, terrestrial and marine-pelagic systems. Therefore, the spatial scale of coastal connectivity facilitated by birds is substantially more extensive than fish-facilitated connectivity. In particular, migratory birds link habitats at regional, continental and inter-continental scales as they travel among seasonally available feeding areas from breeding grounds to non-breeding grounds; scales at which there are few fish equivalents. Knowledge of the nature and patterns of fish connectivity have contributed to shifting the initial, historical perception of mangrove-ecosystem functioning from that of a simple system based on nutrient and energy retention, to a view that includes fish-facilitated energy export. In a similar way, understanding the nature and implications of mangrove connectivity through bird movements and migrations affords new possibilities for revising our view of the extent of functional links between mangroves and other ecosystems. ]\n","460\n","iteracion 461\n","[ Linking prawn and shrimp farming towards a green economy in Bangladesh: Confronting climate change ]\n","461\n","[ The coastal aquaculture sector in Bangladesh is dominated by export-oriented freshwater prawn and brackishwater shrimp farming, both are commercially known as “white gold” because of transnational value.

Specific behavior of rare-earth elements in technogenesis soils were revealed. , In anthropogenic soils of Sochi (the Black Sea coast, humid subtropical zone of Russia), the acid-alkali properties are transformed in comparison with natural soils (Haplic Acrisols (Clayic)). The pH-water index shifted from 5.8 to 7.5 (average values for the genetic horizons of soils), alkali saturation increased 1.3 times in the upper horizon (from 72.9 to 97.7%) and 1.5 times (from 64.8 to 97.3 %) in the middle clay argic horizon.

Net pen aquaculture often overlaps with lobster habitat and fisheries. Some finfish aquaculture stressors impact juveniles more than adult lobsters. Local oceanography, farm production, chemical use, and proximity to key habitat define impacts. Existing assessment tools and ecosystem-based management could help avoid negative interactions. , Globally, lobsters are one of the most economically valuable wild species caught in capture fisheries. Catches are dominated by American lobster ( Homarus americanus) landed entirely in Atlantic Canada and northeastern United States. In Atlantic Canada, lobster fishing and marine finfish aquaculture take place in the same coastal waters creating the potential for negative environmental, as well as social, interactions. We review the state of knowledge of environmental interactions between American lobster, their habitat and fishery, and marine finfish aquaculture. We first provide a brief overview of key biological, behavioural, and ecological processes and environmental stressors of American lobster at different life-history stages followed by an overview of the pathways of effects of marine finfish aquaculture on coastal ecosystems in general and on American lobster. Our review found that certain finfish aquaculture-lobster interactions have received considerable study (e.g., chemical use), whereas knowledge of other interactions are either limited (e.g., net pens, waste discharges) or lacking (e.g., disease, noise, lights, and odours). An ecosystem-based approach to aquaculture has been proposed for managing these interactions but implementing this approach has proven to be a challenge in part because of complex multi-sector, multi-stakeholder and multi-agency governance issues. While governance solutions await development, practical measures based on the results of scientific research identified in this review, such as better use of existing oceanographic and bathymetric data, habitat and human impact assessment tools, and toxicity information offer regulators ample information and management tools, at least at the farm- and bay-scale, to avoid negative finfish aquaculture-lobster interactions in Atlantic Canada.

Understanding the impact of these processes on shoreline–shelf morphodynamics and stratigraphic preservation remains challenging. Numerical modelling integrated with traditional facies analysis provides an increasingly viable approach, with the potential to quantify, and thereby improve understanding of, the impact of these complex coastal sedimentary processes. An integrated approach is presented here that focuses on palaeotidal modelling to investigate the controls on ancient tides and their influence on sedimentary deposition and preservation – one of the three cornerstones of the ternary process classification scheme of shoreline-shelf systems. Numerical tidal modelling methodology is reviewed and illustrated in three palaeotidal model case studies of different scales and focus. The results are synthesised in the context of shoreline–shelf processes, including a critique and modification of the process-based classification scheme. The emphasis on tidal processes reflects their global importance throughout Earth’s history. Ancient palaeotidal models are able to highlight and quantify the following four controls on tidal processes: (1) the physiography (shape and depth) of oceans (1000s km scale) determines the degree of tidal resonance; (2) the physiography of ocean connections to partly enclosed water bodies (100–1000s km scale) determines the regional-scale flux of tidal energy (inflow versus outflow); (3) the physiography of continental shelves influences shelf tidal resonance potential; and (4) tides in relatively local-scale embayments (typically 1–10s km scale) are influenced by the balance of tidal amplification due to funnelling, shoaling and resonance effects versus frictional damping. In deep time, palaeogeographic and palaeobathymetric uncertainty can be accounted for in palaeotidal models by performing sensitivity analyses to different scenarios, across this range of spatial scales. These tidal process controls are incorporated into an updated predictive decision tree for determining shoreline–shelf process regime in terms of the relative interaction of wave, fluvial and tidal processes. The predictive decision tree considers the effects of basin physiography, shelf width and shoreline morphology on wave, fluvial and tidal processes separately. Uncertainty and ambiguity in applying the widely used three-tier process classification scheme are reduced by using the decision tree in conjunction with a proposed two-tier classification of process regime that is limited to primary and secondary processes. This two-tier classification scheme is illustrated in the three case studies, showing how integration of numerical modelling with facies analysis of the preserved stratigraphic record improves confidence in prediction of tide-influenced shoreline-shelf process regimes. Wider application of this approach will further improve process-based classifications and predictions of modern and ancient shoreline–shelf systems. ]\n","466\n","iteracion 467\n","[ Clonal traits and plant invasiveness: The case of Carpobrotus N.E.Br.

More acute LNAPL contaminations with a shorter lifetime are expected. , The intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) predicts significant changes in precipitation patterns, an increase in temperature, and groundwater level variations by 2100. These changes are expected to alter light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) impacts since groundwater level fluctuations and temperature are known to influence both the mobility and release of LNAPL compounds to air and groundwater. Knowledge of these potential effects is currently dispersed in the literature, hindering a clear vision of the processes at play. This review aims to synthesize and discuss the possible effects of the increase in temperature and groundwater level fluctuations on the behavior of LNAPL and its components in a climate change context. In summary, a higher amplitude of groundwater table variations and higher temperatures will probably increase biodegradation processes, the LNAPL mobility, and spreading across the smear zone, favoring the release of LNAPL compounds to the atmosphere and groundwater but decreasing the LNAPL mass and its longevity. Outcomes will, nevertheless, vary greatly across arid, cold, or humid coastal environments, where different effects of climate change are expected.

Any negative impacts of climate change (CC) on inlet environment are therefore very likely to result in significant socio-economic impacts. CC driven variations in mean water level (i.e. SLR), wave conditions and riverflow are likely to affect the stability of, particularly, the thousands of Small Tidal Inlets (STIs, or bar-built/barrier estuary systems) around the world. The combination of their predominant occurrence in developing countries, socio-economic relevance and low community resilience, general lack of data, and high sensitivity to seasonal forcing makes STIs potentially very vulnerable to CC impacts . This article summarises potential CC impacts on the stability of STIs and discusses means by which these CC impacts maybe quantified using existing modelling tools. As presently available process based models cannot be confidently applied with concurrent time varying water level, wave and riverflow forcing over typical CC impact assessment time scales (~ 100 years), a ‘snap-shot’ simulation (~ 1 year duration) approach using process based coastal area morphodyamic models is proposed for qualitative assessments of CC impacts on STIs. As the modelling approach will by necessity depend on the level of data availability, two different ‘snap-shot’ modelling frameworks for ‘data rich’ and ‘data poor’ environments are presented. Process based multi-scale coastal area morphodynamic models and scale aggregated (or reduced complexity) morphodynamic models are identified as modelling approaches that may be pursued in the future to obtain more reliable assessments of CC impacts on STI stability. ]\n","471\n","iteracion 472\n","[ A tentative sediment budget for the Red River subaqueous delta in the Gulf of Tonkin: A synthesis of existing data ]\n","472\n","[ Highlights The Red River is the major source of sediment to the subaqueous delta.

The Red River is the largest sediment source in the subaqueous delta, and its input amounts to 63.957 ± 6.935 Mt/yr (Mt = = 10 6 tonnes) with about 91.39% contribution of the total sediment inputs. Contributions from the atmosphere (0.004 ± 0.001 Mt/yr), the coastal erosion (1.124 ± 0.112 Mt/yr), the anthropogenic input (4.550 ± 0.339 Mt/yr), the primary production (0.114 ± 0.039 Mt/yr) and the seabed erosion (0.232 ± 0.044 Mt/yr) account for only 8.61% of the total input. About 47.72% of total sediment inputs has been deposited in the subaqueous delta. The remaining 52.28%, primarily from the dissolved load (54%) of the Red River, is believed to have been transported southward by the dominant southward flow along the coastline. These results confirm earlier evidence indicating that most of particulate matter from the Red River is deposited close to the river mouth. Comparing accumulation rates over different timescales suggests that the inverse relationship between long- and short-term accumulation rates is the result of the changing balance of sedimentation and erosion processes. Under present conditions we believe that the surficial sediment coarsening in the northern part of the delta front is the result of a combination of the decreasing sediment load of the Red River basin and the dominant southward flow along the coastline This makes contribution to the subaqueous delta change from sedimentation to erosion status.

The results show the occurrence of three well-distinguished palynological zones: (i) from 6200 to 5200 cal yr BP, characterised by mixed rainforest and other taxa related to salinity (coastal-like), low (negative) values of magnetic susceptibility and magnetic grain size, absence of transported clays, and the highest macrocharcoal particles abundance; (ii) from 5200 to 2950 cal yr BP, marked by a replacement of the mangrove-like vegetation by a more inland mixed-swamp forest community with low levels of charcoal, and (iii) from 2950 cal yr BP to present-day, characterised by the establishment of the current vegetation community, dominated by M. flexuosa , and an increasing trend in the charcoal curve since the last 700 years. A combination of regional (climatic changes) and local (sediment ontogeny) has been proposed as the key drivers influencing the vegetation succession recorded. The stabilisation of the sea-level that occurred during the mid-Holocene would have favoured the transgression of the coastal line, with the migration of the coastal-like vegetation seawards. Synchronous to this event, a trend towards drier conditions has been reported in the close Cariaco record, that could have also influenced the vegetation replacement. Between 3800 and 2800 years ago, the increased ENSO variability registered in Cariaco may have played a key role in the expansion of the Mauritia palm community. It is suggested that in our location, the potential inhabiting human populations were differently influenced by these environmental changes. First, the disappearance of the coastal resources could have favoured land abandonment, whereas the increase in the abundance of the palm might be influential for the arrival of other inland cultures that were previously used to manage Mauritia . This sequence shows the importance of the ecosystem services for the location inhabitants, highlighting the abandonment of the mid-Holocene culture coeval with the disappearance of its ecosystem. These results also provide information about the sensitivity and resilience in facing external stressors of both humans and vegetation, and will be valuable tools for managing the future of this ecosystem. ]\n","473\n","iteracion 474\n","[ Recent nationwide climate change impact assessments of natural hazards in Japan and East Asia ]\n","474\n","[ Climate change due to global warming is expected to have major impacts on phenomena such as tropical cyclones (TCs), Baiu, precipitation, and seasonal storms. Many natural disasters in East Asia are driven by TC (typhoon) activity in particular and their associated hazards are sensitive to local-scale characteristics. As such, it is critically important to numerically simulate TC activity (and other phenomenon) on local scales in order to properly assess climate change impacts on natural hazards in the region. In addition, projecting future changes of many TC-related hazards and/or their potential economic impacts can be challenging due to their low occurrence frequencies in any one particular area.

Since then, reforestation, river bed quarrying, land reclamations, dams constructions triggered severe erosion. Hard structures were soon built, somewhere transforming a sandy coast in a rocky one, with impact on tourism activity. Beach fill grew in the late XX cent., but some negative results and sand shortage are pushing for old strategies. As long as shore protection structures grow, beach erosion expands. , Beach erosion started to severely affect the Italian coast in the mid XIX century, mostly at river mouths where settlements were almost absent. When the problem reached developed areas a National law was enacted (1907) favoring defense of coastal settlements, which was mostly addressed through seawalls and revetments . In this way many coastal towns lost their beaches, which today could have a tourist and social function. In the following years, when the beach became an economic resource, groins and detached breakwaters were implemented, frequently triggering down drift erosion, therefore justifying more coastal rock structures. In some localities more than 200 groins or detached breakwaters (or both) are present in a few kilometers of coast. Coastal resilience, previously reduced by longshore urbanization, was definitely zeroed. Beach nourishment started to be carried out consistently in the ‘70s with quarried materials or sediment dredged in harbors or river mouths (for a total of approximately 10 M m 3 ). In the ‘90s marine aggregates commenced to be used in protected and in a few unprotected beach nourishment projects. Approximately 21 M m 3 have been emplaced since then. Difficulties in finding quarried material due to restrictions in opening new quarries for environmental reasons, as well as finding suitable continental shelf sediments, together with the economic crisis, caused a reduction of beach nourishment schemes in recent years. Unsatisfactory results of some projects, where sand was quickly lost or the project did not have the stakeholders' acceptance, are additional reasons for the reduction in beach nourishment projects. Designers are now much more confident with hard defenses, possibly with submerged breakwaters or groins, although many projects retrace the path of the '60s, proving that not all has been learned from past mistakes. This paper could serve as a warning for countries currently entering the process of coastal development. ]\n","476\n","iteracion 477\n","[ Marine debris on the Brazilian coast: which advances in the last decade?

Soviet studies in the 1960–1970's showed that a well-defined sill north of the Bosphorus does not prevent the overflow of dense Mediterranean water onto the shelf even during unfavorable conditions (high surface elevation in the Black Sea and strong northerly winds). The stream makes a sharp westward turn after exiting from the strait and then starts its track downward to the shelf slope. Intensive dispersion of the Mediterranean water occurs at a distance of 25–50 km from the strait. Recent laboratory and mathematical models have been reviewed to describe the behavior of the density and current interfaces in the strait and the role of temporary blockage of the dense flow upon the Mediterranean effluent. Two hypothetic physical mechanisms for sill overflow are discussed. One is associated with bifurcation of the coastal flows, approaching the strait orifice, and formation of a diversion zone in the upper layer which facilitates the flow over the sill. Another hypothesis suggests that the sill exercises frictionless rotational hydraulic control in the short, 4 km continuation of the strait channel. Persistent northeasterly or southerly winds can substantially affect the intensity of the Mediterranean effluent by modifying the average flow fields and density structures in the strait. TS -analysis of far-field property distribution shows that the Mediterranean water contributes to the laminated structure of the Black Sea water column. Under average conditions, the Mediterranean waters follow the mainstream of the Black Sea current system along the Turkish coast, reaching the deepest strata in the southeastern corner of the sea. Ongoing Soviet diversions of fresh water from the northern slope of the Black Sea and projected damming of the major estuaries and the Azov Sea will intensify the Mediterranean effluent and, at the same time, will increase the vertical mixing due to more effective convective overturn. These phenomena will lead to partial or complete disappearance of the H 2 S layer and general warming of the water column. ]\n","479\n","iteracion 480\n","[ South region of the Gulf of California large marine ecosystem upwelling, fluxes of CO 2 and nutrients ]\n","480\n","[ The Gulf of California Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) is one of the most productive and biologically rich marine ecosystems in the world with a high rate of endemic species . The combination of high biological productivity and biological richness characterizing the region is the result of its unique geology and geography, shaping strong currents and tides that generate the upwelling of cool, nutrient-rich waters. These waters support an extremely high abundance of plankton that in turn is the basis of a complex food web sustaining a diversity of fish, birds, and marine mammals . As Mexico's most important fishery region, the Gulf of California provides seafood to locals and for export to other countries. In addition, manifold coastal lagoons , coastal marine sea-beds, mangrove forests, and 922 islands are important reproductive, nesting and nursing sites for hundreds of resident and migratory bird species . However, even when several oceanographic processes that confer a high productivity to the Gulf of California LME have been documented, there is very little field work to monitor these phenomena, such as coastal upwelling in the southern region, as well as the spatial and temporal variability in nutrient concentrations, the effect of exchange with coastal systems and the role of the Gulf of California as a sink or exporter of carbon dioxide (CO₂), for example, in winter the region of the Grandes Islas , there are a source of CO 2 to the atmosphere (pCO 2 &gt;580 µatm).

The western coast was eroded and the eastern part was accreted during 1974 to 2018. Channel and coastal geomorphology have undergone evident adjustments. Human activities have had substantial adverse impacts on the geomorphology. The delta is in sedimentary equilibrium state that may be disturbed in near future. , Intensive studies have been conducted globally in the past decades to understand the evolution of several large deltas. However, despite being one of the largest tropical deltas, the Irrawaddy (Ayeyarwady) Delta has received relatively little attention from the research community. To reduce this knowledge gap, this study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the delta's evolution and identify its influencing factors using remote sensing images from 1974 to 2018, published literature and available datasets on the river, and human impacts in its drainage basin. Our results show that 1) Based on the topographic and geomorphological features , the funnel-shaped Irrawaddy Delta can be divided into two parts: the upper fluvial plain and the lower low-lying coastal plain; 2) The past 44-year shoreline changes show that overall accretion of the delta shoreline was at a rate of 10.4 m/year, and approximately 42% of the shoreline was subjected to erosion from 1974 to 2018. In the western coast, 60% of shoreline was under erosion with an average shoreline change rate of 0.1 m/year. In the east part, 81% of the shoreline was accreted with an average accretion rate of 24 m/year; 3) River channel geomorphological analysis indicates that three distributaries of the Irrawaddy, Bogale, and Toe have developed most active sandbars, which coincides with the amount of water they discharged (&gt;50%). This implies that these three distributaries might be the currently most active channels in the delta; 4) The Irrawaddy mainstream in the Central Dry Zone (the original high sediment yield area) has become less braided and some tributaries have become increasingly straightened, which are highly likely related to reductions in sediment supply and peak flow induced by dam construction ; 5) The large geomorphological adjustments at the two bifurcation points means that the diversions and fractions of water and sediment into the distributaries have likely already changed due to anthropogenic impacts. Our comprehensive analysis suggests that increasing human activities have caused reductions in coarse sediment supply entering the coastal delta plain, further inducing the erosion of the major channels in the lowermost delta and the western delta coast, and the adjustments of fluvial and coastal geomorphology; meanwhile, deforestation and terrestrial mining have provided extra fine sediment, which is mainly transported by the monsoon-driven current to the eastern coast to in part maintain its rapid accretion. Given the situation of rapidly increasing population and climate change, the current natural equilibrium state of the delta setting will most likely be disturbed in the near future. Therefore, our work calls for more intensive monitoring- and modeling-based study in order to better understand the controlling factors influencing the delta evolution in the future. ]\n","481\n","iteracion 482\n","[ Tsunami mitigation in Japan after the 2011 Tōhoku Tsunami ]\n","482\n","[ Since the Great East Japan Earthquake and the following Tōhoku Tsunami on March 11th, 2011, Japan has been facing a great challenge of the long-term and costly reconstruction of the impacted Tōhoku Coast, particularly in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima Prefectures, where the highest damage ratio was documented. The development of the recovery plans and the new tsunami mitigation strategies, aiming at more efficient protection from such future natural disasters, required in the first step revision of the performance and the efficiency of the tsunami countermeasures employed so far, consideration of the lessons learned from the reconstruction processes after past tsunami disasters as well as adjustment to specific regional conditions (e.g. society aging , diminishing population ratio, land availability, reconstruction visions preferred by local communities).

We studied daily variations in productivity at a nearshore station (25m depth) off Dichato, Chile (36°30′S) during January 1986 to understand how wind-driven variability in the hydrography is translated into pulses of primary and secondary production of the plankton. During the study period, we observed three complete cycles of upwelling favourable/unfavourable winds. Water column destratification, as indicated by the surface-to-bottom gradient of sigma-t, lagged the wind by about one day. During active upwelling, cold water (&lt;11.5°C) of high nitrate and low oxygen concentration (20–25μM and 1–2ml 1 −1 respectively) was found near the surface. During subsequent relaxation of upwelling, the water column became stratified as temperature, oxygen and chlorophyll increased. The size and taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton varied from one event to the next. Over the course of the study, from 15–100% of the chlorophyll could pass a 20μm mesh screen. Chain-forming diatoms, microflagellates, and the autotrophic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum dominated the first, second and third events, respectively. In rank order of abundance, Paracalanus parvus, Centropages brachiatus, Oithona spp., Acartia tonsa, Oncaea spp., Calanoides patagoniensis and Calanus chilensis dominated the copepod community. Changes in abundance of most species did not closely follow the upwelling cycle. Possibly, vertical movements or other behavioural responses caused zooplankton distributions to be uncorrelated with movements of the surface Ekman layer. Fecundity of several of the important copepod species was measured using the egg ratio and bottle incubation techniques. Compared to values reported in the literature, egg production was usually suboptimal, despite high nutritional quality of the phytoplankton, as indicated by protein/carbohydrate ratios. Food availability, due to either small phytoplankton size or spatial and temporal uncoupling of phyto- and zooplankton populations, was probably most important in limiting copepod production. Event-scale advection, both zonal and alongshore, can be important in uncoupling primary and secondary production and probably determines the degree to which upwelling-generated pulses of phytoplankton production are utilized by herbivorous plankton in the nearshore zone. ]\n","483\n","iteracion 484\n","[ An Integrated ecological–economic modeling framework for the sustainable management of oyster farming ]\n","484\n","[ Highlights Interdisciplinary approach to management of shellfish aquaculture Interconnections between ecology and society for holistic analyses of aquaculture Modeling framework for understanding trajectories of change amid global challenges , Sustainable resource management requires improved understanding of complex ecological processes and the socioeconomic drivers shaping human–environment interactions.

Geological and geomorphological landscape studies are critical to archaeology. Coastal regions provide a wide range of resources to the populations that inhabit them. Coastal landscapes are increasingly the focus of scholarly discussions from the earliest exploitation of littoral resources and early hominin cognition, to the inundation of the earliest permanently settled fishing villages and eventually, formative centres of urbanisation. In the Mediterranean, these would become hubs of maritime transportation that gave rise to the roots of modern seaborne trade. As such, this article represents an original review of both the geo-scientific and archaeological data that specifically relate to sea-level changes and resulting impacts on both physical and cultural landscapes from the Palaeolithic until the emergence of the Classical periods. Our review highlights that the interdisciplinary links between coastal archaeology, geomorphology and sea-level changes are important to explain environmental impacts on coastal human societies and human migration. We review geological indicators of sea level and outline how archaeological features are commonly used as proxies for measuring past sea levels, both gradual changes and catastrophic events. We argue that coastal archaeologists should, as a part of their analyses, incorporate important sea-level concepts, such as indicative meaning. The interpretation of the indicative meaning of Roman fishtanks, for example, plays a critical role in reconstructions of late Holocene Mediterranean sea levels. We identify avenues for future work, which include the consideration of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) in addition to coastal tectonics to explain vertical movements of coastlines, more research on Palaeolithic island colonisation , broadening of Palaeolithic studies to include materials from the entire coastal landscape and not just coastal resources, a focus on rescue of archaeological sites under threat by coastal change, and expansion of underwater archaeological explorations in combination with submarine geomorphology.

Threshold metrics can enhance coastal management and decision making, even under uncertainty with future climate change. , The impacts from climate change are increasing the possibility of vulnerable coastal species and habitats crossing critical thresholds that could spur rapid and possibly irreversible changes. For species of high conservation concern, improved knowledge of quantitative thresholds could greatly improve management. To meet this need, we synthesized information pertaining to biological responses as tipping points to sea level rise (SLR) and coastal storms for 45 fish, wildlife, and plant species along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and Caribbean through a literature review and expert elicitation. Although these species were selected based on their ecological, economic, and cultural importance, just over half (56%, n = 25) have quantitative threshold data currently available that can be used to assess the effects of SLR and storms during some aspect of their life history. Birds, reptiles, and plants represent the best studied coastal species. Thirteen of the species (29%) are projected to lose at least 50% of their population or habitat (e.g., foraging, nesting, spawning, or resting habitat) in some areas with a 0.5 m or greater rise in sea levels by 2100. Two species (a bird and reptile) may gain habitat from projected SLR and be resilient to future impacts. Numeric thresholds were not available for the remaining 20 species we searched for. Coastal fishes, mammals, and amphibians were among the groups representing a major information gap in this field of research. In addition, quantitative threshold responses to coastal storms were scarce for all taxa. While vulnerability assessments and qualitative research related to the impacts of SLR and storms on coastal species and habitats are increasing, work that incorporates quantitative thresholds as response and impact metrics remains limited.

Where mortality in tropical habitats has been documented, co-occurring stressors are typically implicated and the breakdown of mutualisms are evident. We suggest that a community and ecosystems perspective that integrates knowledge of organismal physiology with species interactions can reveal new insights into ecological feedbacks and the potential mechanisms that underlie the resilience of tropical ecosystems to deoxygenation. , The impacts of ocean deoxygenation on biodiversity and ecosystem function are well established in temperate regions , and here we illustrate how the study of hypoxia in tropical ecosystems can offer insights of general importance.

ECS shelf circulation between the 50 m and 100 m isobaths is attributed to the confluences of the northeastward Taiwan Strait Current (TSC) and Kuroshio intrusion over the shelf to the northeast of Taiwan. Although the relative importance and interaction of these two currents have not been well documented, the driving mechanisms underlying the northeastward TSC have been extensively studied in recent decades. The first set of long-term (2009–2011) observations showed that a stronger/weaker TSC (~2.37 Sv/~0.64 Sv) appears in summer/winter. However, the dynamics underlying the northeastward TSC against the northeasterly winds in winter are still debatable. The destination of the ECS shelf current in the formation of the Tsushima Warm Current is better understood. The volume transport of this current is ~2.67 Sv. The northeastward-flowing Taiwan Warm Current has two branches over the 50 m and 100 m isobaths.

In contrast, the present analysis takes a more expansive approach centered around the concept of intersectionality, to demonstrate more nuanced differences in terms of individuals’ access to resources for adaptation. We build on multiple Earth System Governance contextual conditions and research lenses to demonstrate that an intersectional approach allows greater understanding of gendered adaptation options impacted by various other factors. This must include investigations beyond the traditional gender binary, which we have sought to achieve in this study by using broader local and individualistic context to observe different communities. We compare gender intersectionality in case studies from India and Tanzania. The evidence demonstrates that intersectional factors vary, impacting adaptiveness to changing Anthropocene conditions, depending upon cross-cutting context-specific systems of hierarchy and discrimination. However, despite variation, we demonstrate there are common factors to be investigated across all locations when identifying possible intersectional impacts of ocean policy interventions, particularly wealth, marriage and family roles, and social networks. ]\n","492\n","iteracion 493\n","[ Effects of ammonium effluents on planktonic primary production and decomposition in a coastal brackish water environment.

Nitrogen removal is dominated by Anammox rather than denitrification during La Niña. Primary production is nutrient and temperature-limited during El Niño and La Niña respectively. Mesoscale eddy activity induces the removal of coastal nutrients offshore. Coastal upwelling centers are enhanced sources of nitrous oxide gas during La Niña. , The response of the ocean biogeochemistry to intense El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the Northern Humboldt Current System (NHCS) is assessed with an eddy-resolving coupled physical-biogeochemical model. El Niño (EN) 1997–1998 and La Niña (LN) 1999–2000 are well reproduced, inducing large spatial and temporal variability of biogeochemical properties at three coastal upwelling centers along the Peruvian coast (Chimbote 9.4°S, Callao 12.1°S, and Pisco 14°S). During EN, the upper limit of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) experiences an offshore displacement of, approximately, 60 km and a deepening of, approximately, 150 m when compared to neutral-ENSO conditions, thus ventilating the upper 100 m of the water column. In contrast, during LN, the OMZ tongue outcrops over the continental shelf deoxygenating the water column at all locations. During LN, at the southernmost location, enhanced Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) induces a leaking of the coastal nutrient inventory by horizontally advecting nitrogen from the nearshore region into the oligotrophic ocean. This leads to a reduction of biological production in the coastal zone. During EN, nitrification is an order of magnitude larger than denitrification in supplying the nitrite coastal pool. During LN peak, nitrification is reduced by 80%, while denitrification becomes equally important, evidencing a coupling between these two oxygen-dependent processes. The nitrogen removal due to suboxic activity is mostly controlled by the Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation (Anammox) in the southern domain during neutral-ENSO conditions. Our results show that during EN, denitrification contributes with 60% of the total nitrogen removal. In contrast, Anammox contributes with 70% during LN. The outgassing of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), an intermediate product of denitrification, is reduced and enhanced during EN and LN, respectively, and it is strongly modulated by the spatiotemporal variability of oxygen in the environment. ]\n","496\n","iteracion 497\n","[ Modeling global nutrient export from watersheds ]\n","497\n","[ We describe how global models can be used to analyze past and future trends in nutrient export from watersheds and how such models can be used to analyze causes and effects of coastal eutrophication.

Beach wrack and dredged sediments near the shores have affected the coastal ecosystem , badly. The piles of beach wrack residues might be a significant emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and dredged sediment is a substantial source of heavy metals and other pollutants . The recovery of valuable resources such as metals and nutrients from these so-called “wastes” is a sustainable strategy to enhance the resilience of the coastal ecosystem and management. The beach wrack meadows can be a potential source for green energy production. Even the demand for biodegradable polymers can be supplied by utilizing the waste beach wracks. The residues of beach wrack species like Posidonia oceanica, Zostera marina , Ulva spc. and Enhalus acorodies can be very beneficial species in terms of economic growth. Red algae have been the most favored and efficient candidate for methane yield. In case of dredged sediment, dewatering of sediment is an essential step for successful resource extraction. Although, extraction methods are almost similar to that applied for soil treatment, which includes pretreatment , physical partitioning, washing, thermal treatment, biological extraction, and immobilization . The fractionation study can be a beneficial tool for determining the metal species present in the sediment. Immobilization techniques are successful but continuous monitoring is required. The vitrification technique is highly effective but very expensive. Thermal treatment is useful for volatile metals such as mercury (Hg), but costs are high. Biological extractions are comparatively cheap but time-consuming.

Uploading the high-quality images of the manuscript figures. , Ocean Water Quality (OWQ) monitoring provides insights into the quality of water in marine and near-shore environments. OWQ measurements can contain the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of oceanic waters, where low OWQ values indicate an unhealthy ecosystem. Many parameters of water can be estimated from Remote Sensing (RS) data. Thus, RS offers significant opportunities for monitoring water quality in estuaries , coastal waterways, and the ocean. This paper reviews various RS systems and techniques for OWQ monitoring. It first introduces the common OWQ parameters, followed by the definition of the parameters and techniques of OWQ monitoring with RS techniques. In this study, the following OWQ parameters were reviewed: chlorophyll-a, colored dissolved organic matter, turbidity or total suspended matter/solid, dissolved organic carbon , Secchi disk depth, suspended sediment concentration, and sea surface temperature . This study presents a systematic analysis of the capabilities and types of spaceborne systems (e.g., optical and thermal sensors, passive microwave radiometers , active microwave scatterometers , and altimeters) which are commonly applied to OWQ assessment . The paper also provides a summary of the opportunities and limitations of RS data for spatial and temporal estimation of OWQ. Overall, it was observed that chlorophyll-a and colored dissolved organic matter are the dominant parameters applied to OWQ monitoring. It was also concluded that the data from optical and passive microwave sensors could effectively be applied to estimate OWQ parameters. From a methodological perspective, semi-empirical algorithms generally outperform the other empirical, analytical, and semi-analytical methods for OWQ monitoring. ]\n","500\n","iteracion 501\n","[ Heavy metal pollution in the East China Sea: A review ]\n","501\n","[ Highlights Heavy metal (HM) pollution in coastal areas of the East China Sea has been reviewed.

Molluscs have high levels of HMs. , Due to rapid urbanization and industrialization, heavy metal (HM) pollution in coastal areas of the East China Sea (ECS) has attracted extensive attention. This article attempts to review recent studies on the temporal and spatial distributions, ecological risks, and possible sources of HMs in typical bays and estuaries of ECS. The levels of HMs are closely related to local economic development and local characteristics. The anthropogenic activities and the particle size of sediments are important factors affecting the distribution of HMs. During the late 1970s to the 1990s, HMs levels in the Yangtze Estuary (YRE) sediments showed an upward tendency due to the increased emissions. However, HMs levels in the early 2000s were lower than that in the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. Cd caused serious pollution and brought potential ecological risks in the Yangtze Estuary, Hangzhou Bay (HZB), Sanmen Bay (SMB), and Quanzhou Bay (QZB).

On March 31, 2017, China issued the first regulation on the management of coastline protection and utilization. The focus of the regulation is the retention rate control system of natural coastline. The regulation requires ecological construction be conducted on the newly-formed coastline. An institutional system of the protection and utilization of China's coastline is established. , The coastline serves as a space carrier of marine economic development in coastal areas, and is an important platform for protecting marine environments and maintaining ecological balance. The integral components of a natural coastline have important ecological functions. In addition to the excessive economic development in China's coastal areas since the 1990s, other problems have occurred such as: a sharp decrease in natural coast due to the artificialization of mainland coastline, inefficient utilization of coastline resources by unplanned projects, weak legal enforcement by an imperfect management system, and impaired coastal functional value. By analyzing problems arising from the protection and utilization of China's coastline in the past 30 years, this paper reviews the relevant policies and regulations in China's marine administration. These issues are approached from the perspectives of an ecosystem, refined management of marine resources, scientific planning and natural coastline protection. The results indicate an improvement in the ecological environment through the introduction of multiple management systems. For instance, the natural coastline of China is currently decreasing at a rate slower than in 2008, and has a stable retention rate. Additionally, the over-exploitation of coastline has been curbed with a scientific and rational allocation of coastline resources; ecological problems such as coastal erosion , beach and coastal wetland degradation have been improved. The introduction of relevant policies, including, “Regulations on the Management of Coastline Protection and Utilization” fundamentally changed the passive decentralized management model. An initial institutional system that is in line with the protection and utilization status of China's coastline has been formed. Simultaneously, all levels of China's marine management departments are exploring and improving the coastline management system. Ultimately, this will provide valuable experience and practice in the protection and utilization of coastline for coastal countries across the world. ]\n","503\n","iteracion 504\n","[ Oceanic microplastics in Japan: A brief review on research protocol and present pollution ]\n","504\n","[ Highlights The status of microplastic (MP) pollution in Japan was reviewed.

In this review, we propose a new and complementary hypothesis describing the biophysical processes intervening in the recruitment of temperate fish larvae into estuaries . This new hypothesis, the Sense Acuity And Behavioral (SAAB) hypothesis, recognizes that recruitment is unlikely if the larvae drift passively with the water currents , and that successful recruitment requires the sense acuity of temperate fish larvae and their behavioral response to the estuarine cues present in coastal areas. We propose that temperate fish larvae use a hierarchy of sensory cues (odor, sound, visual and geomagnetic cues) to detect estuarine nursery areas and to aid during navigation towards these areas. The sensorial acuity increases along ontogeny , which coincides with increased swimming capabilities. The swimming strategies of post-flexion larvae differ from offshore areas to the tidal zone. In offshore areas, innate behavior might lead larvae towards the coast guided by a sun compass or by the earth's geomagnetic field . In areas under limited influence of estuarine plumes (either in energetic nearshore areas or offshore), post-flexion larvae display a searching swimming behavior for estuarine disconnected patches (infotaxis strategy). After finding an estuarine plume, larvae may swim along the increasing cue concentration to ingress into the estuary. Here, larvae exhibit a rheotaxis behavior and avoid displacement by longshore currents by keeping bearing during navigation. When larvae reach the vicinity of an estuary, merging diel rhythms with feeding and predator avoidance strategies with tidally induced movements is essential to increase their chances of estuarine ingress. A fish larva recruitment model developed for the Ria Formosa lagoon supports the general framework of the SAAB hypothesis. In this model, the ingress of virtual Sparidae temperate larvae into this nursery area increases from 1.5% to 32.1% when directional swimming guided by estuarine cues is included as a forcing parameter. ]\n","509\n","iteracion 510\n","[ An overview of beach-cast seaweeds: Potential and opportunities for the valorization of underused waste biomass ]\n","510\n","[ There is an extensive demand for new sources of natural products with biofunctional properties, in which macroalgae can be relevant components to encounter this need. Nowadays, there are no commercial-scale alga crops to supply the biomass market for exploitation in some countries. The high availability of beach-cast seaweed biomass with potential application makes them an attractive and sustainable alternative to satisfy this demand. Currently, the excess of beach-cast seaweeds on the beaches causes an environmental problem, as its decomposition affects the use of the beach and keeps tourists and bathers away, affecting financial income in the region. Considering this negative impact on the environment and the possibility of using this biological feedstock , some countries establish quotas that make it possible to reduce the volume and maintain the stock in the environment. This review aims to gather information on studies related to beach-cast marine algae in the world and Brazil, addressing ecological, economic, and potential applications. The exploitation of beach-cast algae can be a socio-economic and environmentally sustainable solution, since it reduces financial costs, generates an alternative income for the local population, and limits the impact of extraction on natural beds of macroalgae , threatened by over-exploitation. The relevance of this material is shown by gathering information on the prospecting of the biomass given the development of technology for algae matrices with a focus on the development of functional products and sustainable use of unexplored biomass considered as waste. The use of beach-cast seaweeds as a resource is an eco-efficient alternative that favors society and the environment, generating usable resources that were previously seen as limited and trash.

No consensus has been reached on the definition of the HWM worldwide. The position of the HWM is influenced by a number of factors. Advantages and disadvantages exist in different HWM definitions. The corresponding capture methods vary among different HWM definitions. , The High Water Mark (HWM) is an important cadastral boundary that separates land and water. It is also used as a baseline to facilitate coastal hazard management from which land and infrastructure development is offset to ensure the protection of property from storm surge and sea level rise . The determination of the HWM has a long history. Its definition, the mean and even the corresponding determination methods have changed through time. In addition, the location of the HWM is difficult to define accurately due to the ambulatory nature of water and coastal morphology variations. To better understand the HWM determination, this paper reviews the development of the definition of HWM, including ordinary high water mark (OHWM), mean high water mark (MHWM), mean high water spring (MHWS) and mean higher high water (MHHW), and the existing HWM indicators, such as vegetation line and beach morphological features. Two common methods of HWM determination, field survey and remote sensing , are discussed in this paper. This is followed by the investigation of the possible factors that influence the variation of the HWM position. Furthermore, an overview of the ambulatory nature of both water and coastal morphology, which contributes to the difficulties in HWM determination, is provided. Finally, the limitations of previous determination methods and future direction in HWM determination studies are also discussed.

In the estuarine region, the amounts in solution are smaller than in suspension for pentachlorobenzen, hexachlorobenzene and PCB, dissolved concentrations dominating for the hexachlorocyclohexane isomers. In river water, PCB is roughly equally distributed over dissolved and suspended forms while pentachlorobenzene, hexachlorobenzene and the HCHs dominate in solution. Dissolved dieldrin, endrin and p,p′-DDD were below the limits of detection in most river water samples. However dissolved dieldrin and endrin are produced in the upper part of the estuary resulting from local pollution. During estuarine mixing, dissolved concentrations of all compounds were found to be linearly related to salinity (1974 data). Concentration data in seston and sediment in the estuarine region can be explained in terms of mixing of fluviatile and marine derived particles. It is suggested that in particular PCBs are associated specifically with finer particles. Dissolved concentrations in the central part of the Southern Bight are at the very lower end of the range of values reported for various coastal and open ocean areas. Concentrations detected in large volume samples are: penta- and hexachlorobenzene 0.1 ng·1 −1 ; PCB (Aroclor 1254) 0.7 ng·1 −1 ; α-HCH 0.9 ng·1 −1 ; γ-HCH 1.0 ng·1 −1 ; β-HCH 0.04 ng·1 −1 ; dieldrin 0.1 ng·1 −1 and endrin and p,p′-DDD &lt; 0.01 ng·1 −1 . Temperature programmed GLC techniques demonstrate the contribution of lower chlorinated PCB components in the central part of the Bight. This has not been observed in other reports. Adoption of a PCB formulation with a lower degree of chlorination than the usual Aroclor 1254 as the standard for quantitation results in a significant shift of the PCB concentrations from 0.7 (Aroclor 1254 or the equivalent Clophen A50) to 4.1 ng·1 −1 (Clophen A30). It is suggested that the lower chlorinated fraction is derived from atmospheric input. River water could not be excluded as a source however. Concentrations in the coastal area are higher than in the central part of the Southern Bight.

This scoping review aims to synthesize evidence from relevant studies centred on South Asia, identify research gaps specifically focused on children and women's health, and contribute to knowledge about South Asia's existing mitigation and adaptation strategies. Methods A research librarian executed the search on six databases using controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH, Emtree, etc.) and keywords representing the concepts “vulnerable populations” and “climate change” and “health impacts” and “South Asia.” Databases were searched from January 2010 to May 2020. Papers were screened independently by two researchers. Results Forty-two studies were included, of which 23 were based in India, 14 in Bangladesh, and five in other South Asian countries. Nineteen studies focused on meteorological factors as the primary exposure. In contrast, thirteen focused on extreme weather events, nine on air pollution, and one on salinity in coastal areas. Thirty-four studies focused on the health impacts on children related to extreme weather events, meteorological factors, and air pollution, while only eight studies looked at health impacts on women. Undernutrition, ARI (acute respiratory infection), diarrheal diseases, low birth weight, and premature mortality were the major health impacts attributed to extreme weather events, meteorological factors, and air pollution exposure in children and women in the region. Conclusion Extreme weather events, meteorological factors and air pollution have affected the health of children and women in South Asia. However, the gap in the literature across the South Asian countries concerning relationships between exposure to extreme weather events, meteorological factors, air pollution and health effects, including mental health problems in children and women, are opportunities for future work. ]\n","513\n","iteracion 514\n","[ Applications of deep learning in water quality management: A state-of-the-art review ]\n","514\n","[ Highlights Water quality (WQ) management using deep learning (DL) approaches reviewed critically.

Importance of the IoT and cloud computing towards DL-based WQ management outlined. , Excellent water quality (WQ) is an indispensable element in ensuring sustainable water resource development. It is highly associated with the 3rd (good health and well-being), the 6th (clean water and sanitation), and the 14th (life below water) listed items of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Thus, policymakers have always been seeking strategies to manage WQ efficiently. Recent advancements in computational technologies have created enthusiasm for using artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning (DL), in WQ management. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of DL in WQ management, covering developments from 2011 to 2022, in maintaining the temporal relevance of this review. In this paper, a brief description of different variants of DL models, including the recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), etc, are presented. The distinct approaches in the optimization, hybridization and relevant data pre-processing techniques suitable for the DL models, are also discussed. This is the first review paper that extensively discusses the application of DL models for forecasting WQ parameters in various water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, coastal areas, etc. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing that revolutionized DL approaches in WQ management are also presented. This review paper serves as a complete easy guideline for the researchers in the field of DL-based WQ management. The findings of this review paper may help policymakers to enhance their decision-making process with the hope that regional environmental welfare can drastically be improved. ]\n","514\n","iteracion 515\n","[ Synergistic benefits of conserving land-sea ecosystems ]\n","515\n","[ Mangroves , seagrasses, and coral reefs interact in tropical regions throughout the world.

While only an estimated 18% of interaction zones are covered by protected areas, boundaries between mangroves, seagrasses, and reefs represent areas of high conservation efficiency, where benefits of conservation amplify synergistically as land-sea ecosystems are jointly managed. We discuss four types of conservation efficiencies in these coastal ecosystems : (1) increased resistance to disturbance through inter-ecosystem feedbacks, (2) high biodiversity within small geographic areas, (3) habitat portfolio effects giving rise to climate refugia , and (4) synergistic ecosystem services, where building one ecosystem service inherently increases others. Given these synergistic benefits, global campaigns to expand marine and terrestrial protection should focus on the tightly connective interface between mangroves, seagrasses, and reefs, in order to more efficiently build resilience within and between these habitats. ]\n","515\n","iteracion 516\n","[ Seaweed: A potential climate change solution ]\n","516\n","[ Highlights Seaweed sequesters blue carbon and is a climate change solution. Seaweed-based regenerative ocean farming can efficiently restore marine ecosystems. Seaweed is a good source of protein and bioactive compounds for human and animal consumption. Seaweed has the potential to be a future source of energy and renewable plastics. Seaweed offers coastal nations a viable source of revenue and a bioeconomy option. , Climate change and environmental deterioration have spurred a blue carbon economic model in which fuel and food may be produced from marine ecosystems through the processes of carbon sequestration , carbon storage, and carbon harvest to substitute fossil products. This review discusses the potential of seaweed as a blue carbon sink and a renewable and sustainable energy source in the biogenic carbon cycle in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies . Data were collected from more than 100 scientific articles, reliable organizations, and industry resources to a concise explanation and novel perspective on how seaweed can contribute considerably to the newly emerging blue carbon economy and revolutionary tools to combat climate change in the long term. According to the findings, seaweed has all the features required to be classified as a blue carbon habitat and a massive carbon sink. Besides its function in climate change adaptation and mitigation, seaweed is also a prelude to attaining a bioeconomy by lowering the reliance on fossil fuel. Documented evidence supports various applications in sectors as diverse as human meals, livestock feed, biofuels, and renewable feedstocks . However, the literature also identifies barriers to the implementation of seaweed farming operations. This review provides evidence that seaweed farming and industries are potential alternatives for future energy, decarbonization, and food security, mitigating global climate change and attaining economic growth and sustainable livelihoods. ]\n","516\n","iteracion 517\n","[ The lower shoreface: Morphodynamics and sediment connectivity with the upper shoreface and beach ]\n","517\n","[ The lower shoreface provides the connection between the continental shelf and the shoreline via its onshore transition called the upper shoreface. Lower shorefaces are diverse, and range from bedrock-controlled, through sediment-starved to sediment-rich, siliciclastic, carbonate, low to high wave-energy, microtidal to macrotidal, and are variably affected by storm and wind-driven flows. The lower shoreface can be a repository for deposits of terrestrial origin , and a zone of active carbonate production. It can therefore be an important source of sediment for beaches, dunes , estuaries , and tidal basins. There has been progress in the ability to predict suspended sediment transport under non-breaking and shoaling waves across the lower shoreface. However, high-resolution measurement of sediment transport over unknown seabed configurations with unpredictable bed-level changes under hydrodynamic conditions that are unknown at the outset, and especially involving bedload transport, is still faced with significant challenges. Non-linear interactions between processes contributing to sediment transport render calculations and modelling of transport directions and magnitudes uncertain, and the spatial and temporal scales of transport are much larger than those of the upper shoreface. On the other hand, transport rates and morphological change may be much smaller on the lower shoreface compared to the upper shoreface. Another challenge is the upscaling of short-term measurements to explain the long-term morphological evolution of the lower shoreface. This limited understanding implies that current paradigms of lower shoreface dynamics based on morphological equilibrium and disequilibrium relative to the ocean-forcing conditions may be too simplistic, though possibly appropriate over long timescales (decades to millennia), and modelling work and prediction of change no more than exploratory. Over such long timescales, boundary conditions (sea level, wave climate) are likely to change. Making way forward on these issues is important for understanding the connectivity between the lower shoreface and beach recovery after major storm erosion, and for estimating coastal sediment budgets , short- to long-term coastal change and response to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. At geological timescales, the lower shoreface is a central element in tracking shoreline changes . Progress is needed in measuring sediment transport and upscaling to timescales compatible with lower shoreface change. It is also important to take advantage of on-going rapid progress in seabed and shallow stratigraphic mapping, bed-level changes, including remote-sensing approaches, for a better understanding of lower shoreface morphodynamics and sediment connectivity with the coast. This includes the now routine identification of large subaqueous bedforms , possibly ubiquitous features on the world's continental shelves, their mobility over time, and their potential link with the shoreline . The common relationship between fine sand, dissipative beaches and large aeolian dunes also poses the question of how fine sand is abundantly supplied from the lower shoreface, given the common perception that it is readily swept offshore on beaches. These multi-theme challenges need to be addressed in order to advance our understanding of the lower shoreface and its connectivity with the upper shoreface and beach. ]\n","517\n","iteracion 518\n","[ Freshwater blue space and population health: An emerging research agenda ]\n","518\n","[ Highlights Freshwater is often overlooked in blue space and health research. Lakes, rivers and canals will likely differ in their health promoting capability. More nuanced spatial approaches are required to quantify exposure to freshwater. Key research needs are identified to advance understanding of freshwater blue-health. , Growing evidence suggests that access and exposure to water bodies or blue spaces can provide a variety of health and well-being benefits. Attempts to quantify these ‘blue-health’ benefits have largely focused on coastal environments, with freshwater blue spaces receiving far less attention despite over 50% of the global population living within 3 km of a body of freshwater and populations living in landlocked areas having limited coastal access. This critical review identifies opportunities to improve our understanding of the relationship between freshwater blue space and health and well-being and outlines key recommendations to broaden the portfolio of emerging research needs associated with the field of blue-health. Recognising fundamental distinctions in relationships between health outcomes and access and exposure to freshwater versus coastal blue space is critical and further research is required to determine the mechanisms that link exposure to freshwater blue space with tangible health outcomes and to understand how such mechanisms vary across a range of freshwater environments . Furthermore, methodological improvements are necessary as spatial approaches adopted to quantify access and exposure to freshwater blue space often fail to account for the unique physical characteristics of freshwater and come with a variety of limitations. Based on the findings of this review, a suite of research needs are proposed, which can be categorised into three broad themes: (i) establishing a freshwater blue-health methodological framework; (ii) advancing the empirical freshwater blue-health evidence base; and (iii) promoting freshwater blue-health opportunities. When taken together, these research themes offer opportunities to advance current understanding and better integrate freshwater blue space into the wider nature-health research agenda. ]\n","518\n","iteracion 519\n","[ Biodiversity and stakeholder participation ]\n","519\n","[ Consensus building through stakeholder participation is a promising new trend that takes into account the interactive character of the communication process.

Through the application of this concept, many Earth scientists have assessed the roles of focal species in modulating landscape formation and dynamics. No species, however, lives or evolves in isolation; moreover, few species exist without any engineering effects on their ambient environment. Based on these basic premises, it appears unlikely that any landform on Earth (except, for example, hyperarid desert dunes , recent lava flows , and glacial grooves) exclusively represents the engineering impact of a single species. Thus, surface topography, to some degree, can generally be a combined expression of ≥ two species that mutually interact with each other through their own engineering activities. The purpose of the present research was to review, refine, and expand upon the original ecosystem engineering concept to make it more inclusive and comprehensive. Accordingly, a new concept has been proposed here, the windows of combined ecosystem engineering (WoCEE), to indicate the range within which the relative importance of engineering effects for ≥ two species changes along a gradient, as defined by various abiotic and biotic factors. In support of this novel idea, real-world examples are presented, including ecological succession in terrestrial and coastal dune ecosystems, crab–plant interactions on tidal wetlands, pocket gopher–plant relationships in the grasslands, and biological invasions by exotic mollusks and macrophytes . Notably, there are likely various other examples in nature, provided the spatiotemporal scales at which multiple species play their bioengineering roles correspond to those at which landforms are shaped. This framework represents an important step forward in the realization of true ecosystem engineering and will potentially serve as a unifying theme of biogeomorphology. ]\n","520\n","iteracion 521\n","[ Integrating ecological perspectives into engineering practices – Perspectives and lessons from Japan ]\n","521\n","[ This article focuses on how ecosystem-based approaches could be mainstreamed in recovery and reconstruction after large scale, rare and infrequent coastal hazards.

The framework in which seepage meters have been used in marine settings has evolved in parallel to the understanding of submarine groundwater discharge. This review of seepage meter research shows: an uneven distribution of studies in the world with some densely-studied regions and an absolute lack of data in other regions; a dominance of studies where only seepage meters were used compared to studies that combined seepage meter measurements with values determined with radioactive tracers or hydraulic calculations; and a variety of publication outlets with different focuses (hydrology, oceanography or multidisciplinary). The historical overview of the research conducted with seepage meters shows the wide range of seepage meter applications – from simply measuring fluxes at local scales to larger studies that extrapolate local results to estimate fluxes of water, nutrients, and other solutes at regional and global scales. A variety of automated seepage meters have been developed and used to better characterize short-term groundwater-seawater exchange, including the effects of waves and tides.

Fish, bird, and invertebrates mostly recover within five years. Systems can still exhibit variation from reference habitats up to 130 years post breach. Breaching of embankments often restores conditions that are more natural and increases estuary similarity to reference systems. , Breaching of coastal causeways and dikes (embankments) is a common method used to restore estuaries and marshes to a more natural state. Here, we reviewed literature pertaining to embankment breaches to assess the effectiveness of this restoration method and to provide practical advice for future breaches. While all methods of embankment breaching can be successful, active measures appear to be more successful than allowing breaches to occur naturally. Restoring tidal flow sooner, and to a greater degree, will speed recovery of impacted systems. Overall, recovery is often quick, with hydrology changing immediately. Sedimentation and erosion patterns also change soon after breaching, but it can take up to 15 years for sediment elevation to stabilize, and 60–100 years for equilibrium conditions to develop. Marsh plant communities recover rapidly, with most systems almost fully recovering within 5–20 years. Fish, bird, and invertebrate communities also mostly recover within five years. Unfortunately, recovery is often not complete. Even with large investments of time and money, systems can still exhibit variation from reference habitats in their biotic and abiotic conditions up to 130 years post breach. In some cases, this may be due to embankment remnants still impacting the system. Conversely, the systems may have changed too much, and/or global climate change may have altered successional pathways to such a degree that recovery to pre-disturbance conditions is unlikely. Regardless, breaching of coastal embankments often restores conditions that are more natural and increases estuary similarity to reference systems. As such, breaching is a useful prescription for coastal restoration, one that can deliver a considerable return on investment . ]\n","523\n","iteracion 524\n","[ On the potential synergies and applications of wave energy converters: A review ]\n","524\n","[ Highlights Wave energy advance faces technology maturity, survivability and cost challenges.

Ecosystem resilience approaches can be used to guide research and policy. , The global issues of climate change and marine litter are interlinked and understanding these connections is key to managing their combined risks to marine biodiversity and ultimately society. For example, fossil fuel-based plastics cause direct emissions of greenhouse gases and therefore are an important contributing factor to climate change, while other impacts of plastics can manifest as alterations in key species and habitats in coastal and marine environments. Marine litter is acknowledged as a threat multiplier that acts with other stressors such as climate change to cause far greater damage than if they occurred in isolation.

The subduction is followed by the oblique collision between the Luzon arc and the subducting Eurasian plate from 6.5 Ma. The North Luzon Trough forearc strata and the Luzon arc are then obducted northwestward as the Coastal Range, eastern Taiwan, in the last 1 Ma. The collision propagates southward and is presently active in the region offshore SE Taiwan. Integrating seismic surveys offshore and a detailed forearc stratigraphy study onshore the Coastal Range, this paper overviews the characteristics of forearc deformation, dynamic sequence stratigraphy , temporal-spatial variations of forearc sedimentation and stratigraphic correlation onshore and offshore forearc sequences in response to the oblique convergent tectonics north of 20°N. Combining onshore and offshore forearc geology together allows us to reconstruct a structural evolution of the North Luzon Trough forearc basin from subduction through collision to obduction , and to discuss the mechanism and processes responsible for developments of the modern-forming forearc Lichi Mélange during the active Taiwan orogeny . Seismic surveys offshore show that forearc deformation in the subduction zone is primarily caused by increase of rear prism slope and west-vergent thrusting of forearc strata along the prism top since the early forearc sedimentation. East-vergent backthrusting occurs during the late forearc sedimentation and propagates arcward when the volcanic arc collides with the accretionary prism in the collision zone . Bivergent thrusting leads to a development of the forearc Huatung Ridge popup as a bathymetric high which further controls the sedimentation of the younger forearc sequence in the collision zone . In response to the syn -sedimentation deformation, forearc depocenter shifts progressively eastward. Forearc stratigraphy thus changes from two mega-sequences bounded by an unconformity in the subduction zone to three mega-sequences juxtaposed from west to east unconformably in the collision zone. As a consequence, the forearc deformation and stratigraphy in the oblique collision zone off SE Taiwan show a characteristic temporal-spatial pattern that the lowest mega-sequence with the most intensive deformation occurs restrictedly in the west, whiles the middle and the upper mega-sequences with mild deformation crop out in the center and the eastern part of the forearc basin , respectively. Detailed biostratigraphy study using planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannoplanktons indicates that the forearc strata onshore the Coastal Range are also composed of three sequences (lower unit S-1: 6.5–5.8 Ma; middle unit S-2: 5.8–3.0 Ma; and upper unit S-3: &lt;3.0–1 Ma). They were previously mapped as lithostratigraphy units of the Lichi Mélange (6.5–3.0 Ma) in the west and the coherent flysch sequences of the Fanshuliao Formation (5.8–3.0 Ma) and the Paliwan Formation (&lt;3.0–1 Ma) in the east. However, the young coherent forearc sequences in the east thrust westward ubiquitously over the old and highly deformed Lichi Mélange in the west along the listric east-dipping Tuluanshan fault during the obduction . Detailed biostratigraphy study reveals that the lower sequence unit S-1 exposes restrictedly in the Lichi Mélange west of the Tuluanshan fault, whereas the middle sequence unit S-2 are either mapped as part of the Lichi Mélange or the coherent Fanshuliao Formation in both sides of the Tuluanshan fault, respectively. The upper sequence unit S-3 exposes exclusively east of middle sequence unit S-2 in the eastern Coastal Range. Stratigraphy and sedimentology study also reveals a temporal-spatial sedimentation variation of the upper sequence unit S-3 owing to deformation of the sequence units S-1 and S-2 together as a Pliocene Forearc Ridge at ~3 Ma, a scenario analog to development of the modern Huatung Ridge at ~1 Ma in active collision zone offshore. Temporal-spatial pattern of forearc sequences onshore the Coastal Range suggests that these three sequence units are juxtaposed from west to east and are bounded by two unconformities analog to what occur today in the collision zone offshore SE Taiwan. The characteristic deformation and an eastward-youngling trend of strata distribution onshore the Coastal Range all indicate Syn-sedimentation deformation during the oblique collision in 6.5–1 Ma. Furthermore, along the N-S orogenic strike, events of the forearc sedimentation and bivergent thrusting occur earlier onshore the obduction zone in the north than the modern collision zone offshore in the south. Across the orogenic strike forearc strata get older and deformation gets intensive from east to west onshore the Coastal Range, a scenario analog to what observed in the oblique convergent region offshore SE Taiwan. A structure reconstruction reveals that the North Luzon Trough forearc strata have experienced multiple stages of thrust deformation from subduction through collision to obduction. These deformations account for the mechanism and processes to develop the modern-forming highly sheared SSZ-bearing forearc Lichi Mélange tectonically in the western Coastal Range during the last 1 Ma. ]\n","532\n","iteracion 533\n","[ Effects of ammonium effluents on planktonic primary production and decomposition in a coastal brackish water environment I.

Sampled were the inner archipelago loaded with ammonium-rich industry effluents and some stations towards the open sea. Acute effects of effluent on natural algal and bacterial communities were tested by measurements of primary productivity and heterotrophic activity. Effluent tests were also conducted with a test alga ( Chorella sp.). Nutrient ratios and AGP tests indicated that nitrogen was the principal limiting nutrient for algal growth even in the ammonium-loaded regions. Therefore, the discharge causes a considerable eutrophication in the area. Effluent concentrations from 0.01 to 1% stimulated primary productivity of natural algal communities up to 230% of the control, whereas 10% concentrations were toxic. Test algae tolerated also 10% of effluent in some cases, and showed stimulations up to 960% of the control. No stimulation of heterotrophic activity was usually detected in effluent tests, and the threshold of toxicity was considerably lower than with algae. The effect of effluents on heterotrophic bacteria of the water body is therefore likely to be mediated through autotrophic production. ]\n","533\n","iteracion 534\n","[ The phytoplankton spring bloom in Dutch coastal waters of the North Sea ]\n","534\n","[]\n","534\n","iteracion 535\n","[ Vulnerability to climate change of hypersaline salt marshes in the Northern Gulf of California ]\n","535\n","[ Highlights We review existing scientific information on climate change impacts for salt marshes.

Uncertainty and data gaps preclude detailed projections of climate effects. Existing data can be used to design management actions that consider uncertainty. , The ecosystem functions and environmental services provided by coastal wetlands are threatened by climate change and other anthropogenic impacts. Assessing the degree of vulnerability and the nature and extent of probable impacts of climate change on coastal wetlands is necessary to develop adaptation strategies. Here we review and synthesize existing scientific information to examine climate change impacts on physical and biotic processes of hypersaline salt marshes in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico. In this region, negative estuaries provide nursery and refuge for migratory species and sustain important fisheries. We found marshes in the Northern Gulf may be susceptible to the effects increased CO 2 , sea-level rise, storm frequency and intensity, changes in ambient temperature, and ocean physical changes, including elevated sea temperature, and acidification . The responses of coastal marshes to these climate change effects will likely be interactive and hard to predict; climatic interannual variability (i.e. El Niño-Southern Oscillation) will play an important role in determining the strength and directionality of the impacts. Given the uncertainty of climate change effects, it will be important to continue ongoing monitoring programs and implement new ones that help separate natural variability from the effects of climate change. Management actions and adaptation plans will be needed that consider uncertainty, are flexible, and encourage ongoing learning. Our study is a first step toward understanding vulnerability of coastal wetlands in the Northern Gulf of California to climate change. ]\n","535\n","iteracion 536\n","[ Dynamics of primary production and sedimentation in a coastal ecosystem ]\n","536\n","[ Production in relation to sedimentation in the mesohaline shallow water ecosystem of Kiel Bight was studied from February to June 1980. Plankton biomass and production were at their lowest during winter and sedimentation was a function of resuspension. Highest plankton biomass recorded during the period was at the height of the spring diatom bloom in mid-March. Zooplankton biomass remained low and the bulk of the phytoplankton (≈ 10 g C · m −2 ) sedimented out of the water column by early April. Thereafter, zooplankton biomass increased with a distinct reciprocal relationship between protozooplankton and metazooplankton and an increasing diversification in feeding types. Loss rates by sedimentation were lowest in the presence of a large zooplankton standing stock indicating efficient recycling of essential elements within the pelagic system. Development of the pelagic system during the investigation period is divided into three stages in terms of solar radiation and transport energy. A winter period with low radiation and thoroughly mixed water column, a spring bloom with similar radiation and lessened mixing of the water column, and a period of maturation of the pelagic system with increasing radiation and stratification. ]\n","536\n","iteracion 537\n","[ Evaluation of ecological engineering of “armoured” shorelines to improve their value as habitat ]\n","537\n","[ People have caused major impacts on nearshore and intertidal habitats by building infrastructure associated with shipping, recreation, residential and commercial developments. Together with the desire or need to control erosion , these have led to increased “armouring” of intertidal shorelines , with seawalls, revetments , onshore and offshore groynes and other defence systems, piers and docks replacing natural habitats. Despite the long history of such changes, until relatively recently there had been limited research on the impacts of such alterations to shorelines, especially when compared to research into effects of urbanisation on terrestrial habitats. In addition, most research to date has focussed on the impacts of such changes on the ecological structure of assemblages, i.e. the numbers and types of organisms affected, rather than on ecological processes. With the realisation that most coastal infrastructure cannot be removed, there is now an increasing research effort into ways that infrastructure can be built to meet engineering requirements, but to also increase its value as habitat – ecological engineering. In this review, we discuss the major impacts and the experimental research that has been and is being done to build coastal infrastructure in a more biodiversity-friendly manner. Much of the review has focussed on seawalls, which is where most of the experimental work has been done to date.

SGE infrastructure will alter local hydrodynamics and become colonized. , Marine renewable energy development aims to harness the vast resources of the coastal environment to meet growing energy demands. Among the variety of coastal energy sources, salinity gradient energy (SGE) technology captures the energy released from the controlled mixing of waters of different salinities found naturally in estuarine systems or in other combinations of anthropogenic sources of brine and fresh waters. Although SGE technology is in the pilot stage of development, there is currently no comprehensive published assessment of its environmental impacts. This assessment uses research from proxy facilities and pilot SGE projects to predict impacts of an SGE facility through construction, operation and decommission phases. Construction and decommission of an SGE facility is expected to disrupt habitat and organisms via noise, land modification, and release of pollutants, similar to other coastal facilities such as desalination plants or water intake cooling structures. During operation, however, impacts unique to SGE result from intake of both high- and low-salinity waters, which in natural sources will involve impingement , entrainment, and chemical treatment to reduce biofouling. In addition, SGE effluent is expected to be of lower salinity and higher volume than effluent from a desalination plant, thereby posing unique risks to discharge sites.

In general terms, the Pacific coast is tectonic, and therefore, earthquakes and tsunamis are likely to occur in this area. The Caribbean coast is constantly subject to trade winds and episodically to hurricanes and tsunami-triggered waves. The Atlantic coasts of Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina suffer the action of storm surges coming from the south (southeasterlies). At the same time, the South American coast is particularly exposed to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-triggered effects. These effects are different in different regions. In Colombia the seasonal increase of the mean sea level alters the dynamics of barrier islands. In Peru, ENSOs are responsible for sudden inputs of sediments to the coast; similar processes impact the estuarine complexes of Lagoa dos Patos (southern Brazil) or Paraná-Rio de la Plata floods (Argentina–Uruguay). In northern Brazil, on the other hand, dry conditions induce the migration of dunes landward. In several countries of South America, population is concentrated at or near the coast, and therefore some natural coastal processes increase their impacts.

A fundamental problem in shore process studies is that of integrating scale differences, notably within the perspective of large-scale coastal behavior. Furthermore, processes operating on the shore are characterized by temporal continuity, but with variations in intensity and frequency that may be periodic, as for tides; completely aperiodic, as in the case of storms and tsunamis; or possibly involving some form of cyclic behavior, as for El Nino/La Nina-type events. The temporal continuity implies that the domain of operation of such processes may shift in space and that aspect of frequency and intensity may become modulated by these shifts and changes in the lower-order generating mechanisms such as those involved in global change. ]\n","544\n","iteracion 545\n","[ Highlights from a review of microplastics in marine sediments ]\n","545\n","[ Highlights MPs in marine sediments have been published in at least 70 articles, at a total of 813 locations on all continents. Areas studied are mainly in coastal environments, and the number of locations examined per study ranges from 1 to 72. We recommend the use of a NaCl solution for the separation step. A digestion step using an H 2 O 2 solution and automatic identification are recommended , The ubiquity of microplastics (MPs) has now been demonstrated throughout Earth's geographic areas in both terrestrial and marine environments. Marine ecosystems are the end point of the plastic waste cycle, and marine sediments are increasingly considered to be a sink for plastic debris, with possible deleterious effects on seafloor ecosystems. However, the low concentration of MPs in a complex matrix such as marine sediment makes their reliable analysis difficult. MP concentration in marine sediments is usually determined by various extraction procedures followed by optical, spectroscopy or mass spectrometry techniques, and are therefore hard to compare. Therefore, reliable determination of MPs in sediment is a challenging task. Here we present a short review on studies dealing with analytical determination protocols and MP detection in marine sediments and discuss the advantages of the different techniques used. This analysis of the literature reveals that most of the 70 studies were carried out in European and Asian coastal environments. The use of NaCl saturated solution, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are by far the most-used techniques for the different steps of separation, digestion and identification, respectively. Based on this body of literature, we present recommendations and suggestions for future research in order to increase the reliability of results and to facilitate inter-comparison. The use of NaCl saturated and H 2 O 2 solution is strongly recommended for the separation and digestion steps, respectively, whereas during the filtration step it is necessary to choose filter type based on the identification technique. More thorough investigation is needed to establish a systematic protocol for MP identification. A combination of techniques would permit to identify all items, and personal bias could be avoided if automatic identification was implemented.

In the field of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and the design and implementation of early warning systems (EWS) the integration of local knowledge with scientific knowledge has been viewed as a way of operationalising the active engagement of communities. This systematic review and evidence synthesis examined deliberate, researcher-initiated, efforts to integrate local and scientific knowledge within the context of DRR and EWS, exploring the motivations for knowledge integration, the processes of knowledge integration and the outcomes of these processes. Twenty empirical studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. The results indicate that the motivations for knowledge integration derived from real life challenges, that is, that top down DRR measures had not been adopted by local communities and that the knowledge of local or scientific communities in isolation was unable to manage disaster risk. Furthermore, knowledge integration was seen to empower communities and produce DRR interventions that were responsive to local needs and sensitivities. The processes of knowledge integration were participatory and interactive, and a range of outcomes were generated within the context of participatory projects. Nevertheless, neither the processes nor the outcomes of knowledge integration had been formally evaluated. Participatory processes of knowledge integration and evaluation of processes and outcomes need to be considered carefully during the design of the research, allowing for necessary time and the inclusion of appropriate expertise. ]\n","546\n","iteracion 547\n","[ Managed realignment: A sediment management perspective ]\n","547\n","[ Managed realignment has many potential benefits but has attracted most attention as a conservation management tool in the UK. It has been used to create new habitat either as a broad-scale biodiversity gain, or as a measure specifically to offset losses to commercial developments. This has focussed attention on only one part of the role realignment plays in coastal management rather than its broader significance in restoring accommodation space and the policy significance of this attribute. This paper draws attention to the relationship between coastal erosion and the role accommodation space plays in husbandry of sediment supplies. Inadequate accommodation space leads to loss of sediment that cannot be readily replaced. Loss of sediment has long-term implications for coastal evolution and the degree to which coastal evolution maintains an economically sustainable coastal environment. This paper argues that attention must shift away from nature conservation outcomes as the primary policy driver for managed realignment in the UK and in Europe. Instead, there are sound engineering and social reasons for greater emphasis on realignment but to make this happen there has to be a reduction in the emphasis on wildlife and a much greater focus on engineering and water management. Relatively small policy adjustments are needed but a much more profound change in presentation is needed so that decision-makers and stakeholders pay more attention to the engineering need for realignment. ]\n","547\n","iteracion 548\n","[ Artificial marine habitats in the Arabian Gulf: Review of current use, benefits and management implications ]\n","548\n","[ The use of artificial reefs in the Arabian Gulf have a history extending back over a century, when date palm trunks, stones, pottery and other materials were sunk in coastal areas to enhance fish catch.

The most widely recognized are purpose-build modular artificial reefs designed for the enhancement of fisheries yield, diving, and various other benefits. However, far more common within the Gulf are the large-scale unplanned artificial reefs that have been formed as a result of human activities in the marine system, such as large-scale coastal breakwaters, seawalls, jetties, pipelines, and oil and gas infrastructure. Although there is limited information on the role of these constructions in structuring Gulf marine communities, increasing evidence suggests that abundant and diverse communities of reef fish, coral and other benthos can develop on these structures, with important ecological implications in urbanized coastal areas in the Gulf. However, due to a variety of unintended consequences of artificial reef development such structures may also pose challenges to coastal marine management. We review the current published literature on artificial reefs in the Gulf in order to improve our understanding of the role that these structures play in Gulf coastal ecosystems, and to further develop regional management of artificial reefs. We explore the various types of artificial reef that exist in the Gulf and examine the benefits and challenges that these structures represent for coastal ecology and economics.

Microbial source tracking (MST) using source-specific molecular markers, genomic community analyses, and physical modeling was used to identify contamination sources along three Lake Michigan beaches of the Laurentian Great Lakes with historically high fecal indicator bacteria (FIB, E. coli ) concentrations. Genetic markers for human (Bacteroides HF183) and mixed gull species ( Catellicoccus marimammalium ) fecal sources were tested from water and sediment. Gene sequencing (16S rRNA) was used to identify similarities in bacterial communities in nearshore water , river inputs, sand, sediment, and groundwater. Synoptic surveys of water exchange were conducted to determine nearshore-offshore interactions of FIB. In addition to these MST studies, best management practices to mitigate FIB, including gull deterrence, slope grading, wetland establishment, and shoreline plantings, were reviewed for their effectiveness at reducing FIB concentrations over time. Using multiple tools for MST helped identify primary and secondary sources of FIB (gulls, stormwater inputs) and the physical processes that exacerbate FIB concentrations (onshore currents, limited circulation). Management actions were successful in the short-term at reducing FIB, but scope of success was temporally limited, with FIB concentrations often rebounding. Results highlight the usefulness of MST to inform best management practices and the need for a sustained adaptive approach that adjusts for changes in the coastal system. ]\n","550\n","iteracion 551\n","[ Marine debris in Malaysia: A review on the pollution intensity and mitigating measures ]\n","551\n","[ Highlights Studies on marine debris in Malaysia are gaining attention over the past two years due to change of policy by the government.

Marine debris was also recorded in isolated and non-habitable islands in Malaysia. , The launch of Roadmap towards Zero Single-use Plastics in 2018 demands baseline data on the management of marine debris in Malaysia. In 2021, Malaysia is placed 28th top plastic polluter in the world with plastic consumption at 56 kg/capita/year, therefore data on mismanaged plastic is imperative.

During glacial period deep-cut landscape prevailed in the plain due to sea level lowering and concomitant headward incision. Sea level rise after LGM raised Yangtze water level which filled up the incised valleys and depressions to form lakes. Influence of sea level change on land surface at orbital timescales could be felt &gt;1400 km upstream from the coast. , The Yangtze Plain (floodplains in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River) is a region with numerous lakes, including the three largest freshwater lakes in China, i.e. Poyang Lake (PYL), Dongting Lake (DTL), and Taihu Lake (THL). The formation mechanism of these lakes offers insights into the ongoing debate concerning the interaction between tectonic activity, climate, sea-level, human impact , and Earth-surface processes. Previous studies have usually focused on individual lakes, so there remains no over-arching and consistent framework for lake formation in the region as a whole. Here we review published sedimentary and chronological records on the above three lakes and propose that sea-level change has determined their formation. During the last glacial maximum (LGM; ca 30–20 ka), with a sea-level &gt;120 m lower than present, a landscape of incised valleys and interfluves prevailed over the entire Yangtze Plain, including the DTL area, which is &gt;1400 km upstream from the modern river mouth, and there was no large lake on the plain. The lakes emerged in the Holocene , although more precise ages await further investigations. The glacial sea-level lowstand , with concomitant headward incision, was responsible for the extensive deeply incised landscape of the LGM, whereas the Holocene high sea-level, with resultant infilling of the incised valleys, accounted for the formation of lakes. This sea-level forcing hypothesis suggests a more far-reaching influence of sea-level change on the Yangtze Plain, and a closer relationship between Earth-surface processes and glacial–interglacial cycles (global climate) than is commonly believed. According to our newly hypothesized climate-controlled geomorphological (CCG) model, it is very likely that similar lake-forming processes could have occurred multiple times during earlier glacial–interglacial cycles, and that this pattern might also have occurred in many other river systems in the eastern coastal areas of China, as well as in other similar river plains worldwide, thus having an important role in shaping modern coastal-plain landscapes. Further work is required to test this CCG model. ]\n","553\n","iteracion 554\n","[ Global PBDE contamination in cetaceans.

This review also emphasizes the anthropogenic and environmental factors that could increase concentrations and associated risks for these species in the next future. High PBDE concentrations above the toxicity threshold and stationary trends have been related to continuous import of PBDE-containing products in cetaceans of Brazil and Australia, where PBDEs have never been produced. Non-decreasing levels documented in cetaceans from the Northwest Pacific Ocean might be linked to the increased e-waste import and ongoing production and use of deca-BDE that is still allowed in China. Moreover, high levels of PBDEs in some endangered species such as beluga whales ( Delphinapterus leucas ) in St. Lawrence Estuary and Southern Resident killer whales ( Orcinus Orca ) are influenced by the discharge of contaminated waters deriving from wastewater treatment plants . Climate change related processes such as enhanced long-range transport, re-emissions from secondary sources and shifts in migration habits could lead to greater exposure and accumulation of PBDEs in cetaceans, above all in those species living in the Arctic. In addition, increased rainfall could carry greater amount of contaminants to the marine environment, thereby, enhancing the exposure and accumulation especially for coastal species. Synergic effects of all these factors and ongoing emissions of PBDEs, expected to continue at least until 2050, could increase the degree of exposure and menace for cetacean populations. In this regard, it is necessary to improve current regulations on PBDEs and broader the knowledge about their toxicological effects, in order to assess health risks and support regulatory protection for cetacean species. ]\n","554\n","iteracion 555\n","[ Storm-induced marine flooding: Lessons from a multidisciplinary approach ]\n","555\n","[ There is a growing interest for marine flooding related to recent catastrophic events and their unintended consequences in terms of casualties and damages, and to the increasing population and issues along the coasts in a context of changing climate.

Three main components are presented in the review: (1) a state-of-the-art on marine submersions from the viewpoint of several scientific disciplines; (2) a selection of examples demonstrating the added value of interdisciplinary approaches to improve our knowledge of marine submersions; (3) a selection of examples showing how the management of future crises or the planning efforts to adapt to marine submersions can be supported by new results or techniques from the research community. From a disciplinary perspective, recent progress was achieved with respect to physical processes, numerical modeling, the knowledge of past marine floods and vulnerability assessment. At a global scale, the most vulnerable coastal areas to marine flooding with high population density are deltas and estuaries . Recent and well-documented floods allow analyzing the vulnerability parameters of different coastal zones. While storm surges can nowadays be reproduced accurately, the modeling of coastal flooding is more challenging, particularly when barrier breaches and wave overtopping have to be accounted for. The chronology of past marine floods can be reconstructed combining historical archives and sediment records. Sediment records of past marine floods localized in back barrier depressions are more adequate to reconstruct past flooding chronology. For the two last centuries, quantitative and descriptive historical data can be used to characterize past marine floods. Beyond providing a chronology of events, sediment records combined with geochronology , statistical analysis and climatology , can be used to reconstruct millennial-scale climate variability and enable a better understanding of the possible regional and local long-term trends in storm activity. Sediment records can also reveal forgotten flooding of exceptional intensity, much more intense than those of the last few decades. Sedimentological and historical archives, combined with high-resolution topographic data or numerical hindcast of storms can provide quantitative information and explanations for marine flooding processes. From these approaches, extreme past sea levels height can be determined and are very useful to complete time series provided by the instrumental measurements on shorter time scales. In particular, historical data can improve the determination of the return periods associated with extreme water levels, which are often inaccurate when computed based on instrumental data, due to the presence of gaps and too short time-series. Long-term numerical hindcast of tides and surges can also be used to provide the required time series for statistical analysis. Worst-case scenarios, used to define coastal management plans and strategies, can be obtained from realistic atmospheric settings with different tidal ranges and by shifting the trajectory of storms. Management of future crises and planning efforts to adapt to marine submersions are optimized by predictions of water levels from hydrodynamic models. Such predictions combined with in situ measurements and analysis of human stakes can be used to define a vulnerability index. Then, the efficiency of adaptation measures can be evaluated with respect to the number of lives that could be potentially saved. Numerical experiments also showed that the realignment of coastal defenses could result in water level reduction up to 1 m in the case where large marshes are flooded. Such managed realignment of coastal defenses may constitute a promising adaptation to storm-induced flooding and future sea level rise . From a legal perspective, only a few texts pay specific attention to the risk of marine flooding whether nationally or globally. Recent catastrophic events and their unintended consequences in terms of death and damages have triggered political decisions, like in USA after hurricane Katrina, and in France after catastrophic floods that occurred in 2010. ]\n","555\n","iteracion 556\n","[ Societal use of fresh submarine groundwater discharge: An overlooked water resource ]\n","556\n","[ Terrestrial groundwater discharging directly into the sea (“fresh submarine groundwater discharge”, fresh SGD) is increasingly recognized as nutrient and pollutant pathway from land to coastal oceans.

A brief review of two 'equilibrium profile' models (i.e., the Bruun and RDA models) is provided as a conceptual foundation before considering a range of complicating factors that are important to determining how sandy coasts may evolve in the future under rates of relative water level rise (RWLR) similar to recent increases in sea level. Key processes controlling beach-dune interaction are reviewed, especially the rates of morphodynamic action relative to the inundation potential driven by water level increases, leading to the conclusion that transgression distances due to RWLR are small in comparison to characteristic shoreline excursions driven by storm events and subsequent reconstruction phases. Much of the available evidence suggests that the beach and foredune (together with the nearshore profile) will migrate landward intact, keeping pace with relatively slow rates of RWLR similar in magnitude to those predicted by current sea-level scenarios. However, the documented response of shorelines in the Great Lakes to several episodes of relatively rapid rates of RWLR over a period of about a decade indicates that landward migration of the foredune through aeolian processes may be too slow to keep pace with this magnitude of shoreline transgression, and therefore the foredune will be over-run by the translating beach and nearshore profile. ]\n","559\n","iteracion 560\n","[ Scientific considerations for acidification monitoring in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Region ]\n","560\n","[ Coastal and ocean acidification has the potential to cause significant environmental and societal impacts.

A lack of monitoring data can lead to a limited understanding of real-world conditions. Without such data, robust experimental and model design is challenging, and the identification and understanding of episodic acidification events is nearly impossible. We present considerations for resource managers, academia, and industry professionals who are currently developing acidification monitoring programs in the Mid-Atlantic region. We highlight the following considerations for deliberation: 1) leverage existing infrastructure to include multiple carbonate chemistry parameters as well as other water quality measurements, 2) direct monitoring efforts in subsurface waters rather than limiting monitoring to surface waters, 3) identify the best available sensor technology for long-term, in-situ monitoring, 4) monitor across a salinity gradient to account for the complexity of estuarine, coastal, and ocean environments, and identify potential areas of enhanced vulnerability, 5) increase sampling frequency to capture variability, 6) consider other drivers (e.g., freshwater discharge, nutrients, physiochemical parameters) that may affect acidification, and 7) conduct or continue monitoring in specific ecological and general regions that may have enhanced vulnerability. Through the incorporation of these considerations, individual monitoring programs can more efficiently and effectively leverage resources and build partnerships for a more comprehensive data collection in the region. While these considerations focus on the Mid-Atlantic region), similar strategies can be used to leverage resources in other locations. ]\n","560\n","iteracion 561\n","[ Incorporating tides and internal gravity waves within global ocean general circulation models: A review ]\n","561\n","[ Highlights We review global ocean models with simultaneous tidal and atmospheric forcing.

A critical appraisal on definitions, methodology and communication ]\n","564\n","[ Mangroves , saltmarsh plants and seagrasses grow in coastal areas near the land–ocean interface. Marine scientists normally identify the substratum in which these plants grow as sediments. For half a century, sediments supporting emergent vegetation have been described by pedologists and some ecologists as soils. However, more recently, some pedologists began to suggest that subtidal marine substrata should be “subaqueous soils.” This followed a change in the definition of soil in the 2 nd (1999) edition of Soil Taxonomy by the US Department of Agriculture. These developments have caused concerns among many coastal marine scientists, and have led to the emergence of serious and important questions which we address in this paper. We conclude that the terms “ sediment ” and “ soil ” to describe the substrata in coastal environments vegetated by mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass beds are not mutually exclusive. Coastal marine substrata will still be denoted sediments by most marine scientists. Pedologists should recognize and affirm the appropriateness of this historical convention, while they at the same time for specific purposes can use the term “soil” when justifiable according to the definition. Furthermore, research methodology must be appropriate to the environments under study and recognize the uniqueness of these water saturated and largely anoxic environments. This is critical to avoid flawed and incomparable results and to facilitate better communication among scientists working in the coastal zone. A mutual awareness and appreciation among involved communities will help to avoid confusion and improve the understanding among the marine and soil researchers studying these systems. We hope that these ideas can be adopted by the marine and terrestrial scientific communities and look forward to further cooperation through a continued positive dialogue. ]\n","564\n","iteracion 565\n","[ Strategies to improve sustainability and offset the initial high capital expenditure of wave energy converters (WECs) ]\n","565\n","[ Wave energy is a nascent industry characterized by high capital costs, which impede technological development and industry expansion. For this reason, new strategies are required to improve sustainability, reduce cost and enable wave energy harnessing even in low energy seas. Six new strategies that can make commercialization of wave energy more appealing are studied. These comprise the integration of wave energy converters (WECs) in coastal defence; tourism; desalination technology ; offshore aquaculture; energy security; and power plants. WECs can axe erosion by half, or even more, in sandy beaches by creating wave shadows in their lee. Therefore, an innovative way to offset WEC high initial capital expenditure is their incorporation in coastal defence, with the added benefit of electricity production. Also, WECs can directly provide pressurized seawater for reverse osmosis desalination plants , thus achieving significant energy, cost and environmental footprint reductions. The touristic trade could also benefit from educational and interpretive displays of the wave energy technology, whilst ecotourism opportunities may arise that could address tourism seasonality. Combined offshore aquaculture facilities with WECs would benefit for reduced installation, operation, and maintenance costs, as well as addressing fossil fuel dependence in aquaculture. Moreover, WECs could be used for mitigating the intermittency of established renewables (solar and wind) and advance their penetration; while a combined WEC- pump hydropower storage scheme could secure the energy supply in remote coastal areas and islands. Finally, WECs could directly supply cooling water intake structures , such as power plants, with the huge amounts of seawater they require for cooling purposes. WEC are also able to provide high purity sterile water for core cooling in nuclear reactors and also support its circulation. For example, WECs can be introduced in coastal nuclear power plants , as to minimize the loss of coolant accident and prevent disasters similar to Fukushima’s 2011. ]\n","565\n","iteracion 566\n","[ Potential of Earth Observation (EO) technologies for seagrass ecosystem service assessments ]\n","566\n","[ Seagrasses are rapidly losing their ability to serve ecosystem services (ESs) with the loss of global biodiversity and coastal habitat degradation over the past few decades. Monitoring ESs is therefore important for tracking subsequent decline or recovery. The development of new Earth Observation (EO) technologies and approaches involved in observing and analyzing data collected from remote sensing (RS) satellite/aircraft would make for a useful application: monitoring and mapping spatial distribution of ESs that seagrasses provide to marine ecosystems and human well-being. Unfortunately, current approaches greatly rely on spatial proxy measures to map distribution of ESs. Many of biophysical parameters are currently detectable by EO instruments, with relevance to ESs. This paper review the capabilities of advanced RS techniques for informing species diversity, growth traits, health condition, ecological processes, and water quality variables linking ESs and describe how these EO products can contribute to ES assessments. Incorporation of both the direct (seagrass extent) and indirect (water related ESs) estimates derived from EO data can now provide more direct estimates of seagrass ecosystem properties (seagrass habitat quality and biodiversity) influencing ESs than the spatial proxies presently in use and they can support in developing more mechanistic models in GIS framework and spatially explicit maps of ESs. The increasing range of EO system and data sets suitable for measuring ES indicators has potential to supporting integrated coastal land use planning. Because each ES indicator and service responds to the environment, there is no ‘one approach fits all’ solution. Selecting EO products, with required resolution to be analyzed will guide to improving mapping efforts. This work also shed lights to sensitize discussion about need of holistic methodologies, challenges, and to motivate an enhanced use of EO-based technology and data. The need for a multidisciplinary project team of ecologists, sociologists, biologists and RS experts has been suggested for proper identification of ES indicators and advanced analysis of EO data. By doing so, we anticipate rapid progress in satellite based ES assessment and characterization of ESs and, in turn, supporting conservation and management of coastal ecosystem. ]\n","566\n","iteracion 567\n","[ Climate change, slow onset events and human mobility: reviewing the evidence ]\n","567\n","[ Highlights Reviews the anatomy of knowledge on slow onset events and their relationships to slow onset climatic processes and events.

In the last 20 years, research by tsunami geologists in northeast Japan has focused on extending the record of tsunamis beyond the range of historical documents in the region, which span too little time to reveal much of the earthquake history over the last millennia. Along the coast of Hokkaido, recurrent sandy deposits are evidence of historical and prehistoric large tsunamis. At Kiritappu marsh, for example, at least 15 identified tsunami deposits occurred between 200 and 6,000 years ago. The spatial distribution of the most recent prehistoric tsunami deposit, that of the so-called 17th-century earthquake and tsunami, exceeds historical and recent tsunami inundations in eastern Hokkaido. Numerical simulations of this event require a multi-segment fault model with variable slip (Mw &gt; 8.8) encompassing both the Tokachi-oki and Nemuro-oki regions to reproduce the observed deposit distribution in eastern Hokkaido. The recurrence interval of such multi-segment earthquakes along the southern Kuril Trench is estimated to be 100–800 years based on tephrochronological and radiocarbon evidence. Tsunami deposits are also associated with historical earthquakes in 1843 and 1894 in eastern Hokkaido and with the 1640 Komagatake eruption in western Hokkaido. The 17th-century earthquake probably triggered postseismic coastal deformation. Diatom-based transfer functions suggest rapid subsidence before the event and gradual uplift afterward, and historical volcanic ash layers indicate that gradual postseismic uplift occurred over decades. A simple dislocation model can explain such gradual uplift as an aseismic fault extension after the 17th-century event. In the Tohoku region, a tsunami deposit associated with the 869 Jogan earthquake has been identified, and the inundation area of this event has been constrained based on the lateral extent of the tsunami deposit and its stratigraphic position beneath the historical To-a tephra (915 CE). Land-level changes at Odaka, Fukushima prefecture, associated with the Jogan event have been estimated based on changes of fossil diatom assemblages below and above the tsunami deposit. Numerical simulations based on geological evidence and observations of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami deposit suggest that the Jogan event was a plate-boundary rupture at least 200 km long along the Japan Trench (Mw &gt; 8.3–8.6). The 1454 Kyotoku tsunami is also considered to have been generated by a rupture area including the Miyagi-oki region (part of the Jogan rupture). It remains unclear whether the 869, 1454, and 2011 tsunamis were similar in size and source; if they were, the recurrence intervals of such events near Sendai are less than 600 years and more regular than those for multi-segment earthquakes along the Kuril Trench. ]\n","568\n","iteracion 569\n","[ Chapter 5 Uranium- and Thorium-Series Nuclides as Tracers of Submarine Groundwater Discharge ]\n","569\n","[ Publisher A number of U- and Th-series isotopes have become popular tools for quantifying submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). These isotopic techniques enable large-scale estimates of various components of SGD, allowing detailed studies on the processes involved. Radium isotopes have proven to be useful tracers of total SGD in many environments on both small- and large scales. The existence of four naturally occurring radium isotopes makes Ra particularly useful for quantifying multiple sources of SGD. The utility of 222 Rn as a tracer of SGD has been demonstrated in a wide range of environments from coastal embayments to the coastal ocean. The approach for quantifying SGD using 222 Rn is similar to radium ( 226 Ra), except for a few key differences. The 222 Rn signature of SGD is best observed near the source because of its short half-life. In contrast, 226 Ra has the ability to integrate the SGD signal over much wider spatial scales. Finally, of the intercomparison studies conducted till date, there appears to be no systematic difference in the two techniques based on the coastal hydrogeologic setting, though a wider range of estimates has been typically observed in areas with fractured crystalline rock aquifers and where springs have been a major conduit for SGD. More recently, the geochemical budget for uranium has been shown to be impacted by SGD. As uranium is enriched in seawater relative to most coastal groundwater, the observed depletion of uranium in estuarine and coastal waters may provide an estimate of the seawater component of SGD that recharges coastal aquifers , or submarine groundwater recharge (SGR). Additionally, new isotope techniques for in situ study are under development including underwater g-spectrometry and continuous radon monitoring. These techniques may be more useful for location of SGD discharges rather than estimation of their magnitudes. ]\n","569\n","iteracion 570\n","[ Challenges and perspectives for the Brazilian semi-arid coast under global environmental changes ]\n","570\n","[ Highlights Changes in the Brazilian semi-arid coast reveal key questions to advance research.

The compiled database includes nearly 4000 O 2 uptake data and is available as supplementary material. It includes also information on bottom water O 2 concentration, O 2 penetration depth, geographic position, water depth, and full information on the data sources. We present the different in situ and ex situ approaches to measure the total oxygen uptake (TOU) and the diffusive oxygen uptake (DOU) of sediments and discuss their robustness towards methodological errors and statistical uncertainty. We discuss O 2 transport through the benthic and diffusive boundary layers, the diffusion- and fauna-mediated O 2 uptake, and the coupling of aerobic respiration to anaerobic processes . Five regional examples are presented to illustrate the diversity of the seabed: Eutrophic seas, oxygen minimum zones, abyssal plains , mid-oceanic gyres , and hadal trenches. A multiple correlation analysis shows that seabed O 2 uptake is primarily controlled by ocean depth and sea surface primary productivity. The O 2 penetration depth scales with the DOU according to a power law that breaks down under the abyssal ocean gyres. The developed multiple correlation model was used to draw a global map of seabed O 2 uptake rates. Respiratory coefficients, differentiated for depth regions of the ocean, were used to convert the global O 2 uptake to organic carbon oxidation. The resulting global budget shows an oxidation of 212 Tmol C yr −1 in marine sediments with a 5-95% confidence interval of 175-260 Tmol C yr −1 . A comparison with the global flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) from photic surface waters to the deep sea, determined from multiple sediment trap studies, suggests a deficit in the sedimentation flux at 2000 m water depth of about 70% relative to the carbon turnover in the underlying seabed.

Here, we review experimental studies on the transport of natural boulders (and artificial bodies) by tsunamis, which provide crucial insights into the physical parameters controlling the transport process. We summarize and categorize the differences and scopes of existing experimental studies and point out the importance of the boulders' wave-facing area and, thus, the drag force, which is highlighted in most studies. The boulder-transport mode (e.g., rolling or sliding), however, varies strongly throughout the publications. A considerable number of influencing parameters is not investigated systematically (e.g., the influence of boulder-boulder interactions) so far, and there is an agreement that existing hydrodynamic equations for mobilization thresholds tend to overestimate the necessary wave height and velocity due to the existing uncertainties. Therefore, and based on the current knowledge, working with parameter ranges (e.g., mobilization thresholds, transport-distance spans) is recommended instead of using exact values. However, we demonstrate that comparisons of the particular findings of the reviewed studies is not straightforward due to very individual experimental setups.

In South Asia, the coastal population depends on the lower part of the river basin for their livelihood such as agriculture and aquaculture . There have been numerous occasions where downstream areas have suffered as a consequence of ad hoc agricultural development activities upstream. Problems encountered in the downstream coastal areas include river desiccation, groundwater depletion, water pollution and sedimentation, salinization and salt water intrusion, soil erosion and nutrient depletion, and dynamic changes in the coastal wetland systems. The objective of this paper is to evaluate current agricultural practices, existing problems, and their implications downstream. This would facilitate the adoption of the river basin approach in managing water resources focusing on the South Asian region. ]\n","576\n","iteracion 577\n","[ Fouling organisms in marine litter (rafting on abiogenic substrates): A global review of literature ]\n","577\n","[ Highlights Few studies have been carried out in the Southern Atlantic. Extreme events such as tsunamis provide opportunities to evaluate biological rafting. Plastic debris is one of the most cited substrates for rafting. The main fouling organisms were Serpulidae, Bryozoans, Balanidae, and Ostreidae. Future studies should consider standardizing various methodological approaches. , One of the underestimated consequences of marine litter presence on marine environment is the transportation of fouling species on detritus – a process known as rafting. We undertook a review of articles concerning rafting published between 1970 and 2020 to identify patterns and potential areas of study that could contribute to directing future research. We observed in 53 publications an increase in rafting studies from the 1990s but fewer studies have been undertaken in the Southern Atlantic. The main fouling organisms were algae, barnacles, bryozoans , mollusks and polychaetes. The transport of those organisms over time and distances, and the volumes of material transported, have been very irregular, reflecting oceanic movements and detritus generating events acting at local, regional, or trans-oceanic scales. No standardized methodologies for collecting marine litter and identifying and quantifying their fouling were observed, but are suggested in this review, to allow more accurate future comparisons among different studies. ]\n","577\n","iteracion 578\n","[ Ecological impacts of ballast water loading and discharge: insight into the toxicity and accumulation of disinfection by-products ]\n","578\n","[ Since the implementation of the International Maritime Organization 2004 regulation, most ships have been equipped with on-dock ballast water treatment.

Fisheries of this diadromous catfish have largely collapsed in the southwest Atlantic coastal region due to overexploitation . An understanding of population structure is now critically needed for improved management strategies for this endangered species . PERMANOVA based on otolith edge chemistry showed significant differences ( p &lt; 0.05 ) between all sites, except Itapanhaú River and Paranaguá Bay. Shape, by comparison, found significant differences between all sampling sites, except Guanabara Bay and Paranaguá Bay, and Itapanhaú River and Paranaguá Bay. Discriminant analysis cross-classification success based on chemistry ranged from 33.3 (Paranaguá Bay) to 100% (La Plata Estuary), and 66.7 (Paranaguá Bay) to 100% (La Plata Estuary) for otolith edges (mean = 61.3%) and cores (mean = 78.9%), respectively. For otolith shape, the jackknifed rate (mean = 45.9%) was relatively low for all sites (32.1–44.7%) except La Plata Estuary (67.6%). Although we do not find otolith shape to be particularly useful; otolith microchemistry supports the presence of different management units. The results revealed that on a small geographic scale (~300 km) microchemistry might not be efficient to discriminate between some sampling sites. ]\n","579\n","iteracion 580\n","[ Arctic kelp forests: Diversity, resilience and future ]\n","580\n","[ Highlights Large brown seaweeds are valuable habitats along otherwise barren Arctic coasts. Knowledge on these underwater forests is missing for parts of the Arctic. Global warming may lead to northern expansion of kelp forests in some areas. Other areas may lose kelps due to coastal erosion from melting land and sea ice. Predictions require a mechanistic, regional understanding of multiple stressors. , The Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing places on Earth and it is a sentinel region for understanding the range and magnitude of planetary changes, and their impacts on ecosystems. However, our understanding of arctic coastal ecosystems remains limited, and the impacts of ongoing and future climate change on them are largely unexplored. Kelp forests are the dominant habitat along many rocky Arctic coastlines, providing structure and food for economically and ecologically important species. Here we synthesize existing information on the distribution and diversity of arctic kelp forests and assess how ongoing changes in environmental conditions could impact the extent, productivity, and resilience of these important ecosystems. We identify regions where the range and growth of arctic kelp are likely to undergo rapid short-term increase due to reduced sea ice cover, increased light, and warming. However, we also describe areas where kelps could be negatively impacted by rising freshwater input and coastal erosion due to receding sea ice and melting permafrost. In some regions, arctic kelp forests have undergone sudden regime shifts due to altered ecological interactions or changing environmental conditions. Key knowledge gaps for arctic kelp forests include measures of extent and diversity of kelp communities (especially northern Canada and northeastern Russia), the faunal communities supported by many of these habitats, and the role of arctic kelp forests in structuring nearby pelagic and benthic food webs. Filling in these gaps and strategically prioritizing research in areas of rapid environmental change will enable more effective management of these important habitats, and better predictions of future changes in the coastal ecosystems they support and the services that they provide. ]\n","580\n","iteracion 581\n","[ Optimization modelling for seawater intrusion management ]\n","581\n","[ Highlights Various optimization techniques were analyzed for managing seawater intrusion.

This problem is the results of indiscriminate and unplanned groundwater exploitation for fulfilling the growing need of freshwater for the burgeoning global population. There is a need to develop appropriate management models for assessing the maximum feasible pumping rates which protects seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers.

Blue carbon emissions occur from mangrove deforestation due to shrimp cultivation. The blue economy of aquaculture has a potential for increasing seafood production. , The rapid development of aquaculture has been considered the blue revolution, which is an approach to increasing global fish production in order to contribute to human nutrition and food security. The use of blue water (i.e., surface and groundwater) in aquaculture also makes a significant contribution to global fish production. However, the blue revolution of aquaculture is associated with a wide range of environmental concerns, including habitat destruction, water pollution, eutrophication , biotic depletion, ecological effects, and disease outbreaks. In addition, blue carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions from mangrove deforestation due to shrimp cultivation are accumulating. To increase fish production for a growing global population, aquaculture must grow sustainably while at the same time its environmental impacts must reduce significantly. There is blue growth potential for increasing seafood production through the expansion of coastal and marine aquaculture, which is essential for sustainable development of the blue economy. ]\n","584\n","iteracion 585\n","[ Ten years after the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake and tsunami: Geological and environmental effects and implications for disaster policy changes ]\n","585\n","[ Although the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake and tsunami were devastating to coastal environments, many of their effects have not lasted: over several years they have generally recovered naturally and artificially. Some environments have not fully recovered or have become stable with some different status. By contrast to the short-lasting tsunami impact, long-lasting crustal movement and reconstruction projects, together with the nuclear power plant accident in the area have strongly affected human society and local coastal environments in a long-term. Investigation reveals that damage outlooks adopted before the 2011 event differed at the prefectural level based on limited knowledge and awareness of the prior 400 years (mainly 120 years). Knowledge, awareness, and reconstruction work undertaken after the 1896, 1933, and 1960 tsunamis were effective to a certain degree during the 2011 tsunami, especially in northern Tohoku. However, past memories of large tsunami disasters in southern Tohoku such as the 869 and 1611 events were lost to the public to a degree that tsunami awareness and countermeasures were insufficient. Although post-2011 governmental policy has been designed to prepare for maximum possible earthquake and tsunami occurrence in the future, no consensus exists of how to forecast such events. Remarkable post-seismic crustal movement has continued. Seismologic and paleotsunami studies have projected a high risk of future large earthquakes and tsunamis surrounding the 2011 source region along the Japan Trench. Considering that low-frequency but large tsunamis have caused extraordinarily intensive and extensive damage, studies based on geology, archaeology, and history are invaluable for elucidating tsunami phenomena and forming accurate risk assessments. In fact, although many historical and geological studies have been conducted along the many coasts of Japan after the 2011 event, no evidence has been provided about extremely large tsunami waves , which greatly exceeded the knowledge available before 2011. Ten years is an extremely short period on a geologic timescale, but it is sufficiently long for the general public to lose their disaster memories gradually. How can we continuously remind public people about such low-frequency tsunami events? How can we foster a social consensus to prepare for them? These issues, which were crucially important before the 2011 event, remain unsolved today. ]\n","585\n","iteracion 586\n","[ Three-dimensional evolution of the Yangtze River mouth, China during the Holocene: impacts of sea level, climate and human activity ]\n","586\n","[ The Yangtze (Changjiang) mega-delta, China, has a high risk of coastal erosion owing to the recent high rate of relative sea-level rise and reduced sediment supply. The study of the Holocene evolution of the delta can provide information about its response to rapid sea-level rise and changes in sediment supply caused by climate or human activity, although this has yet to be fully explored because of the lack of integrated studies using age-constrained sedimentary records. Here we document stratigraphic architecture and morphological changes over the last 11,700 years and estimate the amount of sediment trapped in the delta region on a millennial scale using a dataset of 344 sediment cores , 658 radiocarbon and 28 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages (of which we obtained 64 cores, 345 radiocarbon and 28 OSL ages, and the others we sourced from the literature). Using this dataset we present the temporal and spatial morphodynamic evolution of the entire Yangtze River mouth from its early Holocene transgressive estuary to a mid- to late-Holocene regressive delta, making it possible to produce a quantitative and sequential analysis of sediment deposition. A destructive phase of the river mouth region was identified at 10 to 8 cal. kyr BP, including significant coastal erosion of tidal flats and troughs within the estuary and of tidal ridge-and-trough topography offshore; these resulted from the reshaping of the river mouth morphology caused by rapid sea-level rise at that time. As a result, the rate of sediment trapping at the river mouth declined from an average of 224 Mt yr −1 at 11.7–10 cal. kyr BP to 137 Mt yr −1 between 10 and 8 cal. kyr BP. Since delta initiation 8000 years ago, a retreat of the subaqueous delta occurred and the sediment trapping rate declined from 151 Mt yr −1 at 8–6 cal. kyr BP to 99–113 Mt yr −1 between 6 and 2 cal. kyr BP, caused by the reduction in sediment supply linked to summer monsoon weakening ~6000 years ago. In the last 2000 years the sediment trapping rate has increased to 162 Mt yr −1 due to intensified human activity. The present-day level of sedimentation in delta (49 Mt yr −1 in 2003–2011), after the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, is far lower than the ‘natural’ range in the Holocene . We thus infer a potential for system regime shift in terms of coastal erosion and a transition to a new equilibrium in delta morphology in the near future. ]\n","586\n","iteracion 587\n","[ Parasequences: Allostratigraphic misfits in sequence stratigraphy ]\n","587\n","[ Parasequences were introduced as the building blocks of seismic-scale systems tracts in the context of low-resolution seismic stratigraphy . Pitfalls of this concept relate to the definition of parasequence boundaries as lithological discontinuities that mark episodes of abrupt water deepening. With this general meaning, ‘flooding surfaces’ may be facies contacts within transgressive deposits, or may coincide with different types of sequence stratigraphic surfaces (maximum regressive, transgressive ravinement, or maximum flooding). In all cases, flooding surfaces are allostratigraphic contacts restricted to coastal and shallow-water settings, where evidence of abrupt water deepening can be demonstrated. Flooding surfaces may also be absent from the shallow-water systems, where conformable successions accumulate during gradual water deepening. It follows that (1) parasequences have smaller extent than systems tracts, and (2) systems tracts do not always consist of stacked parasequences. These limitations prevent the dependable use of the parasequence concept in sequence stratigraphy . Advances in high-resolution sequence stratigraphy show that the scales of sequences and parasequences are not mutually exclusive; the two types of units define different approaches to the delineation of stratigraphic cycles at high-resolution scales. Sequences that develop at parasequence scales provide a more reliable alternative for correlation, both within and outside of the coastal and shallow-water settings, rendering parasequences obsolete. Every transgression that affords the formation of a flooding surface starts from a maximum regressive surface and ends with a maximum flooding surface observed at the scale of that transgression. These systems tract boundaries are invariably more extensive than any facies contacts that may form during the transgression. Flooding surfaces remain relevant to the description of facies relationships, but their stratigraphic meaning needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The use of sequences and systems tracts in high-resolution studies provides consistency in methodology and nomenclature at all stratigraphic scales, irrespective of geological setting and the types and resolution of the data available. ]\n","587\n","iteracion 588\n","[ Glacial meltwater influences on plankton community structure and the importance of top-down control (of primary production) in a NE Greenland fjord ]\n","588\n","[ Freshwater runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) can be an important driver influencing plankton community structure in Greenland fjords . In the present study, we describe physical, taxonomic and functional differences in the plankton community in Young Sound, a NE Greenland fjord, from the inner fjord close to the GIS towards the coastal region in late summer. The fjord is influenced by runoff from land-terminating glaciers that separated the surface layer from cold underlying waters. The highest chlorophyll a concentration (&lt;2.5 μg l −1 ) was found in the coastal region at 20–50 m depth. The most profound difference in the mesozooplankton community structure along the section was seen in the abundance of the copepods Microcalanus spp., which were present in the coastal region in the upper 100 m, and Pseudocalanus spp., which only occurred in the surface layers and mainly in the inner part of the fjord.

In spite of high phytoplankton instantaneous growth rates at the innermost fjord station, proto-zooplankton was capable of controlling the phytoplankton production.

This paper reviews current understanding of paleovalley systems from the perspective of Quaternary analogs and experimental studies. Paleovalley systems can include distinct mixed bedrock–alluvial, coastal-plain, and cross-shelf segments. Mixed bedrock–alluvial segments are long-lived, cut across bedrock of significantly older age, and have an overall degradational architecture. By contrast, coastal-plain and cross-shelf segments are non-equilibrium responses to high-frequency cycles of relative sea-level change: most coastal-plain and cross-shelf segments form as a geometric response to relative sea-level fall, as river systems cut through coastal-plain and inner shelf clinothems, and extend basinward to track the shoreline . After incision and cross-shelf extension, lateral channel migration and contemporaneous channel-belt deposition creates a valley-scale feature. Coastal-plain and cross-shelf paleovalley widths are set by the number of channel-belt sandbodies deposited during this time. Paleovalley systems play a key role in source-to-sink sediment routing. Early views included the model of incision and complete sediment bypass in response to relative sea-level fall. However, this model does not stand up to empirical, theoretical, or experimental scrutiny. Instead, there is a complex dynamic between incision, deposition, and sediment export from an evolving valley: periods of incision correspond with sediment export minima, whereas periods of lateral migration and channel-belt construction result in increased flux to the river mouth. Sediment export from evolving valleys, and merging of drainages during cross-shelf transit, play key roles in sediment transfer to the shelf-margin and genetically-linked slope to basin-floor systems. Connection between the river mouth and the shelf margin likely occurs for different periods of time depending on gradient of the river and shelf, as well as amplitude of high-frequency sea-level changes. Late Quaternary analogs and experimental studies provide an alternative sequence-stratigraphic interpretation for paleovalley systems. In coastal-plain paleovalleys, basal valley-fill surfaces meet criteria for an unconformity and a classically-defined sequence boundary: however, this surface is mostly everywhere of the same age as overlying fluvial deposits , and does not correspond to a long period of incision and sediment bypass. In cross-shelf paleovalleys, the basal contact between fluvial and deltaic or shoreface deposits is commonly interpreted as a sequence boundary, but is not an unconformity characterized by incision and sediment bypass. Instead, this surface is a facies contact that separates genetically-related fluvial and deltaic strata: the surface that correlates to the basal valley-fill surface within the coastal-plain paleovalley dips below cross-shelf prograding deltaic and/or shoreface strata, which are fed by deposition within the evolving valley itself, and should be the downlap surface. Many issues deserve attention in the future. We have stressed understanding the inherent scales and physical processes that operate during the formation and evolution of paleovalley systems. We also suggest the relative roles of allogenic forcing vs. autogenic dynamics, and the potential significance of high-frequency isostatic adjustments should be topics for future discussion. ]\n","589\n","iteracion 590\n","[ Trends in sea surface temperature and chlorophyll- a in the seven African Large Marine Ecosystems ]\n","590\n","[ Metrics of the spatiotemporal variability of the physical and biological properties of Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) are critical indices of the trends and changes in these coastal systems. Given that the world's oceans, including coastal systems, are undergoing substantial changes as reported by a range of global assessments, the variability of these changes in space and time is important to understand, if the impacts are to be mitigated and adaptation measures required are to be appropriately applied. We have assessed the trends in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) (1982–2019) and chlorophyll- a concentrations (1997–2019) for all seven of the African LMEs. Our analysis revealed that as a whole almost 99% of all the combined area of African LMEs has warmed. We found rates of SST warming of between 0.11 °C/dec (Agulhas LME) and 0.39 °C/dec (Mediterranean Sea LME) on average for entire LMEs, and regions with rates of as high as 0.58 °C/dec in the Canary Current LME. We also found that 1.1% of the area of the LMEs had cooling trends in association with upwelling regions found in four of the seven LMEs. In this study, we have carefully considered the spatial distribution of warming and cooling in the respective LMEs and identified warming ‘hotspots’ and re-catgorized the LMEs sub-regions into ‘slow’, ‘moderate’, ‘fast’ and ‘superfast’ warming areas, as defined in the Transboundary Waters Assessment Project of the IOC-UNECO-UNEP (2016). In terms of chlorophyll- a , we report that concentration estimates are highly heterogeneous in space and time and that robust trends are, however, difficult to extract from available data. Nevertheless, we do report an overall range in chlorophyll- a concentrations of 0.06–10.9 mg/m 3 and the highest median concentrations in the two Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems, that is, the Benguela Current LME and the Canary Current LME (which also contain the regions with the highest estimates of Net Primary Production (NPP) of 7063 and 7070 mg C/m 2 /day, respectively). The lowest concentrations are in the oligotrophic Agulhas Current LME, which also has the lowest estimate of NPP of 342 mg C/m 2 /day. General declines in chlorophyll- a concentrations are observed with statistically significant rates apparent in the Agulhas LME and contrasting areas of local and patchy increases in chlorophyll- a concentrations over time. Decadal trends in NPP are assessed as generally negative in the eastern LMEs and positive in the Western LMEs. The main conclusion from this study is that while the trends themselves are a further iteration of the manifestation of climate change impacts on African LMEs, it is the high degree of heterogeneity in these properties within the LMEs, along the trans-LME distribution in some instances, that must be taken into consideration for assessment of ecosystem impacts and effective management responses. ]\n","590\n","iteracion 591\n","[ Late Oligocene–Miocene transgressions along the equatorial and eastern margins of Brazil ]\n","591\n","[ The seaboard of Brazil is a highly favorable setting for studying episodes of worldwide sea-level rise because of its passive nature. Previous studies of the equatorial coast of Brazil have led to the recognition of extensive Oligo-Miocene and Miocene marine-influenced deposits, but these deposits have been overlooked in other coastal areas of Brazil. The aim of the present study is to show the origin and evolution of late Oligocene and Miocene marine-influenced strata exposed in more than 5000 km of coastal areas along the WNW-trending equatorial and NNE-trending eastern Brazilian continental margins . We review the most relevant data concerning the strata of these ages exposed along the equatorial and eastern margins of Brazil, and combine them with new data. Based on these occurrences, we analyze the history of sea-level fluctuations and show that marine-influenced strata are more widespread in these margins than originally thought. Our main results indicate that a marine influence is not only imprinted in the deposits exposed along the equatorial margin, but it is also widespread in several areas of the eastern margin. For a long geological time interval ranging from the end of the Cretaceous or Paleogene up to the late Oligocene , most of the Brazilian coast remained a non-depositional site exposed to subaerial erosion and lateritic soil development. The combination of sea-level rise and tectonic subsidence promoted sediment accumulation in the onshore portion of several basins. Two transgressive episodes occurred: one in the Oligo-Miocene and another in the early/middle Miocene. The latter gave rise to deposition of the Barreiras Formation. However, during the supposedly middle Miocene eustatic sea-level highstand in coastal Brazil, there was a renewed and extensive phase of non-deposition and subaerial erosion with lateritic soil formation, a process that lasted up to the Late Quaternary. This mismatching of the sedimentary record with other South American and continental areas is discussed herein. As in many other areas of South America and of the world, the regressive–transgressive events recorded along the Brazilian coast most likely responded to a combination of eustatic sea-level fluctuations and local factors such as tectonic activity, intraplate stresses and changes in dynamic topography during the post-rift history of the eastern South American Plate. ]\n","591\n","iteracion 592\n","[ Human empowerment: Opportunities from ocean governance ]\n","592\n","[ Stimulus to reach the millennium goals of poverty abatement and empowerment, including education and employment, for the large part of the population in the coastal zone can be found in the resources and services of oceans and coasts; the required financial means, given political will and right priorities, can be provided through implementation of the related international conventions, in particular UNCLOS with the EEZ, the Common Heritage of Mankind and other provisions, Agenda 21 [1] of UNCED and the WSSD 2002 Ocean Targets; the motivation is the necessity to address over-exploitation, depletion and destruction of resources, habitats and coastal ecosystem services, global changes, as well as economic transformations and social conditions of poverty, employment and unequity.

Through a survey of beach managers of Local Government Areas and a comprehensive search of peer reviewed and grey literature, we assessed the extent of nourishment practices in Australia. The study identified 130 beaches in Australia that were subject to nourishment practices between 2001 and 2011. Compared to projects elsewhere, most Australian projects were small in scale but frequent. Exceptions were nine bypass projects which utilised large volumes of sediment. Most artificial nourishment, replenishment and beach scraping occurred in highly urbanised areas and were most frequently initiated in spring during periods favourable to accretion and outside of the summer season of peak beach use. Projects were generally a response to extreme weather events, and utilised sand from the same coastal compartment as the site of erosion. Management was planned on a regional scale by Local Government Authorities, with little monitoring of efficacy or biological impact. As rising sea levels and growing coastal populations continue to put pressure on beaches a more integrated approach to management is required, that documents the extent of projects in a central repository, and mandates physical and biological monitoring to help ensure the engineering is sustainable and effective at meeting goals. ]\n","593\n","iteracion 594\n","[ Comprehensive evaluation of resource and environmental carrying capacity based on SDGs perspective and Three-dimensional Balance Model ]\n","594\n","[ Highlights A three-dimensional balance model of resource and environment bearing capacity was established.

Results showed that the natural factors of the human settlement environment will greatly affect the resources and the environment carrying capacity. Water and soil resources and the risk of natural disasters have already restricted resources and the environment. A low level of social and economic development will also reduce the improvement of resources and environmental carrying capacity. More than half of the warning levels of resource and environmental carrying capacity in the study area are in a balanced state. Although the comprehensive carrying capacity of resources and environment has declined, it is in good condition. The focus areas are still the karst mountains in Baise and Chongzuo. Coastal areas of the Beibu Gulf should continue to pay attention to the rational use of land resources and the prevention of natural disasters. Human beings can adjust factors such as water and soil resources, ecological environment, economic framework and social foundation to achieve continuous utilization of regional resources and environment and continuous progress of composite systems. ]\n","594\n","iteracion 595\n","[ Land-sea connectivity, ecohydrology and holistic management of the Great Barrier Reef and its catchments: time for a change ]\n","595\n","[ The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is an iconic and highly valued ecosystem in Queensland, Australia that is recognised internationally for its natural and cultural values. The coastal and marine ecosystems of the GBR are interconnected with the adjacent catchment area through hydrological connections. However, many GBR ecosystems are in a poor state, driven by several factors including a highly modified catchment. Land use changes over the last 160 years have led to development of agricultural land uses, modification of the coastal floodplains and loss of freshwater wetlands , and disruption of drainage and hydrological connections. These ecohydrological changes have led to declining water quality in catchment waterways and increases in the loads of pollutants that are delivered to the GBR, which predominantly occurs in wet season rainfall events. The Australian and State governments have recognised the need to address water quality issues for the GBR through management of the catchments, however, the management strategies adopted to date are largely associated with improvement of agricultural management practices and are not likely to be enough to maintain or restore the health of the GBR ecosystems. Future management strategies need to take into the account the need to protect, maintain and restore coastal ecosystems , system functions and land-sea connectivity if the values of the GBR are to be retained in the long term. ]\n","595\n","iteracion 596\n","[ Review on aquatic macrophytes in Lake Manzala, Egypt ]\n","596\n","[ Lake Manzala is considered as an ecosystem of extreme importance to man and biodiversity. This article presents an overview on the different changes of Lake Manzala in terms of plant distribution, diversity, area of vegetation cover, in addition to the benefits and uses offered by such plants. Eleven aquatic macrophyte species dominated by Potamogeton pectinatus , Eichhornia crassipes , Pistia stratiotes , Phragmites australis , Typha domingensis and Echinochloa stagnina , were recorded in the Lake. As a result of climatic changes and human impacts, this Lake faced many environmental problems and intensive pressure that resulted in changing its ecological features, including the decrease in both bare lands (from 52.45 to 45.50%) and water bodies (from 28.19 to 19.32%), as well as the increase in the vegetation cover (from 19.36 to 35.18%) throughout the period from 1992 to 2019. After the beginning of the Egyptian government's development process at the northern and center sectors of the Lake, the inflow of saline water increased, the concentration of chlorophyll “a” decreased from 4.372 mg m −3 in 2015 to 3.725 mg m −3 in 2018, and water quality showed remarkable enhancement. However, the other parts of Lake Manzala were still suffering from the dense vegetation cover that affected its water quality. Aquatic macrophytes are considered as a massive source of raw material for the industrial production of paper pulp, biofuel and natural therapeutics, beside their effective role in their natural habitat and in the remediation of wastewater. Nevertheless, the rapid growth of macrophytes may cause many environmental problems. The data in this article give decision-makers options for achieving sustainability in future development projects related to Lake Manzala, as well as insights in the assessment and management of pollution in this coastal shallow lagoon. ]\n","596\n","iteracion 597\n","[ Sea-level rise impact models and environmental conservation: A review of models and their applications ]\n","597\n","[ Conservation managers and policy makers need tools to identify coastal habitats and human communities that are vulnerable to sea-level rise.

Most thinking and research on mangrove rehabilitation is focused on rural coastlines, though urban areas also urgently need rehabilitation to offset previous mangrove losses due to coastal development. This is especially the case as urbanization continues in the coastal zone across much of the tropics. However, the drivers of urban mangrove rehabilitation may differ from rural locations, related to replacing habitats lost due to development, or utilizing the wave attenuation function of mangroves to improve the coastal defence of urban assets. Urban mangrove rehabilitation also faces several unique challenges that may not apply to rural rehabilitation projects, particularly related to space constraints and the need to utilize novel spaces and habitats that may be less suitable for mangrove establishment. The tropical nation of Singapore is used as a case study to investigate the various drivers of urban mangrove rehabilitation and the current and future status of rehabilitation projects across the nation. Singapore is also used to highlight the potential for novel mangrove rehabilitation solutions along urban coastlines, particularly the role of novel habitats and ecological engineering, and rehabilitation funding through Corporate Social Responsibility .

We propose a set of four minimum attributes to be included in all ES flow assessments. , Understanding and quantifying ES flows is essential for the sustainable management of social-ecological systems, as it directly captures the human-nature interactions within the system and not solely its individual elements. Especially in degrading marine systems, most ES assessments focus solely on either biophysical or socio-economic elements of these social-ecological systems, failing to directly capture the human-nature interactions. This systematic literature review aims to capture the state of the art of ES flow studies to improve the knowledge base on marine ES flows while highlighting knowledge gaps and discussing future research pathways. Within the review we extract information on: i) the ES flow definitions, classification systems, and indicators; ii) the scales of assessment and methods used to assess marine ES flows; and iii) the types of assessment outputs. 82% of the reviewed ES flow assessment methods were spatially explicit. 63% of the studies assess marine ES flows locally.

As Forbes, Parkes, Manson, and Ketch have stressed, exceptional storms play a major role because, among other effects, wave power is a quadratic function of wave height; surges associated with such exceptional storms raise the level of wave attack on the shore; higher water levels enable waves of a given size to shoal and penetrate farther landward; setup, run-up, overtopping, and overwash are enhanced during storms; more energetic near-bed current velocities and shear stresses occur during storms; and the foregoing effects can produce exceptionally high sediment transport rates and rapid profile change. Processes generated by exceptional storms include shoreface sediment mobilization and adjustment of the nearshore profile, beach, dune and cliff erosion, barrier breaching and overwash, and longshore modifications that may affect tidal inlets . Understanding storm-induced processes is not only important in terms of coastal management, but is also fundamental in palaeoenvironmental shoreline reconstructions. ]\n","601\n","iteracion 602\n","[ The southeast Brazilian rifted continental margin is not a single, continuous upwarp: Variations in morphology and denudation patterns along the continental drainage divide ]\n","602\n","[ Rifted continental margins (RCM) are large-scale features of Earth's surface that show substantial morphological variations. Classical escarpment features are the subject of many studies in these settings while other morphologies that characterize this tectonic environment receive less attention. The case of the Brazilian South Atlantic margin, a continental-scale topographically pronounced terrain covering &gt;1000 km of the western South Atlantic rifted margin, is not an exception. Most landscape evolution studies concentrate on the Serra do Mar escarpment system, while other segments with no escarpments have received less attention. Various authors assume the Brazilian elevated continental margin as a well-defined and continuous marginal upwarp instead of a diversified and more complex landscape. Here we debate this issue and explore how the first-order topographic forms and time-space denudation patterns differ along the Brazilian South Atlantic margin. We focus on the continental margin of southeast Brazil (CMSEB) that includes a southern segment featured by a prominent escarpment system and a northern segment where the seaward-facing steep escarpment is absent. We show that, similar to other RCMs, the CMSEB presents a continental drainage divide separating two distinct regions with contrasting denudation patterns, (i) an inland continental interior , characterized by high elevation and relatively low relief with a predominance of apatite fission track (AFT) ages significantly older than South Atlantic rifting event, and (ii) a coastal region characterized by low elevations and high relief with the predominance AFT ages younger than the rifting. However, besides the differential denudation associated with the South Atlantic opening, the margin has experienced substantial post-rift exhumation attributed to rock uplift triggered by the reactivation of inherited basement structures. The morphological differences between CMSEB's southern and northern extensions reflect sectors with contrasting geomorphic evolution supporting the idea that the rifted Brazilian RCM is not a single and continuous tectonic setting . Finally, our findings indicate that tectonic inheritance strongly impacts the denudation pattern, which contributes to the geomorphic diversification along the Brazilian RCM. ]\n","602\n","iteracion 603\n","[ Facies analysis and ichnology of a prograding river-dominated and wave-influenced deltaic deposit: The Nkporo Formation in the Itigidi-Ediba region of the Afikpo Sub-basin, south-eastern Nigeria ]\n","603\n","[ Integration of the sedimentological and ichnological characteristics of the Campanian-Maastrichtian succession of the Nkporo Formation, Afikpo Sub-basin, particularly in the Itigidi-Ediba area reveals a prograding deposit that is considered to record a river-dominated, wave-influenced and tide affected (Rw t ) delta.

After the relative magmatic quiescence at ca. 210–180 Ma, magmatic activities were mainly developed in the interior of SE China with an areal distribution and subsequently concentrated in the present coastal area with an overall linear pattern after ca. 140 Ma except the Lower Yangtze region. The spatiotemporal change requires a unique crust-mantle geodynamic coupling with the evolution of deep crustal hot zones from intracontinental to continent marginal setting. Correspondingly, the magmatic rocks show a compositional change from bimodal distribution in Early and Middle Jurassic to unimodal and weakly bimodal pattern in Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. In general, most of the Late Mesozoic intermediate to felsic magmatic rocks show higher Mg# than typical rifting-related rocks at given SiO 2 , which requires the addition of water and possible mass transfer and mixing of underplated hydrous basaltic magma in the deep crustal hot zones. The occurrence of high-Sr/Y and La/Yb rocks and possibly thickened crust (ca. 40 km) before ca. 140 Ma, combined with the current thin crust thickness (ca. 31-33 km) as revealed by seismic data, indicates a widespread crustal thinning after ca. 140 Ma. The relatively thickened crust before ca. 140 Ma is beneficial for melting of underlying old crust that is composed of dominantly Neoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic components, the formation of porphyritic Cu deposits, the subsequent magmatic differentiation and associated giant W, Sn, Nb, Ta and Li ore deposits. In contrast, the deep crustal hot zones progressively migrated to the present coastal area after ca. 140 Ma, driving the increasing amounts of intermediate rocks and intermediate-felsic volcanic rocks. In general, the diversity and compositional change of Late Mesozoic magmatic rocks and associated ore deposits in SE China may be controlled by the evolution of deep crustal hot zones in different tectonic settings in response to the subduction of Paleo-Pacific Plate. ]\n","604\n","iteracion 605\n","[ Sea level rise impacts on estuarine dynamics: A review ]\n","605\n","[ Highlights Hydrodynamic models are required to assess estuarine responses to sea level rise (SLR). Knowledge gaps exist in linking SLR-induced changes in physical and ecological processes. Most hydrodynamic models do not include geomorphic and hydro-ecologic feedback loops. Conceptual framework of the tiered nature of estuarine responses to SLR is introduced. Emphasis on human/ecological values pose challenge for estuarine management under SLR. , Sea level rise (SLR) poses a hazard to ecosystems and economies in low-lying coastal and estuarine areas. To better understand the potential impacts of SLR in estuaries , a comprehensive review of existing theory, literature, and assessment tools is undertaken. In addition, several conceptual models are introduced to assist in understanding interlinked estuarine processes and their complex responses to SLR. This review indicates that SLR impacts in estuaries should not be assessed via static (bathtub) approaches as they fail to consider important hydrodynamic effects such as tidal wave amplification , dampening, and reflection. Where hydrodynamic models are used, the existing literature provides a relatively detailed understanding of how SLR will affect estuarine hydrodynamics (e.g., tides and inundation regimes). With regards to the current understanding of, and ability to model, the connections between altered hydrodynamics (under SLR) and dependent geomorphic, ecological, and bio-geochemical processes, significant knowledge gaps remain. This is of particular concern as there is currently a paradigm shift towards more integrated and holistic management of estuaries. Estuarine management under accelerating SLR is likely to become increasingly complex, as decision-making will be undertaken with uncertainty. As such, this review highlights that there is a fundamental requirement for more sophisticated and interdisciplinary studies that integrate physical, ecological, bio-geochemical, and geomorphic responses of estuaries to SLR. ]\n","605\n","iteracion 606\n","[ Hurricane signatures and landforms—toward improved interpretations and global storm climate chronology ]\n","606\n","[ The correct understanding of the geological and geomorphic evolution of paralic basins and coastal barriers is a prerequisite for establishing Holocene hurricane archives worldwide. Detection and documentation of hurricane signatures in coastal deposits are becoming instrumental in attempts to reconstruct mid and late Holocene storm climate history. Subsurface exploration and field studies on the NE Gulf coast and data gleaned from the literature suggest the need for a complex approach that provides well-documented details of coastal landscape evolution. Until recently, prehistoric hurricanes and their intensity levels have been automatically interpreted from the frequency and thickness of sand layers in muddy paralic deposits. However, in addition to wind velocity, several hydro-, aerodynamic, and other factors a wide range of stratigraphic conditions, topographic setting, and sand sources also determine variations in the extent and intensity of storm flooding, erosion, transfer, and deposition of sand layers in small paralic basins. Inherent limitations in these sedimentary records and their interpretation must be overcome in order to improve local hurricane chronologies and establish interregional correlations. Before sedimentary and chemical signatures are accepted as diagnostic indicators of overwash especially by “catastrophic” hurricanes, alternative causes must also be considered. A parallel scale of storm flood-level stages should supplement the Saffir–Simpson hurricane categories. The relationship between storm intensities and flooding elevations is highly complex. Changes in sea-level, shore positions, formation and extinction of preexisting incised valley networks, the impact of transgression and regression processes on estuaries and their deposits play determining roles in setting the stage for overwash processes. Strandplain progradation followed by erosive shore retreat played a key role in framing certain paralic lakes. Without overwash, sand layers and marine microfossils may be also emplaced by storm-driven currents that enter unobstructed estuaries, inlets and storm breaches. Bioturbation also distorts the storm record. Significant lateral variations in the number and thickness of intercalated sand layers at closely adjacent sites suggest the importance of local differences in sources, transport and preservation processes; in the dimensions, relative positions and accessibility of sand resources inside and adjacent to coastal basins. Variations in the number, thickness, and ages of sand laminae, may not be related to the number of storms and their intensities. This may impair correlations between regionally interpreted “calm” and “intensive” phases. In partial overlap with an assumed “quiescent” storm phase, stable isotope ratios in lacustrine muds impacted by salt water influx reveal frequent hurricane activity during the last 1.5 ka as well. By mimicking effects of reduced storminess, the fewer and thinner sand laminae deposited between ~ 7.0 and 3.4 ka B.P. may be attributed to greater distances of estuarine landward transport by storm tidal currents at times of lower sea-levels. ]\n","606\n","iteracion 607\n","[ A bibliometric analysis of process safety research in China: Understanding safety research progress as a basis for making China’s chemical industry more sustainable ]\n","607\n","[ Along with the expansion of China’s chemical industry, a series of catastrophic chemical accidents have occurred, often with severe human casualties, resulting in adverse effects on the sustainable development .

Coastal regions are more vulnerable to the negative impact of ocean acidification. , Ocean acidification and pollution coexist to exert combined effects on the functions and services of marine ecosystems. Ocean acidification can increase the biotoxicity of heavy metals by altering their speciation and bioavailability. Marine pollutants, such as heavy metals and oils, could decrease the photosynthesis rate and increase the respiration rate of marine organisms as a result of biotoxicity and eutrophication, facilitating ocean acidification to varying degrees. Here we review the complex interactions between ocean acidification and pollution in the context of linkage of multiple stressors to marine ecosystems. The synthesized information shows that pollution-affected respiration acidifies coastal oceans more than the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Coastal regions are more vulnerable to the negative impact of ocean acidification due to large influxes of pollutants from terrestrial ecosystems.

The objectives of present study are to review the status of aquaculture and IMTA in Korea; and to determine the challenges to apply the principles of IMTA to intensive monoculture in Korean coastal waters. Korea has been one of the leading countries in aquaculture. Like other advanced countries in aquaculture, such as China and Japan, most aquaculture practices in Korea are intensive monoculture and farms are highly concentrated in bays or estuaries with restricted circulation. In intensive open water aquaculture in these waters, nutrient producers (finfish) are cultured mostly in southeastern Korea whereas extractive organisms (seaweeds) are farmed in the southwestern Korea. There are relatively small areas of overlap between these monocultures, causing environmental issues and reduction in the quality of aquacultured products. Recent attempts of IMTA in Korean coastal waters suggest that IMTA can be a good management tool for improving Korean aquaculture although there are still challenges to overcome. These challenges include development of temperature tolerant species/strains of extractive organisms such as seaweeds and sea cucumbers. Most aquacultured seaweed and sea cucumber species in Korea do not grow well during the summer months, when the release of finfish effluent is at its peak. It is essential to the future success of aquaculture in Korea that a coastal zone management (CZM) be developed that reflects coordinating fed and extractive organisms in coastal bays and estuaries rather them keeping them isolated from one another. The importance of a new regulatory framework advocating IMTA solutions will be essential for environmental protection and continued success of aquaculture in Korea. Although this review is a case study in Korea for IMTA, it will also provide critical information for coastal managers, aquaculturists and regulators in other countries where there are intensive monocultures of fed and extractive organisms. ]\n","611\n","iteracion 612\n","[ Carbon transportation, transformation, and sedimentation processes at the land-river-estuary continuum ]\n","612\n","[ In terrestrial ecosystems, carbon (C) transportation and C pool transformation processes both occur at the land-river-estuary continuum.

As a consequence of the geochemical processes involved, a part of the sediment may be deposited in the estuary and the remainder flows into the ocean, being transported and deposited under the influence of tides and maritime currents. This study was carried out in the Cananeia–Iguape estuary on the southern coast of São Paulo state, Brazil. The vertical distribution of 210 Pb and 137 Cs in sediments has been used as a tool for estimating the sedimentation rates in the coastal environment. Concentrations of 210 Pb and 137 Cs, as well as heavy metals (lead, zinc, copper) were determined in four sediment cores collected in the Cananeia–Iguape estuary. The estimated sedimentation rates were from 5.3 mm yr −1 to 12.7 mm yr −1 . The highest sedimentation rate obtained for Valo Grande corresponds with an accelerated expansion of the sand and clay banks of the Mar Pequeno channel, a growth of the mangrove areas, and a decrease in the depth of the main channel of navigation, a fact that has been affecting the navigation in the area very seriously. The data obtained for the metals showed a sedimentary dynamics in agreement with that obtained in the studies of sedimentation rates, thus contributing to the understanding of the hydrodynamic mechanisms of the system. ]\n","615\n","iteracion 616\n","[ Modeling sediment transport in the swash zone: A review ]\n","616\n","[ A critical review of conceptual and mathematical models developed in recent decades on sediment transport in the swash zone is presented. Numerous studies of the hydrodynamics and sediment transport in the swash zone in recent years have pointed out the importance of swash processes in terms of science advancement and practical applications. Evidently, the hydrodynamics of the swash zone are complex and not fully understood. Key hydrodynamic processes include both high-frequency bores and low-frequency infragravity motions, and are affected by wave breaking and turbulence, shear stresses and bottom friction. The prediction of sediment transport that results from these complex and interacting processes is a challenging task. Besides, sediment transport in this oscillatory environment is affected by high-order processes such as the beach groundwater flow. Most relationships between sediment transport and flow characteristics are empirical, based on laboratory experiments and/or field measurements. Analytical solutions incorporating key factors such as sediment characteristics and concentration, waves and coastal aquifer interactions are unavailable. Therefore, numerical models for wave and sediment transport are widely used by coastal engineers. This review covers mechanisms of sediment transport, important forcing factors, governing equations of wave-induced flow, groundwater interactions, empirical and numerical relations of cross-shore and longshore sediment transport in the swash zone. Major advantages and shortcomings of various numerical models and approaches are highlighted and reviewed. These will provide coastal modelers an impetus for further detailed investigations of fluid and sediment transport in the swash zone. ]\n","616\n","iteracion 617\n","[ Review of electromagnetic induction for mapping barrier island framework geology ]\n","617\n","[ The geologic framework controls on modern barrier island transgression and the relationship of these controls to subsurface structure, hydrology and island geomorphology are not well understood. Recent evidence suggests that alongshore variations in pre-Holocene geology of barrier islands modify nearshore hydrodynamic processes and sediment transport , ultimately affecting how barrier islands will respond to relative sea-level rise. Explorations of Holocene barrier island geology are usually based on cores to supplement bathymetric, onshore/offshore seismic and/or ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys. The advantages and limitations of these methods with respect to barrier island investigations are briefly described in this review. Alternative near-surface geophysical methods including electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors are increasingly being used for coastal research because they are non-invasive, provide continuous subsurface information across a variety of sub-environments, and are capable of characterizing large areas in a short time. Although these EMI sensors have shown promise in coastal applications, a number of issues primarily related to subsurface hydrology need to be addressed to fully assess the limitations of this technique. This paper reviews the theory, methodology and applications of EMI in support of geologic framework studies with particular reference to barrier islands. Resolution of these issues will allow EMI sensors to complement and offer significant advantages over traditional methods in support of an improved understanding of large-scale barrier island evolution. ]\n","617\n","iteracion 618\n","[ Oxygen minimum zone copepods in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal: Their adaptations and status ]\n","618\n","[ Highlights Presents the copepods in the OMZs of the Arabian Sea (AS) and the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Summarises the oceanography of a thicker OMZ in the AS than in the BoB. Lucicutia grandis is an indicator of the lower boundary of OMZ in the AS. Calanoides carinatus is a diapausing species of OMZ in the AS. A severe lack of information exists on OMZ copepods in the BoB. , The Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are cul-de-sacs of the northern Indian Ocean, and they contain more than half of the world's Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs). The current study reviews the vast and advancing literature on the oceanographic settings that lead to distinct OMZs in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal and links them with the copepods thriving there, their status, and likely adaptations. The Arabian Sea has a thicker perennial subsurface OMZ (∼1000 m) than the Bay of Bengal (∼500 m), which is linked to high plankton production via upwelling and winter convection in the former and river influx and mesoscale eddies in the latter. Studies world over show that OMZs adversely affect the zooplankton community as their core always sustains reduced zooplankton biomass. Exclusive studies on copepods in the perennial OMZ in the northern Indian Ocean have been limited to the Arabian Sea so far, which showed that the calanoid copepod Lucicutia grandis is an indicator species of the OMZ lower boundary, whereas Calanoides natalis is a diapausing species in the OMZ. Studies also evidenced that many calanoids ( Pleuromamma indica , Lucicutia longicornis , Rhincalanus nasutus , Paracalanus aculeatus , Eucalanus attenuatus , Euchaeta rimana , Subeucalanus subcrassus ), cyclopoids ( Oithona nana , Oncaea conifera , Oncaea subtilis , Saphirina ), Harpacticoids ( Microsetella sp., Aegisthus mucronatus ) and Mormonilloids ( Mormonilla minor ) living in the perennial OMZ are either vertical migrators or having a patchy distribution between the epipelagic to the deeper OMZ stratum. These OMZ copepods are believed to have distinctive growth and reproductive traits that allow them to exist in the OMZs. Their high enzyme activity allows them to carry out vertical migration, their high lipid reserves allow them to stay alive in starving conditions, and their slow lifestyle reduces their energy consumption in deeper OMZs. Unlike the perennial OMZs in the Arabian Sea, copepods in the seasonal OMZs in the coastal upwelling zones are almost unexplored, except for a recent attempt that demonstrated that cyclopoids have better survival strategies there. The Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal around India have a strong seasonal exchange of their water masses, but how they influence and shape the copepod communities in these regions and the OMZs they harbour is completely unknown. ]\n","618\n","iteracion 619\n","[ Mangroves of Vietnam: Historical development, current state of research and future threats ]\n","619\n","[ Vietnamese mangroves are among the most productive and biologically important ecosystems of the world; providing habitat/nursing grounds for commercial and non-commercial fish species, food, medicine, building materials/fuel for local communities, as well as carbon storage (blue carbon) and coastal protection from storm events.

This review article discusses the principal factors which influence mangroves in Vietnam including climate and climate change, hydrology, soil and topography, and anthropogenic factors such as aquaculture expansion, illegal logging, damming, pollution), which requires special attention. We further discuss the important role that Vietnamese mangrove forests play an in the socio-economic development of the country, even though the exploitation and protection of mangrove forests in many provinces are often uncontrolled. We discuss successful management practices including co-management models for mangrove restoration, which have been a success in Vietnam. Conservation and rehabilitation process of mangrove forests by various national and international agencies are still on-going and the success of such activities is influenced by various socio-economic, political as well as environmental factors. Further challenges in effective mangrove management arise due to climate change, which accelerates high atmospheric CO2, increased air temperature, sea level rise , storminess, ocean currents and alterations in precipitation regime. Recent developments in remote sensing applications can be utilized to improve the mapping and monitoring the changes in mangrove ecosystems in Vietnam thereby improving the effective management of mangrove forests. ]\n","619\n","iteracion 620\n","[ Evolutionary versus ecological success in Antarctic benthic invertebrates ]\n","620\n","[ The unusually high proportion of brooding compared with broadcaster species among coastal Antarctic invertebrates has been traditionally interpreted as an adaptation to local environmental conditions.

Therefore, is the apparent ecological success of broadcasters related to their developmental mode? We argue that the present shallow Antarctic benthic invertebrate fauna is the result of two processes acting at different temporal scales. First, the high proportion of brooding species compared with coastal communities elsewhere corresponds to species-level selection occurring over geological and evolutionary times. Second, the ecological dominance of broadcasters is the result of processes operating at ecological timescales that are associated with the advantage of having pelagic larvae under highly disturbed conditions. ]\n","620\n","iteracion 621\n","[ Dilemmas of modelling and decision-making in environmental research ]\n","621\n","[ Highlights Critical analysis of two dilemmas that confound social-ecological modelling.

Along-margin temporal correlations are used to identify past subduction earthquakes. Upper plate faults introduce uncertainty in earthquake source interpretation. We identify ten possible subduction earthquakes in the past 7000 years. , The Hikurangi subduction margin, New Zealand, has not produced large subduction earthquakes within the short written historic period (~180 years) and the potential of the plate interface to host large (M &gt; 7) to great (M &gt; 8) earthquakes and tsunamis is poorly constrained. The geological record of past subduction earthquakes offers a method for assessing the location, frequency and approximate magnitude of subduction earthquakes to underpin seismic and tsunami hazard assessments. We review evidence of Holocene coseismic coastal deformation and tsunamis at 22 locations along the margin. A consistent approach to radiocarbon age modelling is used and earthquake and tsunami evidence is ranked using a systematic assessment of the quality of age control and the certainty that the event in question is an earthquake. To identify possible subduction earthquakes, we use temporal correlation of earthquakes, combined with the type of earthquake evidence, likely primary fault source and the earthquake certainty ranking. We identify 10 past possible subduction earthquakes over the past 7000 years along the Hikurangi margin. The last subduction earthquake occurred at 520–470 years BP in the southern Hikurangi margin and the strongest evidence for a full margin rupture is at 870–815 years BP. There are no apparent persistent rupture patches, suggesting segmentation of the margin is not strong. In the southern margin, the type of geological deformation preserved generally matches that expected due to rupture of the interseismically locked portion of the subduction interface but the southern termination of past subduction ruptures remains unresolved. The pattern of geological deformation on the central margin suggests that the region of the interface that currently hosts slow slip events also undergoes rupture in large earthquakes, demonstrating different modes of slip behaviour occur on the central Hikurangi margin. Evidence for subduction earthquakes on the northern margin has not been identified because deformation signals from upper plate faults dominate the geological record. Large uncertainties remain in regard to evidence of past subduction earthquakes on the Hikurangi margin, with the greatest challenges presented by temporal correlation of earthquake evidence when working within the uncertainties of radiocarbon ages, and the presence of upper plate faults capable of producing deformation and tsunamis similar to that expected for subduction earthquakes. However, areas of priority research such as improving the paleotsunami record and integration of submarine turbidite records should produce significant advances in the future. ]\n","622\n","iteracion 623\n","[ Application of management tools to integrate ecological principles with the design of marine infrastructure ]\n","623\n","[ Highlights Marine structures such as seawalls and offshore energy platforms are increasing.

While protection of natural coastal habitat is recommended, balancing conservation with human services is now the challenge for managers. Marine infrastructure such as seawalls, marinas and offshore platforms is increasingly used to support and provide services, but has primarily been designed for engineering purposes without consideration of the ecological consequences.

As a result, understanding of geomorphic systems is often scale-constrained due to a host of methodological, logistical, and theoretical factors that limit the scope of how Earth scientists study landforms and broader landscapes. This paper reviews recent advances in understanding of the geomorphology of beach-dune systems derived from over a decade of collaborative research from Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. A comprehensive summary of key findings is provided from short-term experiments embedded within a decade-long monitoring program and a multi-decadal reconstruction of coastal landscape change. Specific attention is paid to the challenges of scale integration and the contextual limitations research at specific spatial and/or temporal scales imposes. A conceptual framework is presented that integrates across key scales of investigation in geomorphology and is grounded in classic ideas in Earth surface sciences on the effectiveness of formative events at different scales. The paper uses this framework to organize the review of this body of research in a ‘scale aware’ way and, thereby, identifies many new advances in knowledge on the form and function of subaerial beach-dune systems. Finally, the paper offers a synopsis of how greater understanding of the complexities at different scales can be used to inform the development of predictive models, especially those at a temporal scale of decades to centuries, which are most relevant to coastal management issues. Models at this (landform) scale require an understanding of controls that exist at both ‘landscape’ and ‘plot’ scales. Landscape scale controls such as sea level change , regional climate, and the underlying geologic framework essentially provide bounding conditions for independent variables such as winds, waves, water levels, and littoral sediment supply. Similarly, a holistic understanding of the range of processes, feedbacks, and linkages at the finer plot scale is required to inform and verify the assumptions that underly the physical modelling of beach-dune interaction at the landform scale. ]\n","624\n","iteracion 625\n","[ Pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in the marine environment: Sources, analytical methods and occurrence ]\n","625\n","[ Highlights Estuaries and marine outfalls are major sources of pharmaceuticals in the marine environment.

The Kongling and Kunming-Hainan domains are characterized by isolated Archean to early Paleoproterozoic rock units and events and crop out in northern and southern South China, respectively. The Kunming-Hainan Domain is preserved in three spatially separated regions at Kunming (southwestern South China), along the Ailaoshan shear zone, and within Hainan Island. Both domains were affected by late Paleoproterozoic tectonothermal events, indicating their likely juxtaposition by this time to form the proto-Yangtze Block. Late Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic sedimentary and igneous rock units developed on the proto-Yangtze Block, especially in its southern portions, and help link the rock units that formed along the shear zone at Ailaoshan and on Hainan Island into a single, spatially unified unit prior to Paleozoic to Cenozoic structural disaggregation and translation. The Wuyi Domain consists of late Paleoproterozoic rock units within a NE-SW trending, fault-bounded block in eastern South China. The Coastal Domain lies east of the Wuyi domain and is inferred to constitute a structurally separate block. Basement to the domain is not exposed, but zircon Hf model ages from Mesozoic granites suggest Mesoproterozoic basement at depth. The Archean to Paleoproterozoic tectonothermal record of the Kongling and Kunming-Hainan domains corresponds closely with that of NW Laurentia , suggesting all were linked, probably in association with assembly and subsequent partial fragmentation of the Nuna supercontinent. Furthermore, the age and character of Mesoproterozoic magmatism and detrital zircon signature of sedimentary rocks in the proto-Yangtze Block matches well with western Laurentia and eastern Australia-Antarctica. In particular, the detrital zircon signature of late Paleoproterozoic to early Mesoproterozoic sedimentary units in the block (e.g. Dongchuan Group) share a similar age spectrum with the Wernecke Supergroup of northwest Laurentia. This, together with similarities in the type and age of Fe-Cu mineralization in the domain with that in eastern Australia-Antarctica, especially northeast Australia, suggests a location adjacent to northwest Laurentia, southern Siberia , and northeast Australia within the Nuna supercontinent. The timing and character of late Paleoproterozoic magmatic activity in the Wuyi domain along with age of detrital zircons in associated sedimentary rocks matches the record of northern India. During rifting between Australia–Antarctica and Laurentia in the late Mesoproterozoic, the proto-Yangtze Block remained linked to northeast Australia. During accretionary orogenesis in the early Neoproterozoic, the proto-Yangtze Block assembled with the Wuyi Domain along the northern margin of India. The Coastal domain likely accreted at this time forming the South China Craton. Displacement of the Hainan and Ailaoshan assemblages from southwest of the Kunming assemblage likely occurred in the Cenozoic with the activation of the Ailaoshan-Red River fault system but could have begun in the early to mid-Paleozoic based on evidence for tectonothermal events in the Hainan assemblage. ]\n","626\n","iteracion 627\n","[ Relationship between human factors and a safe performance of vessel traffic service operators: A systematic qualitative-based review in maritime safety ]\n","627\n","[ Highlights Bibliometric analysis focused on the temporal evolution of the keywords “maritime safety” and “VTS” show the importance of these issues nowadays.

Experience and standardization are shown as essential to counteract the negative effects caused in VTSOs by the rest of the factors studied. , The growth of the world merchant fleet in recent decades has caused an increase in congestion and complexity in maritime traffic, especially in coastal areas, straits and nearby channels.

Intensive research has been placed into global and regional wave climate projections over the past 10 years, but no systematic review has been conducted to date. Here, we present a consensus-based analysis of 91 published global and regional scale wind-wave climate projection studies to establish consistent patterns of impacts of global warming on the wind-wave climate across the globe. Furthermore, we critically discuss research efforts, current limitations and identify opportunities within the existing community ensemble of projections to resolve various sources of uncertainty amongst the sparsely sampled set of future scenarios. We find consensus amongst studies regarding an increase of the mean significant wave height H ¯ s H ¯ s across the Southern Ocean , tropical eastern Pacific and Baltic Sea, and conversely, a decrease of H ¯ s H ¯ s over the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, we observe that projections of H ¯ s H ¯ s over the eastern north Pacific and southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans lack consensus. Similarly, future projections of extreme H s lack consensus everywhere, except for the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic. We note a distinct lack of research regarding projected changes in wave direction which is of critical importance particularly for the mitigation of coastal hazards. Furthermore, we observe that the projection uncertainty surrounding wind-wave climate projections has been poorly sampled.

A cradle of ancient civilisations, the Mediterranean has seen its shores occupied by Humans since Prehistory, and is, therefore, a particularly pertinent unit of analysis. The morphotectonic context and other forcing agents (e.g., climate) shaped out a highly diversified coastal morphology and generated a sediment-supply regime potentially favourable to the formation of numerous open-coast deltas and bay-head deltas in infilled rias as sea level stabilised during the mid-Holocene. This supply of riverine sediment has also been the key agent in mediating human occupation of the Mediterranean's clastic coasts. Expressions of this relationship have been extensively archived in clastic coastal deposits, including base-level deltaic and estuarine sedimentary sinks, which comprise records to explore the interactions between geosystems and the human environment. The stratigraphic sequences in these coastal sedimentary archives comprise, in many places, a clearly identified anthropogenic signature, notably in ancient harbours, some of which underwent extremely rapid silting up due to massive sediment sourcing generated by new agricultural practices from the Neolithic onwards. Increasing human influence, especially over the last 3000 years, has been, in turn, an important driver of changes in sediment supply, strongly modulating deltaic development. Pulses of sediment supply from catchments rendered vulnerable by human perturbations during the Roman period resulted in a new cycle of inception of many other deltas and in rapid delta growth (e.g. the Ebro, the Po, the Arno and the Ombrone). Another progradation dynamic during the Little Ice Age , at a time of strong rural population growth, river discharge increases, technological developments, and urbanisation, further consolidated delta growth. Understanding the life cycle of these deltas since their initial formation is, in turn, key to unravelling the relative role of natural and anthropogenic forcing agents. Rapid climate changes are deemed to have contributed through both the stripping of landscapes rendered fragile by human activities and active fluvial sediment transport to the coast, but disentangling climate change effects from human impacts in the Mediterranean remains a challenge. The patterns of subsequent deltaic growth and delta morphodynamics reflect adaptations to pulsed sediment supply, river discharge variations, the microtidal, fetch-limited context of the Mediterranean, and direct engineering interventions. The progradation dynamic of the Roman period and Little Ice Age contrasts markedly with the situation of common coastal destabilisation over the last two centuries, particularly well documented for the last 50 years. This period has been characterised by reduced sediment flux to base-level geosystems due to catchment reforestation, retenion within reservoirs, fluvial regulation and dredging , resulting in the erosion of deltas and barrier–lagoon and beach–dune systems. Large stretches of shoreline and narrow coastal plains have been massively engineered for coastal defence and protection against erosion, but also for the construction of marinas, leisure harbours and artificial beaches, resulting in the emergence of veritable artificial seafronts. These interventions have, collectively and progressively, raised societies to a pervasive and overarching position in the geomorphic stability–instability of the Mediterranean's coasts, a situation that will be exacerbated by pressures from sea-level rise, paving the way for rampant coastal erosion and delta destruction. ]\n","630\n","iteracion 631\n","[ Dissolved organic matter in the Baltic Sea ]\n","631\n","[ Highlights The current knowledge on the sources and losses of DOC in the Baltic Sea Summarizes knowledge on the DOC dynamics from the catchment to the sea Conceptual models for the loss processes of autochthonous and allochthonous DOC Compiles published data on DOM distribution in the Baltic Sea , Several factors highlight the importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in coastal ecosystems such as the Baltic Sea: 1) DOM is the main energy source for heterotrophic bacteria in surface waters, thus contributing to the productivity and trophic state of bodies of water. 2) DOM functions as a nutrient source: in the Baltic Sea, more than one-fourth of the bioavailable nutrients can occur in the dissolved organic form in riverine inputs and in surface water during summer. Thus, DOM also supports primary production, both directly (osmotrophy) and indirectly (via remineralization). 3) Flocculation and subsequent deposition of terrestrial DOM within river estuaries may contribute to production and oxygen consumption in coastal sediments . 4) Chromophoric DOM, which is one of the major absorbers of light entering the Baltic Sea, contributes highly to water color, thus affecting the photosynthetic depth as well as recreational value of the Baltic Sea. Despite its large-scale importance to the Baltic Sea ecosystem, DOM has been of minor interest compared with inorganic nutrient loadings. Information on the concentrations and dynamics of DOM in the Baltic Sea has accumulated since the late 1990s, but it is still sporadic.

To address this management need, we conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed studies, public reports, and gray literature that examined the impacts of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP: phosphate) on scleractinian corals. The systematic review. resulted in 47 studies with comparable data on coral holobiont responses to nutrients: symbiont density, chlorophyll a (chl- a ) concentration, photosynthesis, photosynthetic efficiency, growth, calcification, adult survival, juvenile survival, and fertilization. Mixed-effects meta-regression meta-analyses were used to determine the magnitude of the positive or negative effects of DIN and DIP on coral responses. Zooxanthellae density (DIN &amp; DIP), chl- a concentration (DIN), photosynthetic rate (DIN), and growth (DIP) all exhibited positive responses to nutrient addition; maximum quantum yield (DIP), growth (DIN), larval survival (DIN), and fertilization (DIN) exhibited negative responses. In lieu of developing specific thresholds for the management of nutrients as a stressor on coral reefs, we highlight important inflection points in the magnitude and direction of the effects of inorganic nutrients and identify trends among coral responses. The responses of corals to nutrients are complex, warranting conservative guidelines for elevated nutrient concentrations on coral reefs. ]\n","634\n","iteracion 635\n","[ Assessing the robustness of geochronological records from the Arabian Peninsula: A new synthesis of the last 20 ka ]\n","635\n","[ Highlights A new palaeoenvironmental database of geochronological records from the Arabian Peninsula. Data are assessed based on their robustness and provide a new synthesis for the last 20 ka. Significant spatial and temporal disparities identified in the number and quality of records. Records show greater heterogeneity than can be assumed from palaeoclimatic archives alone. , The timing and extent of Late Quaternary climate and environmental changes in the Arabian Peninsula were critical for human demographic changes. High resolution palaeoclimate archives suggest that monsoon variability was a key driver of change, but these records obscure environmental heterogeneity at finer spatial scales. Recent decades have seen the production of new, chronometrically controlled records from a range of new sites, with a greater spatial coverage. However, records often appear contradictory vis a vis the hydro-climatic state of the environment and so synthesising them can be challenging. To enhance collation and interpretation of records we have compiled a new database of terrestrial and coastal environmental chronologies for the Arabian Peninsula over the last 20 ka, a key period of marked hydrological change . The SCAPE ( S ynthesising C hronologies for A rabian P alaeo E nvironments) database contains records that include &gt;700 luminescence and radiocarbon ages. Robustness criteria are applied to identify the utility of each data source in regional hydroclimate reconstruction. The most robust data provide a unique synthesis of 20 ka of palaeoenvironmental change at sub-regional scales. We find that Arabian environmental change does not necessarily follow broad narratives of ‘wet’ or ‘dry’ states but rather the climatic signal is a mosaic of substantial landscape heterogeneity. SCAPE also highlights regions in which more high-quality geochronological investigation is warranted to refine both temporal and spatial records, signifying important avenues for future research. ]\n","635\n","iteracion 636\n","[ Diatoms from Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego ]\n","636\n","[ Publisher This chapter discusses the importance of diatoms for characterizing aquatic paleoenvironments in high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere .

Direct human activities, mainly fisheries, were the major source of threats. 51% of marine mammal core habitat has been reported to be affected by risk. Marine mammal communities are at high-risk in 47% of coastal waters worldwide. , Marine mammals are impacted by many anthropogenic activities and mitigating these impacts requires knowledge about the geographic occurrence of threats. Here, we systematically reviewed, categorized and geo-referenced information from &gt;1780 publications about threats affecting 121 marine mammal species worldwide between 1991 and 2016. We created risk maps by assigning threat to countries where they had been reported, further refining spatial allocation to specific ocean basins and Longhurst biogeographical provinces and subsequent intersection with mapped species' distributions. We superimposed risk maps for different taxa and threats to visualize geographic patterns of risks and quantify risk severity with respect to number of species affected. Almost all marine mammal species have been reported to face at least one threat. Incidental catch affected the most species (112 species), followed by pollution (99 species), direct harvesting (89 species) and traffic-related impacts (86 species). Direct human activities, mainly fisheries, urban development, whaling/hunting and tourism were the major source of threats affecting most species (&gt;60 species). Risk areas were identified for 51% of marine mammal core habitat. Besides, the majority of local marine mammal communities are at high-risk in 47% of world coastal-waters. Hotspots were located mainly in temperate and polar coastal waters and in enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean or Baltic Sea. However, risk areas differed by threat types and taxa. Our maps show that human activities in coastal waters worldwide impose previously unrecognized levels of cumulative risk for most of marine mammal species, and provide a spatially explicit frame of reference for the assessment of mammals' species conservation status. ]\n","637\n","iteracion 638\n","[ A review of methods and indicators used to evaluate the ecological modifications generated by artificial structures on marine ecosystems ]\n","638\n","[ Highlights This study comprehensively reviews methods for assessing the ecological modifications generated by artificial structures on marine settings.

We highlighted a lack of reliable methods for the assessment of epibenthic colonization, useful recommendations to fill this gap were provided. We provide stakeholders with a catalogue of useful tools to characterize ecological impacts associated with AS, allowing to draw lessons for future deployments. , The current development of human activities at sea (e.g. land reclamation , maritime activity and marine renewable energy) is leading to a significant increase in the number of infrastructures installed in marine settings. These artificial structures provide new hard-bottom habitats for many marine organisms and can thus modify the structure and functioning of coastal ecosystems . In order to better evaluate the nature of these modifications as well as the potential benefits and/or impacts generated, it becomes essential to develop assessment methods that can be applied to a wide variety of study sites from harbours to coastal offshore environments. In this context, our study aims to review the different methods and indicators available which are used to measure the modifications of biodiversity and ecological functioning generated by such structures. Among the methods reviewed, we highlight some that were developed specifically for artificial structures, and others intended for various primary uses but which have been successfully transposed to artificial structures. Nevertheless, we also point out the lack of reliable methods concerning some biological ecosystem components impacted by artificial structures. In this context, we require the adaptation or creation of brand-new indicators to achieve a better characterisation of the ecological impacts generated by these structures.

After identifying the geographical regions with the highest wave power, 15 reference points, which were considered more relevant from the point of view of their wave energy potential, have been defined in each hemisphere (northern and southern, respectively). As a following step, corresponding to all of these reference points, the most relevant wave patterns have been identified, and this information was subsequently used to assess the expected power output of the wave energy converters considered. Some other relevant parameters, such as the capacity factor or the capture width, were evaluated as well. Following the results provided by this work, we can expect that most of the existent devices for harnessing wave energy would perform well near most of the coastal environments identified.

This has presented different solutions to assess the presence of these pollutants in the natural environment, bringing the science forward. Microplastics have been reported worldwide across different biological levels and environmental compartments.

However, so far, the multiple forms of this environmental issue have mainly been analysed in international scientific literature in a narrow traditional manner, frequently based on approaching a relatively low number of ordinary land degradation processes. Consequently, as this complex process has not been sufficiently well explored, this study aims to investigate global land degradation in an interdisciplinary and holistic manner, in terms of the multidimensional nature, causes, spatial footprint, multiple consequences (for the ecological and anthropogenic systems worldwide, but also for the global climate system) and various solutions to mitigate worldwide land multi-degradation. Based on various information investigated in more than 500 reliable scientific papers, the findings of this review paper showed that there currently are 17 land degradation pathways (aridity, biological invasions, coastal erosion , land erosion by water, land erosion by wind, land pollution, land subsidence , landslides, permafrost thawing, salinization , soil acidification , soil biodiversity loss, soil compaction, soil organic carbon loss, soil sealing, vegetation degradation and waterlogging), which are active on various spatial scales across the planet. Five of the seventeen land degradation dimensions were considered major land degradation pathways and explored in detail in this study (aridity, land erosion by water, salinization , soil organic carbon loss and vegetation degradation), considering several relevant criteria outlined in the paper (global spatial footprint, data availability, and impact on agricultural, ecological and climate systems). Essentially, it was found that the five global degradation processes significantly erode the multiple ecosystem functions and services of worldwide land systems, which are crucial for human wellbeing, life support and the Earth systems’ stability. Nonetheless, other land degradation processes can also be considered major land degradative pathways, although a main current impediment in their detailed investigation is the general lack of global data availability. Therefore, the study highlights the complexity and severity of global land degradation, and draws attention to the need for other studies to approach land degradation multidimensionally, which goes beyond the traditional perspectives focused on the conventional processes of water erosion, wind erosion or soil salinization. At the same time, the study highlights the fact that land degradation must be an urgent priority in governmental and international policies, which can rely on a wide range of control measures that are currently available (some of the relevant ones are explored in this paper) for combating this disrupting environmental process rapidly, efficiently and on a large scale throughout the world. ]\n","642\n","iteracion 643\n","[ Fine sediment effects on seagrasses: A global review, quantitative synthesis and multi-stressor model ]\n","643\n","[ Highlights Global review of fine sediment effects on seagrasses.

Most citations (104) investigated multi-mode impacts of sediments, but the most frequently investigated single mode was light reduction (57 citations), followed by substrate rhizosphere chemistry (31) then smothering effects (6). Mud with high organic content is particularly problematic and smaller seagrasses are particularly vulnerable. Research gaps include polyphasic approaches, and studies of interactions between smothering, rhizosphere biogeochemistry and light climate. Identifying the thresholds of seagrass health indicators under mud stress should benefit coastal resource management, enabling improved decision-making and implementation of protective actions. ]\n","643\n","iteracion 644\n","[ A review of stressors, uses and management perspectives for the larger Jakarta Bay Area, Indonesia ]\n","644\n","[]\n","644\n","iteracion 645\n","[ Morphodynamics of prograding beaches: A synthesis of seasonal- to century-scale observations of the Columbia River littoral cell ]\n","645\n","[ Highlights Findings associated with the morphodynamics of prograding beaches are synthesized. Rates and dominant processes vary depending on time scale and morphological unit. Sand supply from the lower shoreface is more widespread than commonly believed. Predictions of coastal response depend on sediment flux pathways and budgets. , Findings from nearly two decades of research focused on the Columbia River littoral cell (CRLC), a set of rapidly prograding coastal barriers and strand-plains in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, are synthesized to investigate the morphodynamics associated with prograding beaches. Due to a large sediment supply from the Columbia River, the CRLC is the only extensive stretch of shoreline on the U.S. west coast to have advanced significantly seaward during the late Holocene . Since the last Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake in 1700, with associated co-seismic subsidence and tsunami, much of the CRLC has prograded hundreds of meters. However, the rates of progradation , and the processes most responsible for sediment accumulation, vary depending on time scale and the morphological unit in question. Remarkably, the 20th and early 21st century shoreline change rates were more than double the late prehistoric rates that include recovery from the last major CSZ event, most likely due to an increase in sediment supply resulting from inlet jetty construction. In some locations detailed beach morphology monitoring reveals that at interannual- to decadal-scale the upper shoreface aggraded about 2 cm/yr, subtidal sandbars migrated offshore and decayed while intertidal bars migrated onshore and welded to the shoreline, the shoreline prograded about 4 m/yr, and 1 to 2 new foredune ridges were generated. A detailed meso-scale sediment budget analysis in one location within the littoral cell shows that approximately 100 m 3 /m/yr accumulated between − 12 m (seaward limit of data) and + 9 m (crest of landward-most foredune). Gradients in alongshore sediment transport , net onshore-directed cross-shore sediment transport within the surf zone , and cross-shore feeding from a shoreface out of equilibrium with forcing conditions are each partially responsible for the significant rates of sediment supplied to the beaches and dunes of the CRLC during the observational period. Direct observations of beach progradation at seasonal- to decadal-scale are put in context of measured or inferred changes over time scales of decades to centuries. ]\n","645\n","iteracion 646\n","[ The impact of improper solid waste management to plastic pollution in Indonesian coast and marine environment ]\n","646\n","[ Highlights 10 plastic pollution studies have been reported in Indonesian coastal and marine environment to date.

Infants cannot suffer of a potential health risk through breastfeeding other than DDT, HCB, and PCBs. , Although some persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were prohibited or limited in use several decades ago, they are still frequently detected in the human body. The purpose of this study was to understand the levels and profiles of POPs in breast milk in China and assess their potential health risks among breastfed infants under six months of age. A literature review focused on China was performed for studies published from 2001 to 2020. The POP levels in breast milk along with other important variables were extracted, and then the average individual POP levels in breast milk were estimated. This review summarises the distribution of traditional and new POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), legacy brominated flame retardants (BFRs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and chlorinated paraffins (CPs) and reported notably high levels of short-chain chlorinated paraffins and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis ( p -chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p’-DDE) in breast milk.

This has the potential to adversely affect nesting sea turtles, particularly the leatherback turtle ( Dermochelys coriacea ) for which Gabon constitutes the world’s largest rookery. In this study, we analyse aerial survey data (2003, 2007 and 2011) to determine the temporal persistence and spatial extent of beached timber, and by integrating spatial data on nesting, ascertain regions where beached timber poses the greatest threat to nesting leatherback turtles. There was no marked difference in the number of beached logs recorded across the study area during the period, with 15,160, 13,528 and 17,262 logs recorded in the three years, respectively. There was, however, a significant difference in abundance of beached logs among geographical areas. Analysis highlighted two coastal areas where nesting leatherback turtles were likely to be at greatest risk from beached timber. At one such site, Kingere, within Pongara National Park, where both logs and turtle densities are high, monitoring in 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 suggested that between 1.6% and 4.4% of leatherback turtles could be entrapped at this site. Given the dynamic nature of Gabon’s coastal environment, and the potential limitations of aerial surveys, densities of beached timber could be greater than this analysis reveals.

Mean oxygen consumption reflected a minimum seasonal turnover of 3.1 g N/m 2 in the south-eastern North Sea, including denitrification of 1 g N/m 2 . Oxygen depletion was underestimated in shallow coastal waters due to repeated erosion of stratification as indicated by local high variability. ]\n","655\n","iteracion 656\n","[ Putative high-level toxicity pathways based on evidence of brevetoxin immunotoxicity in marine fauna ]\n","656\n","[ Highlights Brevetoxin exposure leads to human and wildlife health risks. Adverse outcome pathway for brevetoxin-induced immunotoxicity in marine fauna. The adverse outcome pathway can be implemented to guide future brevetoxin research. , Red tide events, caused by a toxin producing dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis, occur annually in Florida and Texas. These events lead to health risks for both humans and wildlife that utilize coastal environments. Brevetoxins, potent lipophilic neurotoxins produced by K. brevis , modulate immune responses in laboratory studies with model organisms and in the natural environment in both humans and wildlife. Studies show that brevetoxins activate immune cells, stimulate production of gamma-globulins, cytokines, and neutrophils, modulate lysozyme activity, induce apoptosis, and modulate lymphocyte proliferation in marine species. The objective of this review was to summarize brevetoxin-induced immunotoxicity in marine animals based on available peer-reviewed literature about K. brevis blooms and associated health concerns and propose putative toxicity pathways. This review identifies knowledge gaps within current brevetoxin induced immunotoxicity research, including assessing the long-term impacts of brevetoxin exposure, elucidating the mechanistic linkages between brevetoxins and immune cells, and evaluating repeated and chronic versus acute brevetoxin exposure implications on overall organismal health. The putative immunotoxicity pathways based on evidence from brevetoxin-exposure in marine fauna described in this review represent a useful tool and resource for researchers, wildlife managers, and policy makers. This review and proposed putative immunotoxicity pathways will inform decisions regarding the risks of algal blooms, as it pertains to marine animal health. ]\n","656\n","iteracion 657\n","[ Tropical cyclones and climate change , Erratum regarding missing Declaration of Competing Interest statements in previously published articles ]\n","657\n","[ Since the Eighth International Workshop on Tropical Cyclones (IWTC-8), held in December 2014, progress has been made in our understanding of the relationship between tropical cyclone (TC) characteristics, climate and climate change.

However, pollution from domestic and industry sources, over-exploitation of fisheries and poorly planned and managed coastal developments and near-shore activities are resulting in a rapid degradation of vulnerable coastal and offshore habitats and shared living marine resources of the GCLME putting the economies and health of the populace at risk. The deterioration in water quality (chronic and catastrophic) from land and sea-based activities (especially industrial, agricultural, urban and domestic sewage run-off and mining activities including the oil and gas sector), eutrophication and harmful algal blooms have been identified as a major transboundary environmental problem by the countries in the adopted Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA). Arising from the results of the various environmental and socio-economic studies and assessments conducted over the years as documented in the Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA), the countries resolved to adopt a holistic, multi-sectoral and regional approach embodied in the large marine ecosystem concept for transboundary pollution management in the region.

In this paper, we review previous studies that explored the relations between sea-level rise and shoreline changes over the last few decades. Existing methods can be classified into two groups: (1) approaches based on the analysis of trends and variability in shoreline change observations, which investigate whether a correlation with the temporal or spatial patterns sea level changes can be established; and (2) approaches based on the comparison of shoreline observations with a coastal model outcome, which attempt to evaluate the contribution of sea-level rise to shoreline mobility using coastal evolution modeling tools. The existing applications of these methods face two common difficulties: first, shoreline data are often lacking or insufficiently resolved temporally to capture the dynamics of coastlines; and second, relative sea level along the coast is generally only known in a limited number of areas where tide gauges are available. These two challenges can be met, owing to the increasing amount of shoreline change observations and complementary geodetic techniques. The wide range of different interpretations regarding the role of sea-level rise in recent shoreline changes highlights the necessity to conduct specific studies that rely on local observations and models applicable in the local geomorphological context. ]\n","659\n","iteracion 660\n","[ An analysis of the spatial and temporal differentiation and driving factors of the marine resource curse in China ]\n","660\n","[ Highlights Excessive dependence on marine resources in China led to predatory exploitation. This resulted in a “marine resource curse” and economic development problems. Several factors drive its spatial and temporal evolution. A regression model was derived for the significant driving factors. Areas severely affected by this marine resource curse have a clear southward trend. , Based on the connotation of a so-called resource curse, this paper uses panel data from 11 coastal provinces in China to explore the spatial and temporal evolution of the marine resource curse in China by calculating its coefficient using the kernel density estimation model and GIS spatial analysis techniques. The generalized method of moments estimation is adopted to quantitatively study the factors driving the marine resource curse in China. The results show the following. 1) From 1996 to 2014, the marine resource curse coefficient in China exhibited a declining trend and the phenomenon abated slightly, gradually narrowing the gap between the coastal provinces. 2) The spatial evolution of the marine resource curse in China clearly shows a southward trend in terms of severely affected areas. The edge area of the marine resource curse curve first showed an increase and then declined. There was little change in the main distribution area not affected by the marine resource curse. Among those coastal areas, the marine resource curse in Hebei, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Guangdong improved with trends in development, while the situation in Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Hainan deteriorated. The situation in Tianjin fluctuated, while that in Shandong, Shanghai, and Fujian did not change significantly. 3) The main driving factors of the marine resource curse in China include the level of material capital investment, the degree of openness to the outside world, the structure of the marine industry, and the capability for scientific and technological innovation. These factors have differing yet significant impacts on the marine resource curse: the level of material capital investment has a significantly positive impact on the marine resource curse in China, while the other driving factors have negative impacts. ]\n","660\n","iteracion 661\n","[ Environmental effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill: A review ]\n","661\n","[ Highlights The environmental fate of spilled oil and gas The biological/ecotoxicological effects in offshore ecosystems The effects in nearshore and coastal sites The effects on long-lived marine organisms , The Deepwater Horizon oil spill constituted an ecosystem-level injury in the northern Gulf of Mexico .

The decay-series isotopes that have been exploited for ocean mixing studies are the four radium isotopes ( 226 Ra, 228 Ra, 224 Ra, and 223 Ra), 222 Rn, and 227 Ac. In addition, particle-reactive radionuclides ( 230 Th, 231 Pa, and 210 Pb) have been used to constrain basin-wide water residence or ventilation times. Isotopes of radium , 222 Rn, and 227 Ac have been used to trace mixing and circulation in the ocean because of their relatively high solubility in seawater and suitable half-lives. 226 Ra has a suitable radioactive mean-life, ∼2,300y, for large-scale oceanic mixing studies. The small-scale temporal and spatial variability generally associated with coastal mixing processes accentuates the integrating power of the 228 Ra tracer. Along with the three other radium isotopes of the “radium quartet,” 228 Ra is steadily input to coastal waters by desorption and diffusion from shelf, estuarine, and/or marsh sediments and through submarine groundwater discharge. Water close to the shore thus has a continual supply of these Ra isotopes despite their short decay lives. Produced in seawater by the decay of 226 Ra, 222 Rn in the ocean has activities equal to those of 226 Ra except in regions of the air–sea and sediment–sea interfaces. Exceptionally high apparent vertical mixing has been observed in deep-ocean passages, where the interplay between strong bottom water flows, manganese nodule occurrence, and high standing crop of excess 222 Rn is much in evidence. Several studies have explored the use of 227 Ac for tracing basin-wide circulation and mixing on decadal time-scales. The potential of 227 Ac as a tracer appears to lie chiefly in assessing diapycnal mixing in the deep sea. ]\n","663\n","iteracion 664\n","[ Aquaculture: Relevance, distribution, impacts and spatial assessments – A review ]\n","664\n","[ Highlights Highlights the current status and dynamics of aquaculture in global and regional scales.

Seven sea reclamation management measures, China has implemented with the management philosophy of total amount control and intensive use, and their effects are generally introduced. The paper concludes that, with China's economy stepping into the stage of stable growth, sea reclamation demands for industrial construction and town expanding has decreased, while demand for coastal tourism and public space will increase gradually. , Over the last decade, China's annual average reclamation area has been approximately 100 km 2 . Sea reclamation provides a space guarantee for industrialization and urbanization and is a motivating force for China's rapid economic growth. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of sea reclamation has caused problems due to the oversized scale and extensive use of the sea, resulting in the loss of large quantities of coastal shoal wetlands and natural shorelines and leading to continued deterioration of marine ecological environment. China has attached great importance to sea reclamation management. In order to strengthen sea reclamation management and to protect the marine environment, China has developed seven management system measures. These measures include a sea reclamation plan, marine functional zoning, regional sea use planning, a plane design for sea reclamation, a control index of the sea area for projects, sea area use demonstration and environmental impact evaluations, as well as an examination and approval administration with the management philosophy of total amount control and intensive use. At present, China's economic development faces a “new normal”, as industrial and urban demands on sea reclamation will gradually become more reasonable, and the primary application of sea reclamation will transition to coastal tourism, construction of the area close to sea, and recovery and repair of the coastal zone. In the future, China will continue to implement strict sea reclamation management based on ecological system recovery and public participation. In this essay, the system, experience and future development trends of sea reclamation management in China is comprehensively introduced in an effort to provide reference sea reclamation management plans to other countries around the world. ]\n","667\n","iteracion 668\n","[ Microplastics in Latin America and the Caribbean: A review on current status and perspectives ]\n","668\n","[ Highlights Most of the studies in LAC were focused on occurrence and effects of MPs in biota.

This flux was reduced to 0.19 Pg C yr −1 when we took into account DOC removal during its transport into the Arctic. When we further adopted an average removal rate of 10% for the rest of the river DOC input into the coastal ocean, we obtained an estimate of the global river DOC flux of 0.17 Pg C yr −1 , which is at the lower end of prior estimations.

However, only recently has the refinement of dating techniques made possible the use of paleoshorelines as reliable tools for tectonic studies. Although there are many local studies of Quaternary vertical motions of coastlines, we know of no comprehensive worldwide synthesis. Here we provide a compilation of 890 records of paleoshoreline sequences, with particular emphasis on the last interglacial stage (Marine Isotopic Stage [MIS] 5e, ~ 122 ka). The quality of dating MIS 5e makes it a reliable marker to evaluate vertical ground motion rates during the late Quaternary on a global scale. The results show that most coastal segments have risen relative to sea-level with a mean uplift rate higher than 0.2 mm/yr, i.e. more than four times faster than the estimated eustatic drop in sea level. The results also reveal that the uplift rate is faster on average for active margins than for passive margins. Neither dynamic topography nor glacio-hydro-isostasy may explain sustained uplift of all continental margins , as revealed by the wide distribution of uplifted sequences of paleoshorelines. Instead, we suggest that only plate-tectonic processes reconcile all observations of Quaternary coastal uplift. We propose that long-term continental accretion has led to compression of continental plates and uplift of their margins. Therefore this study concludes that plate-tectonics processes impact all margins and emphasizes the fact that the notion of a stable platform is unrealistic.

It is, therefore, important to understand the impact of these settlements on the evolution of clastic coasts. How did ancient societies exploit and adapt to deltaic environments? Here, we detail a typology of ancient harbours on clastic coasts using a suite of multidisciplinary case studies from the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.

In the second part, we highlight the existing gap for the application of DSS in fisheries, and how to develop a FRODSS considering the different types of fishing fleets.

Distant-water vessels are currently the fleet that can more easily benefit from FRODSS, and they are used as an example here. However, the rest of the fleets could also benefit through adequate adaptation to their operation characteristics, driven by their specific fishing gear and target species. ]\n","674\n","iteracion 675\n","[ Incorporating change in marine spatial planning: A review ]\n","675\n","[ Highlights Marine spatial planning (MSP) will influence sustainable use of the oceans globally.

Research agenda for Australia’s tropical hydrology in the face of water resource development and climate change. , Study region Tropical Australia. Study focus Streams and rivers of the Australian tropics have been the subject of substantial hydrological process research spanning the last 50 years. In this review, we highlight initial efforts to understand the hydrological response of forested ecosystems in the humid tropics , and how this has been more recently followed by work in savannas of the seasonal tropics. We describe recent findings from modelling and tracer studies and derive a framework of dominant hydrological processes for the region. We also detail five critical knowledge gaps that will require further attention with climate change and ongoing interest in development in the region. New hydrological insights for the region We outline the diversity of runoff generation mechanisms that prevail in the region and emphasise the role of connected wetlands and floodplains in catchment response. We discuss the prominence of focused, episodic recharge in the replenishment of groundwater stores across the region. We also review how climate change and potential water resource development projects may alter the hydrology of northern Australian catchments. Future research should focus on improving our physical understanding of key hydrological processes, as well as anticipate the likely effects of development and climate change on these processes. Intensive and long-term studies of experimental observatories , which capture the diversity in landscapes and climates of the region, will help frame sustainable water development policies in northern Australia. ]\n","678\n","iteracion 679\n","[ Non-targeted screening of disinfection by-products in desalination plants using mass spectrometry: A review ]\n","679\n","[ Highlights The use of non-targeted approaches for identifying disinfection by products is discussed.

Understanding the mechanisms causing MWPs is important to forecast future sea-level rise. , Submerged palaeo-shorelines on the central Mediterranean shelves, identified from high-resolution seismic profiles and bathymetric data, mark distinct water depths at which sea level stationed for a period of time during the relative sea-level rise that followed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The shorelines are commonly represented by palaeo-coastal cliffs and barrier-beaches that lie today at water depths between − 100 m and − 70 m, and between − 65 m and − 40 m, in most places irrespective of the different tectonic contexts, even in the presence of significant vertical rates. These morphological features are thought to have been drowned during melt-water pulses 1A and 1B, which occurred between 15 and 10 ka. The evidence presented here confirms drowned shorelines documented elsewhere at similar water depths and shows that melt-water pulses have punctuated the post-glacial relative sea-level rise with rates up to 60 mm/yr. for a few centuries. The identification of morphological features related to melt-water pulses in the central Mediterranean Sea has important implications to improve our knowledge on episodes of rapid glacio-eustatic sea-level rise.

Anthropogenic sources contributing to heavy metal pollution are identified. Metal contamination in a variety of marine organisms and sediments are reviewed. Measures that can contribute to heavy metal management in the Arabian Gulf are suggested. , The Arabian Gulf is considered among the highest anthropogenically impacted regions in the world. Heavy metals contamination in coastal and marine environments is becoming an increasingly serious threat to both the naturally stressed marine ecosystems and humans that rely on marine resources for food, industry and recreation. Heavy metals are introduced to coastal and marine environments through a variety of sources and activities including sewage and industrial effluents, brine discharges, coastal modifications and oil pollution. The present paper reviews heavy metal contamination in a variety of marine organisms, and sediments, and suggests measures for environmental management of heavy metal pollution in the Arabian Gulf. Most of the reviewed literature confirmed that heavy metal concentrations in marine organisms were generally within allowable concentrations and pose no threat to public health. Likewise, studies suggested that levels of heavy metals in marine sediments are similar or lower compared to other regions. However, localized hotspots of chronic metal pollution in areas influenced by industrial facilities, desalination plants, and oil refineries have been reported. Holistic spatial and temporal monitoring and comprehensive national and regional strategies are critical to combat and manage heavy metal pollution in the Arabian Gulf. ]\n","682\n","iteracion 683\n","[ Pollution status of the Bohai Sea: An overview of the environmental quality assessment related trace metals ]\n","683\n","[ It is well recognized that the ecosystem of the Bohai Sea is being rapidly degraded and the Sea has basically lost its function as a fishing ground. Billions of funds have been spent in slowing down, halting and finally reversing the environmental deterioration of the Bohai Sea. Although trace metals are routinely monitored, the data with high temporal resolution for a clear understanding of biogeochemical processes in the ecosystem of the Bohai Sea are insufficient, especially in the western literature. In this review, status of trace metal contamination in the Bohai Sea is assessed based on a comprehensive review of their concentrations recorded in the waters, sediments and organisms over the past decades. Studies show that metal contamination in the Bohai Sea is closely associated with the fast economic growth in the past decades. Concentrations of trace metals are high in coastal areas especially in the estuaries . Alarmingly high metal concentrations are observed in the waters, sediments and organisms from the western Bohai Bay and the northern Liaodong Bay, especially the coasts near Huludao in the northernmost area of the Bohai Sea, which is being polluted by industrial sewage from the surrounding areas. The knowledge of the speciation and fractionation of trace metals and the influence of submarine groundwater discharge on the biogeochemistry of trace metals in the Bohai Sea is far from enough and related work needs to be done urgently to get a better understanding of the influence of trace metals on the ecosystem of the Bohai Sea. A clear understanding of the trace metal pollution status of the Bohai Sea could not be achieved presently for lack of systematic cooperation in different research fields.

Coral reef ecosystems are under severe threat from both local and global threats, which are degrading the ecosystem services that they provide to humanity. Past studies have assumed that the loss of ecosystem services will lead to a proportionate impact on people. We argue that this is unlikely to be the case in the short-term due to the high level of adaptability illustrated by communities associated with coral reefs. Eventually, however, stress will reach levels that exhaust the capacity of people and communities to adapt. Data sets and analysis are sparse, however, we call for a greater focus on understanding the flexibility and adaptability of people associated with coral reefs, especially in a time of rapid global change. , Coral reefs are biodiverse and productive ecosystems but are threatened by local and global stresses. The resulting loss of coral reefs is threatening coastal food and livelihoods. Climate projections suggest that coral reefs will continue to undergo major changes even if the goals of the Paris Agreement (Dec 2015) are successfully implemented. Ecological changes include modified food webs, shifts in community structure, reduced habitat complexity, decreased fecundity and recruitment, changes to fisheries productivity/opportunity, and a shift in the carbonate budget of some ecosystems toward dissolution and erosion of calcium carbonate stocks. Broad estimates of the long-term (present value) of services provided by the ocean’s ecological assets exist and are useful in highlighting the value of reefs yet must be contextualised by how people respond under ecosystem change. The dynamic nature of the relationship between people, economies, and the environment complicates estimation of human consequences and economic outcomes of changing environmental and ecological capital. Challenges have increased given lack of baseline data and our inability to predict (with any precision) how people respond to changing coral reef conditions, especially given the variability, flexibility, and creativity shown by human communities and economies under change. Here, we explore how the changes to the three-dimensional structure of coral reefs affect benefits for people, specifically coastal protection, fisheries habitat, and tourism. Based on a review of available data and literature, we make a series of key recommendations that are required to better understanding of how global change will affect people dependent on coral reefs. These include: (1) baseline studies and frameworks for understanding human responses to climate change within complex social and ecological setting such as coral reefs, (2) better tools for exploring environmental benefits, markets, and financial systems faced by change, and (3) the integration of these insights into more effective policy making. ]\n","684\n","iteracion 685\n","[ Nutrients in estuaries — An overview and the potential impacts of climate change ]\n","685\n","[ The fate and cycling of macronutrients introduced into estuaries depend upon a range of interlinked processes. Hydrodynamics and morphology in combination with freshwater inflow control the freshwater flushing time, and the timescale for biogeochemical processes to operate that include microbial activity, particle-dissolved phase interactions, and benthic exchanges. In some systems atmospheric inputs and exchanges with coastal waters can also be important. Climate change will affect nutrient inputs and behaviour through modifications to temperature, wind patterns, the hydrological cycle, and sea level rise. Resulting impacts include: 1) inundation of freshwater systems 2) changes in stratification, flushing times and phytoplankton productivity 3) increased coastal storm activity 4) changes in species and ecosystem function. A combination of continuing high inputs of nutrients through human activity and climate change is anticipated to lead to enhanced eutrophication in the future. The most obvious impacts of increasing global temperature will be in sub-arctic systems where permafrost zones will be reduced in combination with enhanced inputs from glacial systems. Improved process understanding in several key areas including cycling of organic N and P, benthic exchanges, resuspension, impact of bio-irrigation, particle interactions, submarine groundwater discharges, and rates and magnitude of bacterially-driven recycling processes, is needed. Development of high frequency in situ nutrient analysis systems will provide data to improve predictive models that need to incorporate a wider variety of key factors, although the complexity of estuarine systems makes such modelling a challenge. However, overall a more holistic approach is needed to effectively understand, predict and manage the impact of macronutrients on estuaries. ]\n","685\n","iteracion 686\n","[ Sedimentary system response to the global sea level change in the East China Seas since the last glacial maximum ]\n","686\n","[ The East China Seas (ECS) is one of the world's largest continental shelf seas. Based on the combination of global sea level change and sequence stratigraphy , we systematically investigated the evolution of sedimentary system in the ECS since the last glacial maximum (LGM). We have defined the transgressive boundary layer and constructed several sedimentary models of the ECS on the sequence stratigraphy and evolution of tidal sand ridges since the LGM, and sediment “source to sink” during the high sea level. The result shows that the ECS represent a typical case for large-scale continental shelf response to the global sea level change . Three sedimentary system tracts had been formed in the ECS since the LGM. First is the lowstand system tract corresponding to the late of last glaciation and LGM (23–15.4 cal. kyr B.P.). The progressive wedge occurred along the Okinawa Trough slope and the paleo-coastal zone (PCZ) along the continental shelf edge. Second is the transgressive system tract corresponding to the last deglaciation (15.4–7 cal. kyr B.P.). A large-scale transgressive boundary layer and tidal sand ridges were formed in this stage. Third is the highstand system tract corresponding to the high sea level since 7 cal. kyr B.P. The eddy mud, coastal current mud, present tidal sand ridge, delta, tidal flat and beach have been accumulating since then. The global sea level change after LGM can be divided into seven phases, of which four rapidly rising phases (RRP, I, II, III, IV) and three slowly rising phases (SRP, I, II, III) are distinguished. The tidal sand ridges were formed in the SRP and transgressive boundary layer in the RRP. The tidal sand ridges can be divided into three types including radicalized, channel and emanative. The modern circulation current system of the ECS had been built in the end of the last deglaciation . The effect of sediment “source to sink” in the ECS is closely correlative to the current system driven by the interaction of the East Asian monsoon and Kuroshio. The major sediment source is from the river discharge of the Huanghe and Changjiang River, and coastal resuspension . The muddy sediment in the eddy and coastal current, which cover the tidal sand ridges and transgressive boundary layer, is a major sediment sink in the modern ECS. ]\n","686\n","iteracion 687\n","[ Eutrophication science: where do we go from here? ]\n","687\n","[ Cultural eutrophication has become the primary water quality issue for most of the freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems in the world.

Habitat types in Lake Nokoué have been profoundly impacted by the urbanisation around the lake. Kilometres of riparian habitat including mangrove vegetation were destroyed on the south and western shoreline of the lake, removing the natural protection of the ecosystem to the increasing sewage nutrient load. In addition, to this anthropogenic pressure, the solid wastes from the villages on stilts (Ganvié’s villages) increased the nutrient enrichment of the lake. Consequently, the lake experience a seasonal bloom of water hyacinth which dies and sinks to its bottom each year when the salinity rises above 6 ppt. Note that the salinity dynamics of the lake is governed by its hydrological regime which was highly affected by the widening of the sea entrance into the lake around 1960. In addition to these changes, the intensification of the acadja fishing practice has led to the exportation of tonnes of dry woods into the lake. The decay of these woods combined with the accumulation of hyacinth detritus has disturbed the habitats of macroinvertebrates and fish. There is a progressive shift in the system from freshwater species to marine water species and from insectivorous fish to detritivorous fish. Management solutions required reduction of both detritus accumulation and external nutrient load. ]\n","688\n","iteracion 689\n","[ Small-scale fisheries in the south Aegean Sea: métiers and associated economics ]\n","689\n","[ Highlights Economic performance indicators data analysis of the small scale fishing fleet.

This study presents the small-scale fishery of the Dodecanese Islands (Kalymnos, Kos, Leros, Patmos, Symi) where the largest small-scale fleet in the eastern Mediterranean is located. The aim is to evaluate the economic viability of small scale fishing fleets, based on calculating economic performance and by using linear regression models.

The first section of this paper summarizes the concepts associated with vulnerability, natural hazards and climate change. The most widely adopted analytical approaches to vulnerability assessment are described, including spatial scales , the need for hybrid approaches comprising both biophysical and social dimensions of vulnerability, and the gradual incorporation of resilience aspects into such methodologies. In particular, the development and application of vulnerability indices is examined, based on a review of more than 50 studies that applied such indices across a range of hazards. The analytical procedures, proposed typologies, and most commonly selected variables are discussed. This overview demonstrates the breadth of vulnerability studies. This leads inevitably to lack of standardization of concepts and assumptions, which results in limited comparability between outputs for coasts from different areas. However, the widespread demand for vulnerability assessment as a component of decision-making in integrated management of the coast justifies pursuing indicator-based vulnerability assessments. In some cases these will explicitly adopt a consistent methodology that enables comparison between sites, whereas alternatively, metrics may be developed that are designed around particular system components and the site-specific functions for which they are valued. ]\n","690\n","iteracion 691\n","[ Contribution of electrical resistivity tomography to the study of detrital aquifers affected by seawater intrusion–extrusion effects: The river Vélez delta (Vélez-Málaga, southern Spain) ]\n","691\n","[ The coastal aquifer of the Plio-Quaternary delta sediment deposits of the Vélez river (province of Málaga, Spain) presents a highly irregular basement morphology and widely varying fill thickness (10–80 m between neighbouring sectors). The basin, which is tectonically controlled, is filled with lutite facies alternating with channel-filling rudites. This detrital aquifer is affected by seasonal seawater intrusion–extrusion processes due to increasing withdrawal of groundwater for human consumption and irrigation during dry periods. A study was performed to improve the hydrogeological knowledge of this coastal aquifer system. The study examined the morphology of the impervious substratum, the facies distribution and the position of the seawater wedge. For this purpose, an Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) geophysical technique was used and the tomographic data were calibrated using geological observations and borehole studies. An analysis was carried out to compare the direct information obtained from the 35 boreholes with the indirect data corresponding to the four electrical tomography profiles. In the study, over 9660 resistivity data points were processed. The ERT profiles perfectly corroborated the information derived from the boreholes. The profiles made it possible to detect thickness changes, lithological changes and the presence of faults. Moreover, from a hydrogeologic standpoint, this research technique is capable of detecting the position of the phreatic level and, in coastal aquifers such as the one examined in this study, the possible horizontal or vertical penetration of seawater intrusion. Therefore, the electrical geophysical prospecting based on ERT can be highly useful in areas lacking sufficient geological information and/or mechanical borehole data. ]\n","691\n","iteracion 692\n","[ Crustaceans in changing climate: Global warming and invasion of tropical land hermit crabs (Crustacea: Decapoda: Anomura: Coenobitidae) into temperate area in Japan ]\n","692\n","[ Highlights Recent global warming on coastal area promotes northern expansion of distribution of tropical biota to temperate areas.

Bangladesh and the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD) have been highlighted as a region at risk from sea-level rise, but reliable estimates of land subsidence have been limited. While early studies suggested high rates of relative sea-level rise, recent papers estimate more modest rates. Our objective is to better quantify the magnitude, spatial variability, and depth variation of sediment compaction and land subsidence in the lower GBD to better evaluate the processes controlling them and the pattern of relative sea level rise in this vulnerable region. We combine subsidence and compaction estimates from hand-drilled tube wells and historic sites (1–5 mm/y), GNSS and river gauges (4–8 mm/y) and RSET-MH and borehole vertical strainmeters (9–10 mm/y) in SW Bangladesh. The differences between the different types of measurements reflect the different timescales, spatial distribution and depth sensitivity of the different observations. Rates are lower for times &gt;300y providing data on the timescale of compaction. We also observe differences related to the degree to which different devices measure shallow and deep subsidence. Higher values reflect a greater component of subsidence from young shallow deposits from soil compaction and organic matter degradation. Thus, we observe different rates for different environments and physical settings. These differences indicate that in planning adaptation for rising sea level , hard construction with a solid foundation may experience different subsidence rates than open fields or reclaimed land with recent natural or anthropogenic sedimentation. Significance statement Land subsidence increases the impact of sea level rise. We combine six different types of measurements that examine land subsidence in coastal Bangladesh. The results show that causes of subsidence, including compaction of the sediments varies both spatially and with depth, and that compaction and organic matter degradation from young shallow deposits is a significant contribution to subsidence. This suggests that hard construction with a solid foundation, such as buildings and embankments , may experience a lower subsidence rates than open fields or reclaimed land with recent natural or anthropogenic sedimentation. ]\n","698\n","iteracion 699\n","[ Is Brazilian wind power development sustainable?

However, the architecture and evolution of its retroarc-arc-forearc system, which is important for us to understand the interaction or connection between continental and oceanic lithospheres , are ambiguous. Using multiple disciplinary data comprising seismic profiles, field observations and numerical paleo-topographies, this study synthetically focused on the Jurassic-Cretaceous evolution and geodynamics of the Andean-type Southeast China continental margin. Subduction of the paleo-Pacific Plate was initiated during the Early Jurassic (~200 Ma), generating a NNE-striking Jurassic magmatic arc along the East China Sea, bounded by imbricate thrust faults on both sides and coinciding with a paleo-topographic coastal mountain range. While the Jurassic arc erupted along an ENE-striking Triassic suture zone in the northern South China Sea, dominated by the Tethyan tectonic domain and overprinted by the Pacific tectonic domain. The Jurassic coastal mountain range began to collapse and transited into a rift basin at ~135 Ma and then the Andean-type continental margin gradually switched to the western Pacific-type during the Late Cretaceous (100–72 Ma), accompanied by Jurassic thrust faults inverting into Cretaceous detachment faults and magmatic arc migrated eastward to the Taiwan-Rukyu areas. Such eastward tectonic migration and transition is associated with the eastward retreat of the subducted paleo-Pacific slab. Then a regional latest Cretaceous (72–66 Ma) compression prevailed Southeast China, probably related to “ridge subduction” when the Pacific Plate replaced the paleo-Pacific Plate to subduct beneath East Asia. ]\n","702\n","iteracion 703\n","[ The role of the Atlantic Water in multidecadal ocean variability in the Nordic and Barents Seas ]\n","703\n","[ Highlights The warming Atlantic Water dominates decadal and longer-scale variability; its volume correlates with temperature and salinity . The warming/cooling periods follow the low/high NAO periods and the high/low AMO periods with a delay of 4–5 years. It takes about two years for a strong and broad-scale salinity anomaly (such as the GSA) to spread across the region. The warming/cooling events spread across the region in a year or less and propagate about twice faster the salinity anomalies. The difference between the propagation of salinity and temperature anomalies is because salinity is more subject to horizontal advection . , The focus of this work is on the temporal and spatial variability of the Atlantic Water (AW). We analyze the existing historic hydrographic data from the World Ocean Database to document the long-term variability of the AW throughflow across the Norwegian Sea to the western Barents Sea. Interannual-to-multidecadal variability of water temperature, salinity and density are analyzed along six composite sections crossing the AW flow and coastal currents at six selected locations. The stations are lined up from southwest to northeast – from the northern North Sea (69°N) throughout the Norwegian Sea to the Kola Section in the Barents Sea (33°30′E). The changing volume and characteristics of the AW throughflow dominate the hydrographic variability on decadal and longer time scales in the studied area. We examine the role of fluctuations of the volume of inflow versus the variable local factors, such as the air–sea interaction and mixing with the fresh coastal and cold Arctic waters, in controlling the long-term regional variability. It is shown that the volume of the AW, passing through the area and affecting the position of the outer edge of the warm and saline core, correlates well with temperature and salinity averaged over the central portions of the studied sections. The coastal flow (mostly associated with the Norwegian Coastal Current flowing over the continental shelf) is largely controlled by seasonal local heat and freshwater impacts. Temperature records at all six lines show a warming trend superimposed on a series of relatively warm and cold periods, which in most cases follow, with a delay of four to five years, the periods of relatively low and high North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the periods of relatively high and low Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), respectively. In general, there is a relatively high correlation between the year-to-year changes of the NAO and AMO indices, which is to some extent reflected in the (delayed) AW temperature fluctuations. It takes about two years for freshening and salinification events and a much shorter time (of about a year or less) for cooling and warming episodes to propagate or spread across the region. This significant difference in the propagation rates of salinity and temperature anomalies is explained by the leading role of horizontal advection in the propagation of salinity anomalies, whereas temperature is also controlled by the competing air–sea interaction along the AW throughflow. Therefore, although a water parcel moves within the flow as a whole, the temperature, salinity and density anomalies split and propagate separately, with the temperature and density signals leading relative to the salinity signal. A new hydrographic index, coastal-to-offshore density step, is introduced to capture variability in the strength of the AW volume transport. This index shows the same cycles of variability as observed in temperature, NAO and AMO but without an obvious trend. ]\n","703\n","iteracion 704\n","[ Low-head pumped hydro storage: A review on civil structure designs, legal and environmental aspects to make its realization feasible in seawater ]\n","704\n","[ Highlights Low-head pumped hydro storage projects have been designed but never constructed. Technologies from tidal energy plants and the Yanbaru pumped hydro plant are useful. Research on the response of fish to stress induced by seawater pumped hydro is needed. Main failure mechanisms for low-head PHS are soil uplift, piping and rapid drawdown. Legal and regulatory aspects are limiting factors for projects development. , The energy transition requires large-scale storage to provide long-term supply and short-term grid stability. Though pumped hydro storage is widely used for this purpose, regions without natural topography do not have the potential for traditional high-head pumped hydro storage. To address this, multiple projects for low-head and seawater pumped hydro storage have been proposed, though few have been implemented. Here, we review the state of the art of the components of low-head seawater pumped hydro storage projects, for construction in shallow seas or integrated into coastal defenses. We reference all civil infrastructure components, in addition to legal, environmental/biological, and financial constraints, drawing knowledge from proposed, planned, and constructed tidal power and seawater pumped hydro storage projects worldwide. Combining this knowledge, we make a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility for low-head seawater pumped hydro storage in the North Sea. We find that an elevated storage basin is more economical than an excavated one in shallow bathymetry (10 m deep or less), while the reverse is true in deeper water. Corrosion and fouling prevention are already well developed due to implementation of these measures at tidal power plants. Dam construction is feasible if measures are taken to address piping, macro-instability (primarily from rapid drawdown), and bursting of the clay layer. Within the context of Europe, legal and environmental regulations may be the most formidable hurdles to such projects. ]\n","704\n","iteracion 705\n","[ Ecosystem services and well-being dimensions related to urban green spaces – A systematic review ]\n","705\n","[ Highlights ES and UGS well-being dimensions are revised.

Five major physical processes control mud depocenter development. A dichotomy exists between episodic and long-term sedimentation. Episodic events likely influence mud depocenters in a range of oceanographic settings. Improvements of mud sedimentation parametrizations are necessary. , Mud depocenters (MDCs) represent major proximal-marine sinks for fine-grained terrigenous material, carbon, and contaminants on modern continental shelves . Throughout the past decades, several studies have shed light on the physical processes controlling MDC development at various timescales, ranging from controlled flume experiments and in-situ oceanographic monitoring, to stratigraphic analyses of recent and ancient deposits based on seismo-acoustic and sediment-core data. Thereby, key mechanisms related to the formation and maintenance dynamics of MDCs have been discovered: a) cross-shore bottom transport of suspended mud through gravity flows , b) interaction of mud with density gradients associated with oceanic fronts , c) resuspension and dispersal control of mud by internal waves , d) bedload deposition of mud forming laminated bedding under energetic flow conditions, and e) mud resuspension resulting from chronic bottom trawling . Among the physical processes identified or proposed, three conceptual paradigms for MDC development can be distinguished: 1. continuous supply , associated with a steady sediment supply and hemipelagic settling in relatively calm conditions; 2. continual resuspension-deposition cycles , wherein parts of an MDC area are subject to multiple cycles of resuspension, redeposition and reworking before ultimate burial; and 3. episodic sedimentation and erosion , in which extreme events such as riverine floods and atmospheric storms dominate the total, long-term sediment flux. Although the predominance of each of these paradigms within a single MDC depends to a large degree on the timescales considered, case studies tend to emphasize processes associated with only one of these three paradigms. As a result, the relative, long-term contribution of individual processes remains largely uncertain for many MDCs. The ability of numerical models to accurately predict medium to long-term mud accumulation is restricted not only by computational costs, but also by insufficient parametrizations of the muddy sedimentation process. These remain challenging to constrain due to the multiplicity and complexity of factors affecting the cohesive properties of mud, including its state of consolidation, and the amount and type of organic matter present. Bridging the gap between individual events and long-term accumulation is the key to a more complete understanding of sedimentation processes in MDCs. ]\n","706\n","iteracion 707\n","[ A synthetic review of remote sensing applications to detect nearshore bars ]\n","707\n","[ Highlights Synthesis of remote sensing techniques used to identify bar characteristics.

The benefits of co-management are ambiguous in long-term control of blasting. , Blast fishing (known variously as dynamite and bomb fishing) has caused long-term damage to reefs and coastal livelihoods for decades. Blasting reefs with explosives provides fish for commercial and consumption purposes across the globe, but the practice has also led to large-scale destruction of coral reefs in much of Southeast Asia, Tanzania, the Red Sea, and other areas in Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. Despite its destructive nature and widespread dispersion, there have been few reviews that offer insight to assist in analysing and managing this broad-scale threat. We address this gap with a comprehensive global analysis of the blast fishing literature to explore the distribution of blast fishing, primary drivers, ecological and economic implications and solutions. Our review analysed 212 papers from seven databases. Blasting is widespread, misreported, and ongoing. Lack of effective enforcement and governance drives blasting; socioeconomic causes may contribute but are not dominant. A combination of deterrence measures and co-managed marine protected areas (MPAs) emerges as the most effective solution to blasting.

Salinity tolerance in plants is a complex trait, with salinity negatively affecting crop yield. Plants adopt a range of mechanisms to combat salinity, with many transporter genes being implicated in Na + -partitioning processes. Within these, the high-affinity K + (HKT) family of transporters play a critical role in K + and Na + homeostasis in plants. Among HKT transporters, Type I transporters are Na + -specific. While Arabidopsis has only one Na + -specific HKT ( AtHKT1;1 ), cereal crops have a multiplicity of Type I and II HKT transporters. AtHKT1; 1 ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) and HKT1; 5 (cereal crops) ‘exclude’ Na + from the xylem into xylem parenchyma in the root, reducing shoot Na + and hence, confer sodium tolerance. However, more recent data from Arabidopsis and crop species show that At HKT1;1 / HKT1;5 alleles have a strong genetic association with ‘shoot sodium accumulation’ and concomitant salt tolerance. The review tries to resolve these two seemingly contradictory effects of AtHKT1;1 / HKT1;5 operation (shoot exclusion vs shoot accumulation), both conferring salinity tolerance and suggests that contrasting phenotypes are attributable to either hyper-functional or weak AtHKT1;1 / HKT1;5 alleles/haplotypes and are under strong selection by soil salinity levels. It also suggests that opposite balancing mechanisms involving xylem ion loading in these contrasting phenotypes exist that require transporters such as SOS1 and CCC.

Here we firstly summarize the most important processes of benthos affecting sediment stability and then explore existing biomorphodynamic modeling studies both at small- and large-scales. In general, microbenthos (body size &lt;0.1 mm) mainly stabilizes sediments while meio- (0.1–1 mm) and macrobenthos (&gt;1 mm) may stabilize or destabilize sediments. Among all types of sediment, fine-grained fraction (silt and clay) is most sensitive to the impact of benthos . Benthic organisms have the capability to mediate sediment transport and sedimentation patterns beyond their habitats on the long-term and over a large-scale. However, so far, numerical models evaluating benthic impact are limited to explorative studies and have not reached a stage where they can be used for predictive modeling. The barriers hindering a further development of biomorphodynamic models include not only limited understanding of fundamental biological/bio-physical processes affecting morphological development and dynamic feedback loops among them but also a shortage of data for model calibration and confirmation of simulation results. On the other hand, thriving for higher model complexity does not necessarily lead to better performance.

This includes wave shadowing by headlands and rock/coral formations inducing strong alongshore gradients in wave energy, resulting in corresponding variations in morphodynamic beach state and storm response. Geologically-induced rip currents including shadow rips, deflection rips and mega-rips that can develop on embayed beaches during storms, are an integral feature of the nearshore circulation and morphodynamics of geologically controlled beaches. We bring these processes together by presenting a conceptual model of alongshore and cross-shore levels of geological control. In the longshore dimension, this ranges from beaches that are slightly embayed, through to highly embayed beaches where headlands dominate the entire beach morphodynamic response. In the cross-shore dimension, this ranges from beaches without discernible geological controls, through to relict beaches above the influence of the contemporary littoral zone. Given the prevalence of geologically controlled beaches along the world's coasts, it is paramount for coastal management to consider how these beaches differ from unconstrained beaches and avoid applying inappropriate models and tools, especially with our uncertain future climate. ]\n","719\n","iteracion 720\n","[ Global sources, abundance, size, and distribution of microplastics in marine sediments - A critical review ]\n","720\n","[ Highlights 350 articles, at different sites (308) by the authors (1447) of countries (67) were identified.

The main question embedded in these scale differences is how cross-shore and longshore sediment transport processes intervene in the long-term evolution of wave-dominated shores. The problem may be considered in terms of a hierarchy of stepped processes within an overall framework of sediment mass continuity within the shoreface–beach system, more or less modulated by the numerous environmental parameters that may affect barrier development.

The first section of the chapter describes surf zone and beachface processes, and the second section focuses on processes affecting the upper beach and backshore zones, notably aeolian, storm erosion, and overwash.

Mangrove use dates back to pre-Columbian societies in the Americas. Mangrove area estimates are highly variable over time due to differing methodologies. Negative attitudes towards mangroves changed with demonstrated links to human wellbeing. Expanding human activities continue to threaten mangroves despite protection legislation. , From native pre-Columbian subsistence economies to the modern global economy, mangroves have played an important role providing goods and services to human societies for millennia. More than 90% of the world’s mangroves are located in developing countries, where rates of destruction are increasing rapidly and on large scales. In order to design effective conservation strategies, it is critical to understand the natural dynamics and anthropogenic drivers of these coastal wetland habitats. We use retrospective techniques to reconstruct mangrove forest history in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. We examine available, present day estimates of mangrove area and evaluate the representation of mangroves in the protected area systems of Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador, evaluating existing policies regarding mangroves. Archaeozoological evidence shows that mangroves were exploited for many thousands of years by pre-Columbian societies. Post-conquest deforestation prevailed during the next 400 years. Since 1990, despite increasingly positive attitudes towards mangroves and their inclusion in protected areas and conservation policies, mangrove cover has continued to decline due to expanding human activities (agriculture, aquaculture, coastal development), even in the presence of laws prohibiting their removal. Here we provide an historical ecology baseline of mangroves in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, from which to view current trends and map future trajectories. Given the myriad negative consequences of mangrove loss recorded worldwide, and the strong ecological connectivity of the region, developing effective strategies for mangrove management at an appropriate scale will be paramount to protect coastal livelihoods and biodiversity. ]\n","722\n","iteracion 723\n","[ Living with shore protection structures: A review ]\n","723\n","[ Shore protection structures will continue to be built and maintained to protect coastal infrastructure. This review identifies factors influencing our ability to retain or restore natural features or construct artificial habitats on beaches and dunes in the presence of these structures. Protection structures are visual and physical intrusions into natural landscapes, and they alter natural processes and introduce exotic habitat. Impacts on landforms and habitats vary depending on the type of structure and its size, shape, orientation, type of materials used, age and state of repair. Changes will occur to any structure through time, and decisions must be made to supplement, rebuild, replace, or remove them or allow them to deteriorate. Decisions about removing protection structures are problematic because they might already have habitat value, and the effects of removal are as difficult to predict as the effects of their original emplacement . Creative alternatives to traditional structures can be applied to retain or enhance some of the natural values of landforms and habitats. This can occur by making structures smaller, placing them below ground or water level, selecting construction materials that enhance habitat, or using beach fill to overcome undesirable effects. Decisions are required on whether the enhancement of habitat by modifying traditional structures is actually desirable. Humans must now be considered intrinsic agents of landscape evolution , and decisions on how, when and where to place, modify or remove protection structures depend on numerous human inputs, requiring interventions that have an interdisciplinary perspective and are placed in a societal context. ]\n","723\n","iteracion 724\n","[ Sediment transport on dissipative, intermediate and reflective beaches ]\n","724\n","[ In this paper, we review and synthesize field measurements of suspended sediment transport on the shoreface of dissipative, intermediate and reflective beach states. The morphodynamic beach state continuum was originally established in the 1970s but at the time, only hydrodynamic processes and morphologies in these various states were described. Since the early 1980s when sensors capable of resolving suspended sediment concentration at intra-wave time scale became available, many studies have examined suspended sediment transport by waves and currents on the shoreface. The synthesis of this work shows that the two end states in the morphodynamic continuum, which are the dissipative and reflective states, exhibit relatively small rates of cross-shore sediment transport and weak gradients in that transport which both ensure that the nearshore morphology is relatively stable. The intervening intermediate beach states typically exhibit prominent bar topographies and in these states, strong morphodynamic feedbacks between hydrodynamic processes and morphology create locally large transport rates and sharp transport gradients which is the reason for the dynamic nature of these beach states. Transport processes driving sediment onshore and offshore within beach states are discussed as well as the transport processes responsible for state transitions. ]\n","724\n","iteracion 725\n","[ On the need to integrate uncertainty into U.S. water resource planning ]\n","725\n","[ Highlights Strategies for addressing variability and uncertainty are rare (4% of states).

We examined the latest publicly-available, state-level guidance regarding the management of water supplies and demands concerning risks associated with drought, flooding, and climate change. We found state-level guidance supplementing the federally-backed flood mitigation program to be updated most regularly (54% in the last 5 years; 84% in the last decade). Yet, the underlying floodplain mapping data these local planning efforts rely on are acknowledged by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to be chronically outdated. Drought planning guidance was found to be most outdated (16% last updated in the last 5 years; 18% almost two decades ago), and across the U.S. , almost universally (94%) reactive (emergency response) rather than proactive (mitigation or management).

This paper synthesises greenhouse gas data measured in UK estuary studies, highlighting that urban wastewater loading is significantly correlated with both methane ( P &lt; 0.001) and nitrous oxide ( P &lt; 0.005) concentrations. It demonstrates that specific estuary typologies render them more sensitive to anthropogenic influences on greenhouse gas production, particularly estuaries that experience low oxygen levels due to reduced mixing and stratification or high sediment oxygen demand. Significantly, we find that estuaries with high urban wastewater loading may be hidden sources of greenhouse gases globally. Synthesising available information, a conceptual model for greenhouse gas concentrations in estuaries with different morphologies and mixing regimes is presented. Applications of this model should help identification of estuaries susceptible to anthropogenic impacts and potential hotspots for greenhouse gas emissions . ]\n","726\n","iteracion 727\n","[ Biogeochemical and ecological impacts of boundary currents in the Indian Ocean ]\n","727\n","[ Highlights Indian Ocean (IO) boundary currents are complex compared to the Atlantic and Pacific. The currents in the northern IO reverse seasonally and have large biological impacts. The Leeuwin Current flows poleward and sheds seaward-propagating eddies. The Agulhas Current is very large and generates eddies that propagate alongshore. Leeuwin and Agulhas Current eddies also have large biological impacts. , Monsoon forcing and the unique geomorphology of the Indian Ocean basin result in complex boundary currents, which are unique in many respects. In the northern Indian Ocean, several boundary current systems reverse seasonally. For example, upwelling coincident with northward-flowing currents along the coast of Oman during the Southwest Monsoon gives rise to high productivity which also alters nutrient stoichiometry and therefore, the species composition of the resulting phytoplankton blooms. During the Northeast Monsoon most of the northern Indian Ocean boundary currents reverse and favor downwelling. Higher trophic level species have evolved behavioral responses to these seasonally changing conditions. Examples from the western Arabian Sea include vertical feeding migrations of a copepod ( Calanoides carinatus ) and the reproductive cycle of a large pelagic fish ( Scomberomorus commerson ). The impacts of these seasonal current reversals and changes in upwelling and downwelling circulations are also manifested in West Indian coastal waters, where they influence dissolved oxygen concentrations and have been implicated in massive fish kills. The winds and boundary currents reverse seasonally in the Bay of Bengal, though the associated changes in upwelling and productivity are less pronounced. Nonetheless, their effects are observed on the East Indian shelf as, for example, seasonal changes in copepod abundance and zooplankton community structure. In contrast, south of Sri Lanka seasonal reversals in the boundary currents are associated with dramatic changes in the intensity of coastal upwelling, chlorophyll concentration, and catch per unit effort of fishes. Off the coast of Java, monsoon-driven changes in the currents and upwelling strongly impact chlorophyll concentrations, seasonal vertical migrations of zooplankton, and sardine catch in Bali Strait. In the southern hemisphere the Leeuwin is a downwelling-favorable current that flows southward along western Australia, though local wind forcing can lead to transient near shore current reversals and localized coastal upwelling. The poleward direction of this eastern boundary current is unique. Due to its high kinetic energy the Leeuwin Current sheds anomalous, relatively high chlorophyll, warm-core, downwelling eddies that transport coastal diatom communities westward into open ocean waters. Variations in the Leeuwin transport and eddy generation impact many higher trophic level species including the recruitment and fate of rock lobster ( Panulirus cygnus) larvae. In contrast, the transport of the Agulhas Current is very large, with sources derived from the Mozambique Channel, the East Madagascar Current and the southwest Indian Ocean sub-gyre. Dynamically, the Agulhas Current is upwelling favorable; however, the spatial distribution of prominent surface manifestations of upwelling is controlled by local wind and topographic forcing. Meanders and eddies in the Agulhas Current propagate alongshore and interact with seasonal changes in the winds and topographic features. These give rise to seasonally variable localized upwelling and downwelling circulations with commensurate changes in primary production and higher trophic level responses. Due to the strong influence of the Agulhas Current, many neritic fish species in southeast Africa coastal waters have evolved highly selective behaviors and reproductive patterns for successful retention of planktonic eggs and larvae. For example, part of the Southern African sardine ( Sardinops sagax ) stock undergoes a remarkable northward migration enhanced by transient cyclonic eddies in the shoreward boundary of the Agulhas Current. There is evidence from the paleoceanographic record that these currents and their biogeochemical and ecological impacts have changed significantly over glacial to interglacial timescales. These changes are explored as a means of providing insight into the potential impacts of climate change in the Indian Ocean. ]\n","727\n","iteracion 728\n","[ Integrative taxonomy of small worm lizards from Southern South America, with description of three new species (Amphisbaenia: Amphisbaenidae) ]\n","728\n","[ Fossorial vertebrates such as amphisbaenians suffer from morphological constraints as a result of their burrowing strategies.

Climate change alters many abiotic factors that affect their long-term persistence and distribution. Here, we review the existing scientific literature on the tolerance of key macroalgal species in the Baltic Sea, the world's largest brackish water body. Elevated temperature is expected to intensify coastal eutrophication , further promoting growth of opportunistic, filamentous species, especially green algae , which are often species associated with intensive filamentous algal blooms. Declining salinities will push the distributions of marine species towards south, which may alter the Baltic Sea community compositions towards a more limnic state. Together with increasing eutrophication trends this may cause losses in marine-originating foundation species such as Fucus , causing severe biodiversity impacts. Experimental results on ocean acidification effects on macroalgae are mixed, with only few studies conducted in the Baltic Sea.

Commonly, the Late Mesozoic orogenic processes were characterized by continent–continent collision, large-scale thrusting, strike-slip faulting and intense crustal shortening, crustal thickening, regional anatexis and metamorphism , followed by large-scale lithospheric extension, rifting and magmatism . To better understand the geological processes , this paper reviews and synthesizes existing multi-disciplinary geologic data related to sedimentation, tectonics, magmatism , metamorphism and geochemistry , and proposes a two-stage tectono-thermal evolutionary history of East Asia during the late Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (ca. 170–120 Ma). In the first stage, three orogenic belts along the continental margins were formed coevally at ca. 170–135 Ma, i.e., the north Mongol–Okhotsk orogen, the east paleo-Pacific coastal orogen, and the west Bangong–Nujiang orogen. Tectonism related to the coastal orogen caused extensive intracontinental folding and thrusting that resulted in a depositional hiatus in the Late Jurassic , as well as crustal anatexis that generated syn-kinematic granites , adakites and migmatites. The lithosphere of the East Asian continent was thickened, reaching a maximum during the latest Jurassic or the earliest Cretaceous. In the second stage (ca. 135–120 Ma), delamination of the thickened lithosphere resulted in a remarkable (&gt;120 km) lithospheric thinning and the development of mantle-derived magmatism, mineralization , metamorphic core complexes and rift basins. The Middle Jurassic–Early Cretaceous subduction of oceanic plates (paleo-Pacific, meso-Tethys, and Mongol–Okhotsk) and continent–continent collision (e.g. Lhasa and Qiangtang) along the East Asian continental margins produced broad coastal and intracontinental orogens. These significant tectonic activities, marked by widespread intracontinental orogeny and continental reconstruction, are commonly termed the Yanshan Revolution (Movement) in the Chinese literature. ]\n","732\n","iteracion 733\n","[ A review of high trophic predator-prey relationships in the pelagic Northern Humboldt system, with a focus on anchovetas ]\n","733\n","[ Highlights Peruvian anchoveta, Jumbo squid , squat lobster and mesopelagic fish are ecological important species off Peru.

The predator-prey relationships in the NHCS off Peru have been studied for almost a century - but limited to a handful of species - with new discoveries in the last decades. Here we review the literature on the diet of species within the NHCS off Peru that predate on anchoveta, jumbo squid , squat lobster and mesopelagic fish (i.e. Vinciguerria lucetia and myctophids), aiming to better understand the potential impacts on threatened, protected or data deficient species , to highlight the need for inclusion of these predators in ecological models, and to inform further actions to improve the implementation of ecosystem-based fishery management (EBFM). We also comment on the impact that the environment (e.g. ENSO) has on these interactions.

Interannual variability leads to varying trend estimates depending on the considered time span. Correction of post-glacial rebound effects on ice mass trend estimates represents no more than 8 Gt/y over the whole ice sheet. We also investigate possible climatic causes that can explain these ice mass interannual variations, as strong correlations between GRACE-based mass balance and atmosphere/ocean parallels are established: (1) changes in snow accumulation, and (2) the influence of inputs of warm ocean water that periodically accelerate the calving of glaciers in coastal regions and, feed-back effects of coastal water cooling by fresh currents from glaciers melting.

Thus there is an increasing demand on tightening the emission standards for marine diesel engines, which necessitates the research on various emission reduction strategies. This review covers emission regulations and emission factors (EFs), environmental effects and available emission reduction solutions for marine diesel engines. Not only the establishment of the emission control areas (ECAs) in the regulations but also many experiments show high concerns about the sulfur limits in fuels, sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions.

Sulfur content in fuel oil is an important parameter index that determines the development direction of emission control technologies. Despites some issues, biodiesel, methanol and liquefied nature gas (LNG) play their important roles in reducing emissions as well as in replacing fossil energy, being promising fuels for marine diesel engines. Fuel-water emulsion (FWE) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are effective treatment option for NOx emissions control. Common rail fuel injection is an effective fuel injection strategy to achieve simultaneous reductions in particulate matter (PM) and NOx.

Nowadays, they are considered a very valuable ecosystem by scientists and coastal dwellers which was once neglected. Mangroves remarkably contribute to environmental maintenance by providing various ecosystem services and livelihood to the individuals dependent on these wonders of nature. Under severe salinity stress, they tend to grow, flower, and provide support to the environment. By encompassing various physiological adaptations mangroves exhibit a wide range of survival methods, they have a well-developed mechanism for salt exclusion, ion-regulation, photosynthesis, and nutrient uptake . True mangroves also display an efficient mechanism in coping with salinity stress, leaf size, growth, biomass yield, ion regulations, and water relations exhibiting a significant role in the maintenance. Some species of mangroves are highly tolerant to salt stress and are found to exhibit better performance than less salt-tolerant ones. Mangroves also exhibit various phytochemicals and bioactive properties including pesticide activities and most of their parts can be utilized. Comparing certain physiological adaptations and biological properties exhibited by true mangroves against stress gives accountable information, thereby paving a strong foundation for future works on the “Green Lungs” of the planet. ]\n","738\n","iteracion 739\n","[ Relation of sea water to fresh water in carbonate rocks in coastal areas, with special reference to Florida, U.S.A., and Cephalonia (Kephallinia), Greece ]\n","739\n","[ The principles controlling the equilibrium between the denser salty water and the lighter fresh water in coastal aquifers apply to carbonate as well as sand systems. However, under certain equilibrium conditions of fresh and salt water in parts of some carbonate aquifers unusual hydrologic phenomena result. Hydrologic conditions at Tarpon Springs, Florida, and Cephalonia, Greece, include deep vertical openings as sinkholes through a relatively impervious part of the aquifer system. In both cases the tops of the sinkholes or natural wells are exposed to sea water. At Tarpon Springs the dynamic equilibrium between salt water and fresh water fluctuates so that the flow of salt water from the spring to a lake 2 miles away is sometimes reversed. At Cephalonia, the head of fresh water does not exceed the head of salty water in the sinkholes; the flow of sea water into the aquifer, aided by a shallow channel from the sea, is continuous, and the water level in the sinkhole is continuously depressed below sea level. Both cases represent a partially confined U-tube system where water at the seaward, sinkhole end is denser than at the other end and where a low fresh-water head is less than the salt-water head. ]\n","739\n","iteracion 740\n","[ Anthropogenic pollution of aquatic ecosystems: Emerging problems with global implications ]\n","740\n","[ Highlights Corals reefs are impacted by sewage reaching the ocean through underground aquifers.

However, anthropogenic activities increasingly provoke deleterious impacts in aquatic ecosystems. In this paper we discuss five sources of anthropogenic pollution that affect marine and freshwater ecosystems : sewage, nutrients and terrigenous materials, crude oil, heavy metals and plastics. Using specific locations as examples, we show that land-based anthropogenic activities have repercussions in freshwater and marine environments, and we detail the direct and indirect effects that these pollutants have on a range of aquatic organisms, even when the pollutant source is distant from the sink. While the issues covered here do focus on specific locations, they exemplify emerging problems that are increasingly common around the world. All these issues are in dire need of stricter environmental policies and legislations particularly for pollution at industrial levels, as well as solutions to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic pollutants and restore the important services provided by aquatic ecosystems for future generations. ]\n","740\n","iteracion 741\n","[ Marine macroalgae in a circular economy context: A comprehensive analysis focused on residual biomass ]\n","741\n","[ Highlights Marine macroalgal waste valorisation is reviewed considering a biorefinery approach. A world perspective concerning marine macroalgal waste is provided. Agricultural and feed applications are reviewed aiming the direct use of the biomass. Cascade valorisation routes are presented considering high and low value products. Valorisation routes are extensively discussed focusing on future perspectives. , The accumulation of Marine Macroalgal Waste (MMW) - drifted marine macroalgae - is a growing phenomenon. The lack of appropriate management protocols for this residual biomass leaves it mostly unmanaged or disposed of in landfills. Such inappropriate solutions lead to negative environmental impacts, health concerns and coastal degradation, representing an opportunity to develop the bioeconomy. Although a relevant number of studies exists on the use of edible marine macroalgae for several purposes, there is generally a lack of information concerning MMW valorisation, at both local and global scales. This review thus explores the ecological and biotechnological potential for the establishment of a new approach for MMW valorisation based in the circular and blue economies. It is supported in literature on the use of residual biomass whenever possible and also includes studies with fresh biomass to extrapolate, considering known characteristics of MMW; consequently, a roadmap for its utilisation is provided. The review includes characteristics of various seaweeds, MMW accumulation worldwide and traditional uses, together with the development of alternative and integrated valorisation strategies. By analysing a large number of studies, it was possible to perceive a clear potential to explore MMW to obtain renewable fuels, especially biogas and bioethanol and for use in agricultural activities. Allied to this, the extraction of value-added compounds, such as lipids, pigments, phenolic compounds and specific polysaccharides is highlighted, aiming to contribute to the development of an economically feasible zero-waste biorefinery approach. ]\n","741\n","iteracion 742\n","[ Regional similarities and differences in mature human milk fatty acids in Chinese population: A systematic review ]\n","742\n","[ Highlights We categorized regions of China to study regional differences in milk fatty acids.

We hypothesized that mature human milk fatty acid profiles differ among regions of China. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a systematic review to calculate regional average contents of fatty acids and the statistical significance of regional differences in fatty acids. We searched both Chinese and English literature databases and selected 21 articles, including 11 in Chinese and 10 in English. We categorized regions of China by 3 ways: 1) north vs. south; 2) inland vs. coastal; 3) socioeconomic development levels. The ratios of ΣSFAs:ΣMUFAs:ΣPUFAs were similar between regions and the average was 1:1:0.7. Contents of palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids were also similar between regions and together they accounted for more than 70% of all fatty acids in mature human milk.

This article starts with an introduction to the latest development in China's policies and practices in the past three decades, followed by an attempt to explore the reasons behind this haunting IUU problem. It is found that lack of concrete regulatory measures, ineffective policy implementation, and insufficient supervision and control are the main impediments to eliminate the on-going IUU problem. Therefore, the authors suggest fishery authorities in China have stronger willingness and determination to impose stricter supervision and control on DWF industry, but at the same time, gives more concern to fishermen by offering training courses to raise their awareness of law compliance and mitigate motivations to commit infraction. Only in such way would China promote healthy and sustainable development of DWF, and become a responsible major fishing nation as it aims to be. ]\n","745\n","iteracion 746\n","[ Aerosol remote sensing in polar regions ]\n","746\n","[ Multi-year sets of ground-based sun-photometer measurements conducted at 12 Arctic sites and 9 Antarctic sites were examined to determine daily mean values of aerosol optical thickness τ ( λ ) at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, from which best-fit values of Ångström's exponent α were calculated. Analysing these data, the monthly mean values of τ (0.50 μm) and α and the relative frequency histograms of the daily mean values of both parameters were determined for winter–spring and summer–autumn in the Arctic and for austral summer in Antarctica . The Arctic and Antarctic covariance plots of the seasonal median values of α versus τ (0.50 μm) showed: (i) a considerable increase in τ (0.50 μm) for the Arctic aerosol from summer to winter–spring, without marked changes in α ; and (ii) a marked increase in τ (0.50 μm) passing from the Antarctic Plateau to coastal sites, whereas α decreased considerably due to the larger fraction of sea-salt aerosol. Good agreement was found when comparing ground-based sun-photometer measurements of τ ( λ ) and α at Arctic and Antarctic coastal sites with Microtops measurements conducted during numerous AERONET/MAN cruises from 2006 to 2013 in three Arctic Ocean sectors and in coastal and off-shore regions of the Southern Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and the Antarctic Peninsula . Lidar measurements were also examined to characterise vertical profiles of the aerosol backscattering coefficient measured throughout the year at Ny-Ålesund. Satellite-based MODIS , MISR , and AATSR retrievals of τ ( λ ) over large parts of the oceanic polar regions during spring and summer were in close agreement with ship-borne and coastal ground-based sun-photometer measurements. An overview of the chemical composition of mode particles is also presented, based on in-situ measurements at Arctic and Antarctic sites. Fourteen log-normal aerosol number size-distributions were defined to represent the average features of nuclei, accumulation and coarse mode particles for Arctic haze, summer background aerosol, Asian dust and boreal forest fire smoke, and for various background austral summer aerosol types at coastal and high-altitude Antarctic sites. The main columnar aerosol optical characteristics were determined for all 14 particle modes, based on in-situ measurements of the scattering and absorption coefficients. Diurnally averaged direct aerosol-induced radiative forcing and efficiency were calculated for a set of multimodal aerosol extinction models, using various Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function models over vegetation-covered, oceanic and snow-covered surfaces. These gave a reliable measure of the pronounced effects of aerosols on the radiation balance of the surface–atmosphere system over polar regions . ]\n","746\n","iteracion 747\n","[ Modeling Pathogen Dispersal in Marine Fish and Shellfish , Modeling Pathogen Dispersal in Marine Fish and Shellfish ]\n","747\n","[ Highlights Bio-physical models are a useful tool for understanding dispersal and transmission of marine pathogens. While utilized for larval dispersal models, they are only recently being used in epidemiological studies and are currently underutilized by the marine epidemiology field. Bio-physical models are useful for spatial planning and coastal management. For example, they have been used for spatial planning of salmon farm site locations, and to establish early warning networks. Bio-physical modeling can be used to test hypotheses, rather than simply develop them. Model resolution and computation demands must be balanced when making decisions about model parameters. Epidemiological bio-physical models are in their infancy. While they have proven useful so far, future applications of these models can incorporate more aspects of disease dynamics and address many additional questions. , In marine ecosystems, oceanographic processes often govern host contacts with infectious agents. Consequently, many approaches developed to quantify pathogen dispersal in terrestrial ecosystems have limited use in the marine context. Recent applications in marine disease modeling demonstrate that physical oceanographic models coupled with biological models of infectious agents can characterize dispersal networks of pathogens in marine ecosystems. Biophysical modeling has been used over the past two decades to model larval dispersion but has only recently been utilized in marine epidemiology . In this review, we describe how biophysical models function and how they can be used to measure connectivity of infectious agents between sites, test hypotheses regarding pathogen dispersal, and quantify patterns of pathogen spread, focusing on fish and shellfish pathogens. ]\n","747\n","iteracion 748\n","[ Heavy metal, trace element and petroleum hydrocarbon pollution in the Arabian Gulf: Review ]\n","748\n","[ The Arabian Gulf environmental status was assessed based on studies conducted in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates (UAE) during 1983–2011.

Approximately 50 published studies were reviewed in order to determine the pollution status in the Arabian Gulf regarding heavy metals and organic substances. Three types of environmental pollutions including marine and coastal, soil, and air were addressed in this review as well as sources of pollutants and their effect on biological systems, marine organisms, and human health.

Due to its agrarian economy, use of fossil fuels, industries, growing population and urbanization, chemicals such as pesticides, dioxins and related chemicals (DRCs), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), heavy metals, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely spread in India. We have published a review (Subramanian and Tanabe, 2007) covering papers published until 2005, on India. A decade had passed and this is the time to provide an update of the spatial and temporal changes during this period and hence this review. At many instances organochlorines such as DDTs and HCHs showed decreasing trends even though they are still at considerable levels. Novel chemicals such as PCDDs/Fs are seen at municipal solid waste dumping sites of India at levels equivalent to similar locations of the developed world. In the e-waste processing sites in India, especially the informal ones, apart from PCDDs/Fs, some brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and heavy metals were present as contaminants. Metro cities of India showed location specific contamination by HCHs, DDTs, PCDDs/Fs, BFRs, PAHs, etc. Coastal regions of India seem to be still unpolluted when compared to the nearby inland locations. This review is concerned mainly with the chemicals that we (CMES) have been evaluating in India in the past three decades.

The parabolic bay shape equation has proven to be a convenient and practical tool for studying the stability of the headland-bay beaches, tombolos, and salients in Santa Catarina. The beaches exhibit different patterns of sediment removal as a function of the degree of beach curvature. In highly curved beaches, there is a well-developed shadow zone and a range of morphodynamic conditions, from a sheltered low-energy beach adjacent to the downdrift headland to a high-energy exposed beach on the straight end of the headland-bay beach. The less curved beaches instead, tend to show more uniform behaviour since they are directly exposed to incident waves. There is no obvious relationship between average wave height and mean grain size, showing the importance of sediment source to characterize the sedimentary distribution patterns in the study area. The analysis of beaches showed that beach morphodynamics and sequence profiles for a bay–headland coast in a microtidal east coast environment is a function of geological inheritance (e.g., distance between headlands and orientation, nearshore and inner shelf morphology, coastal plain morphology, and sediment source), and hydrodynamic factors (wave conditions, oceanic wave exposure and relative tidal range). ]\n","751\n","iteracion 752\n","[ Chapter 11 The Biology of Barramundi ( Lates calcarifer ) in the Fly River System ]\n","752\n","[ Barramundi ( Lates calcarifer ) is a large species of Centropomidae that occurs in coastal waters, estuaries , and freshwaters from western India, around Sri Lanka to the Bay of Bengal, and through the whole of Southeast Asia to Papua New Guinea and northern Australia. In New Guinea it occurs on the coast and inland in most rivers in the south of the country, with the largest populations in the Fly River. Throughout its range it supports extensive commercial, aquacultural, and recreational fisheries, and in Papua New Guinea it is the most economically important species in the artisanal fisheries of Western Province. Recent genetic research shows that, unlike the situation in northern Australia where there are multiple small genetic stocks of Barramundi, there is just one large stock of Barramundi living in the Fly River and associated coastal waters. This stock extends into Irian Jaya (West Papua), thereby constituting a cross-border resource, but differs from a small isolated stock of Barramundi found in the far east of Papua New Guinea. It has a complex life history and is a protandrous hermaphrodite (starts life as a male and changes to female). A complete reorganization of gonad structure and function takes place after sex inversion, probably under the influence of hormones. L. calcarifer spawn as males for 3–4 years before sex inversion. The fecundity of L. calcarifer is among the highest of any teleost fish, with estimates of from 0.6 to 2.3×10 6 eggs kg −1 of body weight. Large female Barramundi move to the coastal spawning grounds near Sigabaduru (west of Daru) during the late dry season (September–October) when gonad maturation takes place in estuarine waters (salinities of 28–36‰). Spawning takes place in the sea, and between October and February, as the wet season progresses, there is a tidal-based monthly cycle of spawning, with larvae moving into shallow coastal areas and backswamps shortly after hatching at around 5.0-mm long, usually on the spring high tides. Spawning at this time ensures that the juveniles can enter sheltered coastal areas, flooded backswamps, or floodplains and remain in these areas until they dry up during the early part of the dry season. They rapidly become the dominant predators of other fish larvae and crustaceans in this habitat. Juvenile Barramundi leave these habitats and disperse eastward (and westward) along the coast at about 6 months of age and at a length of about 200 mm. Some stay in coastal waters while the majority migrate into the lower Fly River and continue to move upstream , reaching the middle Fly River, the Strickland River, and Lake Murray where they grow to become adults. These adults do not, however, follow a regular annual migration to the sea as they do in Australia, and many fish only visit the sea once during their lives, with some individuals remaining upriver for extended periods. During flood periods many Barramundi move into off-river water bodies, particularly oxbow lakes , where there is an abundance of crustaceans and small fish, such as Fly River Herring ( Nematalosa spp.), that form the bulk of their diet. Barramundi have long been subjected to heavy fishing pressure, both artisanal and commercial, in the Fly River and along the coast of Western Province. Overexploitation by commercial fisheries in the 1980s is thought to have contributed to a massive decline in numbers, which is only now being reversed with the help of enlightened management regulations based upon a thorough understanding of the life cycle and biology of the species. ]\n","752\n","iteracion 753\n","[ Organic pollutants adsorbed on microplastics: Analytical methodologies and occurrence in oceans ]\n","753\n","[ Highlights Analysis and occurrence of organic pollutants adsorbed on microplastics are reviewed.

This paper proposes a case study of the mathematical models of the ocean wave imaging schemes and the Tsunami detection system model for the Japan's region where Tsunamis hits on March 11, 2011. Tsunami detection function ( q -factor) was developed which is well known as q -factor estimates. q -factor works on the principle of selected radar band threshold. The tsunami reaches around an hour afterward the earthquake, as specified through the relationship in the velocities in altered bands. These effects in a high-pitched upsurge in the q -factor, descriptive the tsunami appearance. This radar functions for only 40 min in the hour, causing in the 20 min gaps noticeable in plots. The entrance of the tsunami is specified by relationship between velocities in altered bands early about 2.5 h afterward the volcanic activity. q- factor demonstrates a sudden conversion in magnitude about 8 min afterward the start of the velocity relationships. At this point, the velocity is declining, representing that the tsunami is stirring offshore, subsequent in the negative q -factor. The future improvements in integrated tsunami detection systems can also be easily incorporated in this technique in order to obtain better detection capabilities. ]\n","757\n","iteracion 758\n","[ Architecture and agency for equity in areas beyond national jurisdiction ]\n","758\n","[ The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (Ocean Decade) bring increased attention to various aspects of ocean governance , including equity. One of the Ocean Decade's identified challenges is to develop a sustainable and equitable ocean economy, but questions arise about how to conceptualize the multiple dimensions of equity in an ocean context. These questions become more complex as activities move away from coastal ecosystems and communities into off-shore Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ), where ocean resources are recognized simultaneously as unowned/open access and as common heritage. In this paper, we mobilize the Earth System Governance analytics of ‘architecture’ and ‘agency’, to reflect on the possibilities for equity in ABNJ. Motivated by the general attention to equity in UN initiatives like the SDGs and the Ocean Decade, we describe current UN architecture for ocean governance, including principles that might support equity. Existing UN architecture focuses on distributional equity among nation states, with less attention to recognitional or procedural equity. State actors have most agency, while non-state actors can exercise some via broad UN declarations and through mechanisms like ‘major groups.’ We use on-going negotiations in the International Seabed Authority on rules for mineral exploitation and in the Intergovernmental Conference on an international legally binding instrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction to illustrate how existing architecture shapes possibilities for equity in ABNJ. As new governance possibilities are imagined, attending to existing architecture and agency can help avoid further entrenching existing power imbalances and unwittingly reproducing or exacerbating inequities. ]\n","758\n","iteracion 759\n","[ Discordant forearc deposition and volcanism preceding late-Cretaceous subduction shutdown in Marlborough, north-eastern South Island, New Zealand ]\n","759\n","[ Compression during normal continental-oceanic subduction leads to the development of a rugose subduction wedge landward of the trench within the marine forearc. Fault-bounded highs across the wedge partition clastic deposition between sub-basins, producing wide variations in sediment thickness over 10’s of kilometres. Partitioning, exacerbated by localised mass-wasting, produces forearc successions that are characterised by a broad spectrum of depositional processes and grainsizes. Second order subduction events (e.g. ridge or plateau collision) can disrupt these processes over several millions of years and elicit depositional responses that are discordant within the forearc stratigraphy. These responses thus constitute stratigraphic signals of such events, but can be difficult to decipher owing to the stratigraphic complexity and inherently destructive nature of marine forearcs. Stratigraphic interpretations for well-preserved clastic and volcanic successions in Marlborough, in New Zealand’s South Island, have long held that between 105 and 95 Ma deposition took place into a series of nascent rift basins, consistent with extension elsewhere in New Zealand. We propose a new stratigraphic framework for Marlborough for the New Zealand Urutawan-Motuan (108.4 to 99.5 Ma) and Ngaterian (99.5 to 95.2 Ma) that instead describes deposition within a coastal plain and attached marine basins during ongoing subduction of the Phoenix Plate. We posit that between 108.4 and 95.2 Ma, hiatus conditions, coarse mass-wasting (including olistostromes), prolific highstand deposition and forearc exhumation punctuated by forearc volcanism represent a significant disruption of preceding depositional patterns. The synchronicity, long-term cyclicity (1 to 5 Ma) and regional extent of these stratigraphic changes indicate that regional tectonism underpinned deposition, which we attribute to second order subduction events along the mid-Cretaceous convergent margin . The stratigraphic framework presented here is consistent with regional geochronologic, stratigraphic and plate reconstruction data that independently argue for continued Phoenix Plate subduction after 92 and as late as 86 Ma. This study underlines the complexity of plate margin dynamics and the complications produced by second order subduction events. The framework presented here indicates that subduction and continental extension were contemporaneous, which following subduction shutdown led to continental breakup from 85 Ma. A stratigraphic record of these events is preserved within the exhumed forearc in Marlborough, which continued to accumulate sediments despite the profound plate-scale events taking place below. ]\n","759\n","iteracion 760\n","[ Tidal level influence on the spawning process of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (Lamarck, 1816) on a rocky shore (Bay of Biscay) ]\n","760\n","[ Highlights Sea urchins biological differences considering tidal level.

In the Bay of Biscay, the situation is different, as some studies have been conducted on the Spanish Basque coast but few on the French part of that coast. However, the Basque coast offers favourable conditions for the development of this species, and its exploitation could be a source of potential diversification for fishermen, especially in the context of difficulties with some other resources. At the request of the managers of this coastal resource, a study was undertaken on sea urchins to improve knowledge of this stock, particularly about its biological characteristics . In this work, assessment consisted of determining the spawning process of the stock throughout the year by collecting data on sea urchin size and wet weights of the test, dry gonads and viscera . From September 2013 to September 2014, sea urchins were collected monthly at this site, from intertidal and subtidal areas, and then analysed in the laboratory. This study takes into account the tidal level in the sample design, which allows a novel highlighting of significant differences in biological characteristics between intertidal and subtidal individuals.

This review focuses on two controversial issues: (1) which one was the primary controlling factor of the Triassic geodynamic process of the South China Block (SCB), oceanic subduction or intracontinental convergence? (2) what was the subduction style of the Paleo-Pacific plate during the Jurassic–Cretaceous? Based on analyses of regional deformation and published geochronological, petrological, and Nd isotopic data of the magmatic rocks, we reconstruct the Mesozoic tectonic architecture and determined the temporal and spatial evolution of magmatic activities in the ESCB. The analysis of regional deformation shows that two groups of folds, including NE/NNE-trending folds in the Cathaysia Block and NW/NWW-trending folds in the inland, were formed in the Middle–Late Triassic. Subsequently, Middle–Late Jurassic NW–SE compression led to large-scale NE-trending fold-thrust deformation in the SCB, except for roughly S–N extension in the eastern Nanling tectonic belt, which caused the occurrence of the NE-striking dextral-normal oblique faults. Geochronological data indicate that magmatism in the ESCB can be divided into five separate stages: at 250–210 Ma, 210–170 Ma, 170–145 Ma, 145–120 Ma, and 120–85 Ma, respectively. In the first stage, granitic rocks consist mainly of S- and A-type granites, with subordinate I-type granites. These three types of granites were all derived from the partial melting of Proterozoic rocks. In the second stage, the magmatic activities are characterized by mantle-derived magmas in the coastal area, while they are featured by the mixing of predominantly mantle-derived melts with the Neoproterozoic crust in the inland area. In the third stage, widespread I- and A-type granites, which are characterized by the crust-mantle mixing, were formed in the Nanling tectonic belt and adjacent regions in response to the intense extension of lithosphere. In contrast, the development of crust-derived magmas in the Wuyi tectonic belt indicates a relatively weak lithosphere extension. The granitoids of the fourth stage, which are composed of I- and A-type granites, are mainly distributed in two separate areas, the eastern Jiangnan Orogenic Belt and southeastern Guangdong Province. Their petrogenesis is related to the crust-mantle mixing under the extensional setting. The magmatic activities in the last stage propagated eastward and were developed in the coastal area. The intrusive suites comprise major I- and A-type granitoids, and minor gabbroids, which were formed in an enhanced lithospheric extensional setting. Combined with the records of regional deformation, sedimentology, and magmatic evolution, we propose a new tectonic evolution model for the ESCB covering the range of ca. 270 Ma to 85 Ma. This model demonstrates that the ESCB probably experienced a coeval multi-plate convergence during the Triassic, producing an intracontinental deformation belt in the Yangtze Block and an Andean-type retro-arc foreland system in the Cathaysia Block. During the Jurassic–Cretaceous period, the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate beneath the SCB triggered crustal thickening, local extension, and large-scale lithospheric extension through the advance, tearing, rollback, and breakoff of the oceanic slab. ]\n","762\n","iteracion 763\n","[ Salinization in large river deltas: Drivers, impacts and socio-hydrological feedbacks ]\n","763\n","[ Highlights Deltas are fully coupled human-natural systems with multiscale drivers and feedbacks.

It is apparent that this integrated aquaculture-agriculture system is suited to environmental and hydrological conditions found in specific areas. Production strategies devised by farmers demonstrate that the diversified culture of shrimp with rice is technically feasible. Shrimp-rice agroecosystems exhibit several synergistic effects between systems components that result in efficient resource use and enhanced production, whilst avoiding negative environmental impacts. Integrated cropping enhances agrobiodiversity and reduces dependence on external inputs (agrochemicals, feed and fertiliser). Diversified shrimp-rice culture produces a valuable export crop, stimulating economic development and staple cereal, fish and vegetable crops that enhance human nutrition and food security.

They are often inhabited by aquatic vegetation, such as mangroves, sea grasses and salt marshes. Given their wide geographic distribution and coverage, there is need to prioritize conservation efforts. An understanding of the human importance of these ecosystems can help with that prioritization. Here, we summarize a literature review of ecosystem service valuation studies.

Although bauxite formation declined globally from the Carboniferous to the Permian in conjunction with global cooling, it was an interval of widespread bauxite formation in China. In South China, (1) the Jiujialu Formation bauxite deposits in central and northern Guizhou (Zunyi area) are of early-middle Visean age; (2) the Dazhuyaun Formation bauxite deposits in northern Guizhou (Wuchuan–Zheng'an–Daozheng area) to southern Chongqing (Nanchuan area) and southeastern Guizhou (Fuquan–Kaili area) are of Late Pennsylvanian–Early Permian age; and (3) the Heshan Formation bauxite deposits in western Guangxi to Yunnan are of Middle–Late Permian age. In North China, the Benxi Formation bauxite deposits are of Late Mississippian–Middle Pennsylvanian age. The contrasting trends in bauxite metallogenesis between China and the rest of the world imply different climatic patterns in the eastern Tethys (high annual humidity with seasonal dryness) and Pangea (aridification). This hypothesis is further supported by differences in the chemical index of alteration, or CIA (&gt;80 in the eastern Tethys vs. ~50 in western Pangea), and in paleotemperatures (mean annual temperature, or MAT = ~20 °C in the eastern Tethys vs. ~4 °C in western Pangea) determined from Permo-Carboniferous siliciclastic deposits . Permo-Carboniferous bauxite deposits in South China formed in coastal plain and coastal karstic depression environments, in which the position of the groundwater table was related to sea-level changes. During the late Paleozoic, high-frequency eustatic fluctuations caused by waxing and waning of Gondwana icesheets controlled sedimentation in these coastal depositional systems, leading to cyclic accumulation of coal and bauxite deposits and cycles of vadose- and phreatic-type bauxite formation. The results of the present study show that, during interglacial stages, lateritization resulted from high p CO 2 , high sea-level and groundwater-table elevations, low precipitation, and limited vegetation cover, whereas during glacial stages, bauxitization of these ferralitic weathering products was promoted by low p CO 2 , low sea-level and groundwater-table elevations, high precipitation, and more extensive vegetation cover. Thus, a unique combination of geographic, climatic, and eustatic factors accounted for widespread formation of bauxite in South China during the LPIA. ]\n","769\n","iteracion 770\n","[ Nature-based solutions efficiency evaluation against natural hazards: Modelling methods, advantages and limitations ]\n","770\n","[ Highlights There are no holistic models that integrate the functions, benefits and costs of NBS. Numerical models with some improvements are promising for NBS efficiency evaluation. Data intense and computational difficulties are the key cons of numerical models. Cost–benefit/multicriteria decision analysis methods are used to monetise NBS projects. The existing numerical models are lacking modules to optimise different NBS measures. , Nature-based solutions (NBS) for hydro-meteorological risks (HMRs) reduction and management are becoming increasingly popular, but challenges such as the lack of well-recognised standard methodologies to evaluate their performance and upscale their implementation remain. We systematically evaluate the current state-of-the art on the models and tools that are utilised for the optimum allocation, design and efficiency evaluation of NBS for five HMRs (flooding, droughts, heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion). We found that methods to assess the complex issue of NBS efficiency and cost-benefits analysis are still in the development stage and they have only been implemented through the methodologies developed for other purposes such as fluid dynamics models in micro and catchment scale contexts. Of the reviewed numerical models and tools MIKE-SHE, SWMM (for floods), ParFlow-TREES, ACRU , SIMGRO (for droughts), WRF, ENVI-met (for heatwaves), FUNWAVE-TVD, BROOK90 (for landslides), TELEMAC and ADCIRC (for storm surges) are more flexible to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of specific NBS such as wetlands , ponds, trees, parks, grass, green roof/walls, tree roots, vegetations, coral reefs, mangroves , sea grasses , oyster reefs, sea salt marshes, sandy beaches and dunes . We conclude that the models and tools that are capable of assessing the multiple benefits, particularly the performance and cost-effectiveness of NBS for HMR reduction and management are not readily available. Thus, our synthesis of modelling methods can facilitate their selection that can maximise opportunities and refute the current political hesitation of NBS deployment compared with grey solutions for HMR management but also for the provision of a wide range of social and economic co-benefits. However, there is still a need for bespoke modelling tools that can holistically assess the various components of NBS from an HMR reduction and management perspective. Such tools can facilitate impact assessment modelling under different NBS scenarios to build a solid evidence base for upscaling and replicating the implementation of NBS. ]\n","770\n","iteracion 771\n","[ Alteration of host-pathogen interactions in the wake of climate change – Increasing risk for shellfish associated infections? ]\n","771\n","[ The potential for climate-related spread of infectious diseases through marine systems has been highlighted in several reports. With this review we want to draw attention to less recognized mechanisms behind vector-borne transmission pathways to humans. We have focused on how the immune systems of edible marine shellfish, the blue mussels and Norway lobsters, are affected by climate related environmental stressors. Future ocean acidification (OA) and warming due to climate change constitute a gradually increasing persistent stress with negative trade-off for many organisms. In addition, the stress of recurrent hypoxia, inducing high levels of bioavailable manganese (Mn) is likely to increase in line with climate change. We summarized that OA, hypoxia and elevated levels of Mn did have an overall negative effect on immunity, in some cases also with synergistic effects. On the other hand, moderate increase in temperature seems to have a stimulating effect on antimicrobial activity and may in a future warming scenario counteract the negative effects. However, rising sea surface temperature and climate events causing high land run-off promote the abundance of naturally occurring pathogenic Vibrio and will in addition, bring enteric pathogens which are circulating in society into coastal waters. Moreover, the observed impairments of the immune defense enhance the persistence and occurrence of pathogens in shellfish. This may increase the risk for direct transmission of pathogens to consumers. It is thus essential that in the wake of climate change, sanitary control of coastal waters and seafood must recognize and adapt to the expected alteration of host-pathogen interactions. ]\n","771\n","iteracion 772\n","[ Chapter Five Modern Environment and Its Record in Surface Sediments ]\n","772\n","[ Publisher This chapter reviews the data on clay minerals, bulk (light) minerals, and heavy minerals of surface sediments from the marginal seas and the adjacent central Arctic Ocean .

Identifying the synoptic patterns that produce extreme waves is necessary to understand the wave climate for a specific location. Thus, a characterization of these weather patterns may allow the study of the relationships between the magnitude and occurrence of extreme wave events and the climate system. The aim of this paper is to analyze the interannual variability of extreme wave heights. For this purpose, we present a methodological framework and its application to an area over the North East (NE) Atlantic Ocean. The climatology in the NE Atlantic is analyzed using the self-organizing maps (SOMs). The application of this clustering technique to monthly mean sea level pressure fields provides a continuum of synoptic categorizations compared with discrete realizations produced through most traditional methods. The extreme wave climate has been analyzed by means of monthly maxima of the significant wave height (SWH) in several locations over the NE Atlantic. A statistical approach based on a time-dependent generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution has been applied. The seasonal variation was characterized and, afterwards, the interannual variability was studied throughout regional pressure patterns. The anomalies of the 50-year return level estimates of SWH, due to interannual variability have been projected into the weather types of SOM. It provides a comprehensive visual representation, which relates the weather type with the positive or negative contribution to extreme waves over the selected locations. ]\n","773\n","iteracion 774\n","[ Public health risks associated with chronic, low-level domoic acid exposure: A review of the evidence ]\n","774\n","[ Domoic acid (DA), the causative agent for the human syndrome Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP), is a potent, naturally occurring neurotoxin produced by common marine algae .

It presents desirable characteristics for biomonitoring, including being sessile, widely distributed and abundant, and is a filter-feeder able to accumulate several classes of pollutants (e.g., metals, hydrocarbons, among others). Mussels’ biological responses to pollution exposure can be measured as biomarkers, which include alterations ranging from molecular to physiological levels, to estimate the degree of environmental contamination and its effects on biota. This full review compiles two decades (2000–2020) of literature concerning biological effects on P. perna mussel caused by environmental pollutants (i.e., metals, hydrocarbons, and emerging pollutants), considering environmental and farm-based biomonitoring. Biochemical markers related to mussels’ oxidative status were efficient for the biomonitoring of metals (i.e., antioxidant enzymes associated with oxidative damage in biomolecules). Genotoxicity and cytotoxicity indicators (i.e., comet, micronucleus, and neutral red assays) provided a depiction of hydrocarbon contamination. The neutral red assay gave a time-concentration cytotoxic response to a wide range of pollutants, including emerging pollutants (e.g., pharmaceuticals and biocides) and hydrocarbons. Perna perna hemocyte parameters provided a useful approach for biocide biomonitoring. This paper summarizes useful biomarkers from molecular to physiological levels in this mussel species used to identify and quantify the degree of coastal pollution. An integrated biomarker analysis may provide a way to overcome possible biomarker variations and assess multi-polluted sites. Nevertheless, it is necessary to investigate biomarker variations according to natural factors (e.g., season and gonad maturation stage) to standardize them for trustworthy biomonitoring. ]\n","777\n","iteracion 778\n","[ Aeolian beach ridges and their significance for climate and sea level: Concept and insight from the Levant coast (East Mediterranean) ]\n","778\n","[ Relict beach ridges of aeolian origin and associated soils are often used for inferring relative sea level and climate with contrasting results. Most studies link the aeolian coastal deposits to regressive phases, some to high sea-level stands, and a few to intermediate relative sea-level positions. We interpret the apparent contradictions as indicating the lack of an over-arching concept and the inconsistent usage of sea level-related terms. In this paper we present an integrated morpho-sedimentological concept for a microtidal, mid-latitudinal coast and review existing data from the Levant (East Mediterranean) coast to evaluate the concept and to eliminate nomenclatural confusion. A coastal depositional environment in a semi-arid environment consists of shallow-marine, aeolian and alluvial facies which together form an aeolian beach-ridge complex as a package of strata which respond simultaneously to sea-level change. A transgressive complex forms through reworking or overstepping of the coastal foredune and a regressive complex forms by downstepping. Under transgression the aeolian beach ridge represents the highstand deposit and its adjacent shallow marine sediment is the transgressive deposit. Under regression the complex represents the falling stage and the associated downdip surface marks the lowstand . On the Levant coast we find chronologically well-constrained, offlapping aeolian beach ridges as parts of six downstepping beach ridge complexes formed between ~ 200 ka and 10 ka. The complexes represent the falling stage systems tract (FSST) of a short-lived (5th-order) depositional sequence when the shoreline shifted from a position close to the modern coastline to the shelf or below the shelf edge. Three of these FSSTs and their up dip and down dip super bounding surface together form the 4th order (~ 100 ka) sequence of the last interglacial/glacial cycle. The absence of transgressive, highstand and lowstand systems tract is explained by the poor preservation potential due to the small sediment budget of the complex. The falling stage complex has a high preservation potential because sediment source area increases while the sand drift potential remains above the local threshold. On the Levant coast, sand delivery to the backshore continued during relative sea-level falls for distances of up to 10 km between dune and coastline which is unprecedented in most modern analogues. The significance of the dune–soil succession for climate is limited because the dunes are governed by relative sea-level change; the vegetation response to changes in precipitation is non-linear and the dune dynamics are characterised by low resilience and hysteresis . ]\n","778\n","iteracion 779\n","[ Access to marine ecosystems services: Inequalities in Scotland's young people ]\n","779\n","[ Highlights Examines the extent young people in Scotland benefit from marine ecosystem services. Data from the annual Young People in Scotland Survey. Regular access to seafood low and show significant levels of inequalities in access. Access to marine recreational relatively high and shows no sign of inequalities. Significant difference in gender - females less likely to want or consume seafood. , The marine environment provides a wealth of goods and services from which people obtain value, but how young people interact with the marine environment and enjoy its services is an understudied area. This paper examines the extent to which young people (11–16 year olds) in Scotland benefit from marine ecosystem services in the form of seafood consumption and marine recreational activities. It uses data from the annual Young People in Scotland Survey 2016 and analyses inequality using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). Results show that regular access to seafood provisioning services from the marine environment is low with only 37% of the young people having consumed seafood in the last week, and 9.3% having never tried any type of seafood. Whitefish was the most consumed species by 68% of pupils followed by salmon by 61%. Analysis of the distribution of seafood consumption by the SIMD, shows significant levels of inequalities, with young people from more deprived areas less likely to consume a range of seafood compared to those from the less deprived areas. Access to the marine environment for recreational activities is relatively high for those activities covered by the survey - 76% of the young people reported having walked or run on the beach, followed by swimming in the sea at 68%. Analysis of the distribution of coastal and marine activities by the SIMD, found no sign of inequalities for five of the seven activities. Gender difference in young people access to seafood were significant, with young females much less likely to consume, or want to try seafood compared to young males. This was not the case however for marine recreational activity. In conclusion this study provides evidence of inequalities in young people's experience of seafood provisioning but not in recreational opportunities from the marine environment. What that means for their attitudes towards the marine environment are discussed, and a number of questions are posed for further research into young people's perceptions, motivations and aspirations around these behaviours.

States like Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Gujarat, and West Bengal are less studied. Studies on aquatic animals are limited and are restricted to a few regions only. Very few reports on MPs in freshwater environments appeared so far. Ecotoxicological studies of MPs are lacking. , The presence of meso, macro, and microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments has raised concerns due to their potential risks to aquatic as well as human life. Though plastics are considered to be inert in nature, MPs with toxic additives and accumulated contaminants have harmful ecological effects. Reports of absorption of MPs by internal tissues and toxicity in vital organs such as lung cells, liver, and brain cells have proved its serious health hazards. The study of plastic debris in the aquatic environment deserves special attention due to its ecotoxicological impact. This review presents a detailed account of the assessment of plastic debris in marine as well as freshwater environments . The formation of MPs and their sources, sampling, isolation, identification and characterization methods adopted, and the prevalence of MPs in aquatic life are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, the present article is a first-ever comprehensive review covering the entire of India. Our review finds that, so far, very few studies have been carried out, and there is a paucity of information, especially on the prevalence of plastic debris in the freshwater environment, fish, and other aquatic animals in India. While major studies have been done at various coastal locations in the southern part of India and a few studies in the rest of India, south-eastern states remain neglected. Toxicological studies on various life forms, including humans, are lacking. The present review also fills the gap in our knowledge of the various locations studied across India and can guide future research. ]\n","780\n","iteracion 781\n","[ Marine carbonate reservoirs formed in evaporite sequences in sedimentary basins: A review and new model of epeiric basin-scale moldic reservoirs ]\n","781\n","[ The development of evaporite–carbonate assemblages is a common sedimentary process in restricted and evaporitic marine environments. These assemblages provide important reservoir spaces for oil and gas. To establish a systematic understanding of, and scientific basis for, oil and gas exploration , this paper reviews the major genetic environments of evaporite–carbonate assemblages and associated hydrocarbon reservoirs . Based on the review, carbonate reservoir-forming marine evaporite sequence worldwide can be categorized into four major settings: marginal-marine sabkhas , marginal-marine evaporative lagoons, coastal salinas and regional evaporite basins. In addition, a new type of reservoir that developed in the Ordos Basin of China during the Ordovician greenhouse is proposed based on a synthesis of new and existing chemical and physical data. This new model is identified in the supra-salt reservoir in the fifth Member of the Middle Ordovician Majiagou Formation in the Ordos Basin and is termed an “epeiric basin-scale moldic reservoirs”. In this newly identified type of dolomite reservoir, irregular–circular moldic pores and vugs that are uniformly distributed in micritic dolomite matrix formed high-quality reservoir spaces, examples of which are rare worldwide to date. The primary evaporitic mineral in these molds is disseminated halite crystal, which formed in a restricted and evaporitic epeiric-basin environment. The selective dissolution of disseminated halite crystals and enlargement of its surrounding rocks in the upper part of the sedimentary cycle by meteoric water during late highstand system tract formed the unique distribution of halite-moldic pores and vugs. Within the evaporitic epeiric basin, high-frequency sea-level fluctuation and syngenetic exposure are also likely to have occurred, conditions that have been neglected in the classic models. Coupling of the extremely high atmospheric CO 2 content, low-amplitude location and high-frequency sea-level fluctuations during the Middle Ordovician greenhouse, together with the flat and broad restricted evaporative environment, controlled the formation of this rare end-member sedimentary assemblage and associated reservoirs. The reservoirs were developed within the sedimentary framework of the North China Platform, which was characterized by a general depression surrounded by three uplifted areas during the Middle Ordovician Majiagou period. The model characterized by epeiric basin-scale disseminated evaporites allowed the formation of reservoirs with high exploration potential. Exploration of this type of reservoir requires that attention is paid to hydrocarbon sweet spots generated by later diagenesis and to heterogeneous hydrocarbon accumulation. ]\n","781\n","iteracion 782\n","[ Hypersaline environments as natural sources of microbes with potential applications in biotechnology: The case of solar evaporation systems to produce salt in Alicante County (Spain). ]\n","782\n","[ Highlights This work highlights the relevance of hyper/saline ecosystems because they host a great microbiological diversity that is still far from being fully described and exploited.

Recent studies on the molecular adaptation and metabolism of halophiles have revealed promising biotechnological applications. Genomic, and proteomic studies are still necessary to highlight the importance of these microorganisms in the balance of the ecosystem, the interactions among them, and in the discovery of new applications. , Extremophilic microbes show a unique metabolism due to the adaptations they display to deal with extreme environmental parameters characterizing the extreme ecosystems that they inhabit (high salt concentration, high temperatures, and extreme pH values, high exposure to solar radiation etc.). Halophilic microorganisms characterised and isolated from saltmarshes, brines, salted ponds, salty lagoons etc. have recently attracted attention due to their potential biotechnological applications (as whole cells used for different purposes like wastewater treatments, or their biomolecules: enzymes, antibiotics, carotenoids, bioplastics). Alicante county (southeast of Spain) accounts for a significant number of salty environments like coastal or inland salty ponds from where sodium chloride (NaCl)is obtained, marshes, salty lagoons, etc. The best system characterised so far from a microbiological point of view is “Salinas de Santa Pola”, also termed “Salinas Bras del Port”. However, there are many other salty environments to be explored, like the natural park of Torrevieja and la Mata lagoons, salty lagoon located in Calpe city or inland salted ponds like those located in the northwest of the county.

In addition, special attention is focused on ecosystems such as the lagoons of Torrevieja or inland salt marshes as natural environments whose microbial biodiversity is worthy of being studied in search of new strains and species with the aim to analyze their potential biotechnological applications (pharmaceutical, food industry, biomedicine, etc.). ]\n","782\n","iteracion 783\n","[ Three late-Mesozoic fluorite deposit belts in southeast China and links to subduction of the (paleo-) Pacific plate ]\n","783\n","[ Rocks and ore deposits in subduction zones can provide clues to material cycling and related subduction processes. Here we demonstrate, based upon a new data compilation from more than 240 late-Mesozoic fluorite deposits in southeast China that most of them can be divided into three fluorite deposit belts (FDB) with distinct ages and orientations. The two older inland FDB with a NE-SW orientation were formed at 165–150 Ma and 150–130 Ma, respectively, whereas the younger coastal FDB, roughly perpendicular to the others, was generated at 110–70 Ma. The temporal-spatial distributions of the FDB are compatible with the subduction of the (paleo-) Pacific plate . We propose that the genesis of the earlier two inland FDB was due to northeastward slab rollback during low-angle subduction, while formation of the coastal FDB resulted mainly from high-angle northwestward hot/warm subduction. Large amounts of F, mainly derived from the decomposition of phengite (±apatite) in the subducted slabs, could be transported into the overlying crust via F-rich fluids and alkalic magmas. Subsequently, extensive crustal magmatism and fluid activities associated with subduction further concentrate F from the magmas and/or wall-rocks and facilitate fluorite mineralization. This study provides new insights into the interaction between the subducting (paleo-) Pacific plate and overlying eastern Eurasian continent in the late Mesozoic. It also highlights the potential genetic association of F transport/deposition with plate subduction that could be a common phenomenon in ancient and modern subduction zones. ]\n","783\n","iteracion 784\n","[ Using a GIS-tool to evaluate potential eelgrass reestablishment in estuaries ]\n","784\n","[ The lacking recovery of eelgrass ( Zostera marina ) has been observed in many coastal areas throughout the world. Through a strategic field project we managed to characterize and quantify the impact of new and already known stressors and their thresholds on the recovery process. The stressing mechanisms were 1) Physical stress from wave and current action 2) low sediment anchoring capacity facilitate uprooting of eelgrass seedlings; 3) benthic light intensity 4) ballistic stress from drifting macroalgae are damaging seedlings, 5) too frequent resuspension impoverishing the benthic light climate and dispersing seeds to deeper areas not sufficiently supported with light, 6) lugworms burial of seeds, and uprooting or burial of seedlings. Based on the field and supporting laboratory studies we present a GIS-tool that from data on a suite of stressors are able to predict potential areas for recovery of eelgrass by transplantation actions and seed broadcast. Input data may be field data or model simulation results. Here we have used model results. These input data were reclassified into 5 ranges, according to how much it impacted the eelgrass recovery process: 1) Optimal recovery, 2) Good recovery, 3) Threshold for recovery, 4) Poor recovery and 5) Very poor recovery. Afterward a weighed overlay function was performed, ending up with an accumulated value for stress impact on the eelgrass recovery process in all location in the Danish estuary, Odense Fjord. The GIS-tool is able to calculate and visualize areas of individual and/or multi-stress situations at specific locations. It also managed to identify potential recovery area at the present loading and after a 30% reduction of the external nitrogen loading of the system. Further validation by field activities is needed to verify the precision of the tool. ]\n","784\n","iteracion 785\n","[ What nutrient sources support anomalous growth and the recent sargassum mass stranding on Caribbean beaches?

In the western equatorial recirculation area, new nutrient sources may include Amazon River floods and hurricanes; in the eastern equatorial recirculation area, nutrient sources that could sustain the sargassum blooms include coastal upwelling and Congo River freshwater and nutrients. ]\n","785\n","iteracion 786\n","[ The KARREN and KARREN formation of bare slopes ]\n","786\n","[ The karren formation and karren features of bare slopes is studied. The occurrence of various karren features was measured on slopes with different inclination. The occurrence of various karren features on slopes has been presented according to slope inclination values. The slopes were put into slope categories and their karren features were given. Thus, the karren formation of the bare slopes of various karst types and karst features (glaciokarst, coastal karst, tropical karst, mediterranean karst, collapse dolines , gorges, caves etc.) can be described. It can be stated that on limestone with the increase of the inclination of the bearing slope, the diversity of karren features decreases and those of flow origin will be increasingly dominant. However, with the increase of slope inclination, features of flow origin will be increasingly simpler. On limestone, on slopes with a smaller dip and on slopes of less soluble rocks, the distribution of karren features of seepage origin increases. On glaciokarst, where bare slopes are widespread and of various inclination, karren are diverse and the distribution of various types is also considerable. In other karst areas, small-inclined slopes (coastal karst, tropical karst) or very large-inclined slopes (tropical karst, collapse dolines) are predominant and thus, the distribution of some karren features (e.g. rinnenkarren) is limited. The change of slope inclination may result in the change of karren formation. On glaciokarst, bare and subsoil karren formation are separated from each other, on mediterranean and tropical karst, they are less separated from each other and the latter prepares the former. On halite , the effect of slope inclination on karren formation may be modified by intensive dissolution. The karren formations of halite and tropical karst are partly similar which can be explained by intensive dissolution in both cases. ]\n","786\n","iteracion 787\n","[ A review of major and trace elements in Nile River and Western Red Sea sediments: An approach of geochemistry, pollution, and associated hazards ]\n","787\n","[ Highlights Health hazard due to the exposure to selected elements via inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact was calculated.

Microfossils , such as diatoms, incorporated into coastal stratigraphy provide some of the most detailed reconstructions of the history of earthquakes and tsunamis. We explore qualitative and quantitative techniques that employ the relation between diatoms and salinity , tidal elevation, and life form to: (1) reconstruct records of vertical land-level change associated with large earthquakes; and (2) identify anomalous sand and silt beds deposited by tsunamis. A global database shows that diatoms have been successfully employed in the reconstruction of earthquake and tsunami histories in Chile, the Indian Ocean, Japan, New Zealand, the North Sea, the Pacific Northwest of North America, and the South Pacific. We use case studies from some of these locations to highlight advancements in the field and new capabilities that diatoms have enabled. Examples from the Pacific Northwest of North America illustrate the evolution of quantitative diatom-based reconstructions of earthquake-related land-level change. In Alaska and Japan, diatoms have documented land-level changes throughout the earthquake deformation cycle, including possible preseismic land-level change signals and postseismic deformation. Diatoms helped identify coseismic uplift along the central Chile subduction zone coast, and uplift and subsidence along the Alaska–Aleutian megathrust, expanding our knowledge of the variability of slip in megathrust ruptures. In tsunami studies, diatoms help determine the provenance of anomalous sands and silts found in low-energy coastal stratigraphic sequences. In Japan, allochthonous marine and brackish diatoms within sand deposits signaled repeated marine incursions into a coastal lake, helping identify a possible predecessor to the 2011 Tohoku tsunami. In the Pacific Northwest of North America and Chile, diatoms were used to estimate tsunami run-up beyond the landward limit of tsunami sedimentation. Examples from the North Sea, Thailand, and Japan show how the fragmentation and sorting of diatom valves may provide evidence of high-energy transport during the rapid, turbulent flow of a tsunami. To conclude, we emphasize the importance of studying the modern diatom response to changes in land level and/or tsunami inundation to improve diatom-based records of prehistoric earthquakes and tsunamis. ]\n","790\n","iteracion 791\n","[ Pesticide residues in breast milk and the associated risk assessment: A review focused on China ]\n","791\n","[ Highlights Residue levels were followed the order of DDTs, HCHs&gt; ΣDrins&gt;HCB&gt;Σchlordanen.

Several other coastal polynyas around Antarctica have received limited study. Studies of benthic patterns and processes in polynyas indicate that faunal biomass, productivity, and carbon cycling are dependent on depth, season, ice cover, carbon supply, and hydrographic forcing. Polynyas generally have high primary productivity, which typically supports rich benthic communities through enhanced vertical carbon flux . Short and long-term indicators can provide a “foot print” of water column processes within polynyas, such as sediment community oxygen consumption and benthic biomass. Although zooplankton production directly influences the retentive nature of carbon in the euphotic zone , depth is the critical factor for the impact of net carbon export to the underlying benthos. We use a simple modeling exercise of two polynya case studies, the SLIP in the Arctic and RSP in the Antarctic, to evaluate export efficiency and benthic carbon cycling. Depth ultimately influences whether a polynya is a “retentive” versus “export” ecosystem, impacting the underlying benthic populations and associated carbon cycling. Defining polynyas and marginal ice zones as retentive versus export systems is potentially a powerful tool for understanding polar shelf processes, particularly when primary production is not measured simultaneously with benthic parameters. ]\n","792\n","iteracion 793\n","[ Multi-decadal variations in delta shorelines and their relationship to river sediment supply: An assessment and review ]\n","793\n","[ The inception, growth, and decline of numerous large and small river deltas on Earth have been strongly influenced by human population dynamics and interventions on catchments, notably deforestation and reforestation. Over the last half century, the effects of catchment conditions in determining fluvial sediment supply have been exacerbated or moderated by dams and reservoirs. The sediment balance of river deltas, crucial in terms of delta shoreline stability, advance or retreat, and subsidence , has, in turn, been affected by variations in fluvial sediment supply. The shoreline mobility and resulting subaerial coastal area changes of a selection of 54 of the world’s deltas was quantified over 30 years based on data culled from the literature and from satellite images. These changes were analyzed alongside fluvial sediment loads. Delta shoreline mobility in response to changing fluvial loads has been variable, reflecting the miscellaneous factors that influence the supply of sediment to deltas. 29 deltas are in overall erosion, 18 show shoreline advance, whereas seven do not show any significant change. The sediment loads received by 42 deltas diminished relative to values prior to 1970, by more than 50% for 28 of them. Ten deltas showed advance, some significantly, notwithstanding fluvial sediment load decreases exceeding 25%. Overall, with the exception of the Colorado (Tx) and the Indus, losses in subaerial coastal area have been rather low. It would appear that diminishing fluvial sediment supply, the driving force in deltaic equilibrium at a multi-decadal timescale, has not, thus far, had a significant negative impact on multi-decadal delta shoreline mobility. This is important in terms of gauging currently perceived delta vulnerability. Notwithstanding, a clear link exists between the mobility of delta shorelines and the reduction in fluvial sediment loads. Eroding deltas have been affected by a reduction that is twice as important as that of stable or advancing deltas since 1970. Dams currently in place will reduce, in the future, the sediment load to their deltas of 25 of the 54 rivers by more than 50% and 100% for 15 of them. It is important to envisage the supply of sediment to deltas less in terms of its direct role in generating accretion, and eventual delta shoreline advance, and more in terms of an agent of resilience. The reduction of fluvial sediment supply to deltas will negatively impact their resilience to other drivers in the future: anthropogenic, climate change, and sea-level rise. The variability of delta shoreline behavior in the face of changing fluvial sediment loads also calls for more in-depth studies of individual deltas in order to build up future management plans addressing vulnerability and loss of resilience to marine forcing, subsidence , and sea-level rise. ]\n","793\n","iteracion 794\n","[ Greywater treatment technologies for aquaculture safety: Review ]\n","794\n","[ This review intends to discuss on greywater treatment technologies, which are the physiochemical, biological and advanced oxidation process (AOP) treatment technologies that are used to remove organic, nutrient and surfactant pollutants in greywater.

In available observations, the effects of denitrification in water and sediment and phosphate release from sediments are minor influences on nitrate:phosphate ratios of the system, and excess phosphate in aged upwelling water is inherited from upwelling source water. Contrary to expectation and model results, the low N:P ratios do not trigger diazotrophic N 2 -fixation in the fringes of the upwelling system, possibly due to a lack of seeding populations of Trichodesmium . We also examine the flux of carbon from the sea surface to either sediment, the adjacent sub-thermocline ocean, or to regenerated nutrients and CO 2 . Observed fluxes out of the surface mixed layer are significantly below modeled fluxes, and suggest that regeneration of nutrients and CO 2 is unusually intense in the mixed layer. This contributes to very high fluxes of CO 2 from the ocean to the regional atmosphere, which is not compensated for by N 2 -fixation. Based on observations, the NBUS thus is a significant net CO 2 source (estimated at 14.8 Tg C a − 1 ), whereas the CO 2 balance is closed by N 2 -fixation in the model. Methane concentrations were low in surface waters in on-line measurements during 1 expedition, and based on these our estimate for the emission of methane for the entire Benguela system is below 0.2 Tg CH 4 a − 1 . ]\n","795\n","iteracion 796\n","[ Assessing the impact of bycatch on Ecuadorian humpback whale breeding stock: A review with management recommendations ]\n","796\n","[ The Southeastern Pacific Humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae reproduces from June to September off the coast of Ecuador where a large artisanal fisheries fleet consisting of more than 15,000 vessels operates year round. The bycatch impact on this humpback population has been overlooked. Based on the annual bycatch mortality documented in this study, about 0.53% (95% CI 0.2–1.5%) of the population might be potentially bycaught in gillnets annually. Depending on the total population numbers estimated and reported elsewhere for this stock (2917 or 6277 whales), the bycatch mortality is equivalent to 15 or 33 whales per year. A significant correlation was found between the annual bycatch rate and fishing effort for the period 2000–2009 ( r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.05). An increase in artisanal fisheries may cause drastic consequences since humpback whales as K-strategists have low birth and survival rates. Calves are probably the most threatened age class due to gillnet entanglements in proximity to coastal waters where artisanal vessels operate. The Ecuadorian breeding grounds for humpback whales migrating from Antarctica might become a hot spot for bycatch in the Southeastern Tropical Pacific, if the bycatch rate continues to increase. Urgent mitigation strategies coupled with precautionary management and conservation measures are required to protect this vulnerable stock of whales in the long term. The consequences of humpback whale bycatch off coastal Ecuador and possible solutions to mitigate the bycatch are analyzed. ]\n","796\n","iteracion 797\n","[ Potential for an underwater glider component as part of the Global Ocean Observing System ]\n","797\n","[ The contributions of autonomous underwater gliders as an observing platform in the in-situ global ocean observing system (GOOS) are investigated. The assessment is done in two ways: First, the existing in-situ observing platforms contributing to GOOS (floats, surface drifters, moorings, research/commercial ships) are characterized in terms of their current capabilities in sampling key physical and bio-geochemical oceanic processes. Next the gliders’ capabilities are evaluated in the context of key applications. This includes an evaluation of 140 references presented in the peer-reviewed literature. It is found that GOOS has adequate coverage of sampling in the open ocean for several physical processes. There is a lack of data in the present GOOS in the transition regions between the open ocean and shelf seas. However, most of the documented scientific glider applications operate in this region, suggesting that a sustained glider component in the GOOS could fill that gap. Glider data are included for routine product generation (e.g. alerts, maps). Other noteworthy process-oriented applications where gliders are important survey tools include local sampling of the (sub)mesoscale, sampling in shallow coastal areas, measurements in hazardous environments, and operational monitoring. In most cases, the glider studies address investigations and monitoring of processes across multiple disciplines, making use of the ease to implement a wide range of sensors to gliders. The maturity of glider operations, the wide range of applications that map onto growing GOOS regional needs, and the maturity of glider data flow all justify the formal implementation of gliders into the GOOS. Remaining challenges include the execution of coordinated multinational missions in a sustained mode as well as considering capacity-building aspects in glider operations as well as glider data use. ]\n","797\n","iteracion 798\n","[ Snake antivenom production in Ecuador: Poor implementation, and an unplanned cessation leads to a call for a renaissance ]\n","798\n","[ Highlights This is the first attempt to describe the current situation of anti-venom production in Ecuador. Ecuador is a country with 17.5 million people, and every year, 1,600 people are bitten by snakes. The lack of antivenom production is linked to higher hospital admissions due to snakebites in Ecuador. From 2015 to 2017, at least 42, 883 antivenom vials have been imported from Costa Rica due to the lack of local production. , Snakebite envenomation is a global health problem. This health problem asymmetrically affects rural populations in developing countries to such an extent that it recently has been listed as a priority neglected tropical disease (NTD). It is estimated that 5.4 million individuals are bitten by snakes each year, causing at least 2.7 million envenomations and more than 100,000 deaths each year. Ecuador has one of the highest snakebite envenomation incidence rates in Latin America, mostly in the coastal and Amazonian provinces. Envenomations in these regions are the result of bites primarily by species of snakes belonging to the Viperidae family. Ecuador was able to locally produce antivenoms , however serious flaws were revealed in the antivenom production process, leading to the decommissioning of the existing facility. In the interest of public health, we have summarized the political and social setbacks experienced by the antivenom serum production plant in Ecuador, while encouraging resuming local production of snake antivenom to improve the responsiveness of the already overburdened health system. ]\n","798\n","iteracion 799\n","[ Hippophaë rhamnoides L.

Occurrence and distribution of Hippohaë rhamnoides during the British Pleistocene. Paleoecological and biostratigraphical significance. , Recent palaeobotanical analyses of Middle Pleistocene fossiliferous lacustrine sediments (correlated with the late Anglian and the early Hoxnian Stages) collected from East Farm, Barnham, Suffolk, UK yielded the characteristic trichomes (scales) of Hippophaë rhamnoides L. together with its pollen grains. Trichomes are rarely recorded from British Pleistocene sediments. Published palynological data suggests that this species was present at certain times to varying degrees during the British Pleistocene epoch , first being recorded in the late Early Pleistocene (Beestonian Stage). During the Middle Pleistocene it is well represented either side of the Anglian Stage/Hoxnian Stage boundary in Britain, while there are other occurrences of lower frequency in the latter part of the Pleistocene. These considerations prompted a review of the presence of this species in the British Isles during the Pleistocene. Today, in northwest Europe Hippophaë rhamnoides L. is predominantly a coastal plant with native populations found on the eastern and south-eastern coastlines of England. Elsewhere on mainland Europe it can also be found growing in river valleys and other inland areas where suitable conditions prevail. The inland British Pleistocene records probably reflect this species exploiting favourable conditions in recently deglaciated open areas. It may be regarded as a pioneer shrub occurring early on in a vegetation succession, being out-competed by later arriving tree species because of its intolerance of shade. Warmer temperatures later in the interglacial vegetation cycle may have also contributed to its demise as the seeds need a degree of cold pre-treatment to prompt germination. ]\n","799\n","iteracion 800\n","[ Revisiting the problem of sediment motion threshold ]\n","800\n","[ Highlights Measured threshold for initial sediment motion is well below the Shields curve. The scale effects of turbulence cause the deviation between in situ measurements and flume experiments. The threshold (critical Shields parameter) is now a function of at least six variables. , The definition of the threshold of sediment motion is critical for continental shelf sediment dynamics. The work by A. Shields laid the foundation for this research direction, leading to the well-known Shields curve. Here we review the most widely used threshold curves that have followed from the original Shields curve over the last 80 years, and propose that in terms of physical processes the threshold (critical Shields parameter) is a function of at least six variables, i.e. grain Reynolds number, grain size distribution, sphericity, roundness, particle cohesiveness and the scale effects of turbulence. Identifying these key factors, we paid a special attention to the role of the scale effects of turbulence. Turbulence was thought to be a random process, but the improvement of measurement techniques revealed that it has both temporal and spatial structures: the magnitude of instantaneous velocity fluctuations varies in time and in location, which can cause the deviation between in situ measurements and flume experiments . In coastal and shelf waters, in situ measurements of tidal currents and suspended sediment concentrations have revealed that resuspension takes place even though the bed shear stress is well below the Shields curve. Further process and mechanism studies are required to improve the theoretical framework regarding the turbulence structures and their interplay with sediment threshold. The scientific problems for future studies include the establishment of laboratory experiments, in situ measurements and process-based modelling under different water depths and hydrodynamic conditions to quantify the scale effects of turbulence; the development of new observation techniques for higher resolution and for extreme environments; development of new data processing methods, including big data methods to analyse turbulence structures; and the quantification of the effects of biological contributions and non-particle components on the family of Shields curves. ]\n","800\n","iteracion 801\n","[ Timing and magnitude of Holocene sea-level changes along the middle and south Patagonian Atlantic coast derived from beach ridge systems, littoral terraces and valley-mouth terraces ]\n","801\n","[ Geomorphologic and chronostratigraphic investigations in various coastal localities along the middle and south Patagonian Atlantic coast, from Bahía Vera (44°S) in the north to San Julián (49°S) in the south, confirm a rich sequence of Holocene beach ridge systems and littoral and valley-mouth terraces. Beach ridges are present up to 10 m above current highest tide level (hTw) and date to the early mid-Holocene transgression maximum. Beach-ridge deposits represent high-energy, wave dominated coastal environments, whereas valley-mouth terraces and littoral terraces (elevations of 5.5–6.5 m above hTw) developed in wave-protected coastal environments. The surface elevation of these littoral forms suggest that the middle and south Patagonian Atlantic coast is likely undergoing a slow glacio-isostatic uplift on the order of 0.3–0.4 mm/a since the mid-Holocene. The early Holocene sea-level rise reached the modern coastline by 8100 14 C years ago (c. 8600 cal BP) at the latest. Sea level at that time was most likely near its present position. The Holocene transgression maximum lasted from 6900 to at least 6200 14 C BP (c. 7400 to 6600 cal BP), raising relative sea level to about 2 m to a maximum of 3 m above the present level, after which sea level declined to the present level. Two significant sea-level falls of at most 1 m occurred: a) between 6200 and 6000 14 C BP (c. 6600 to 6400 cal BP), and b) between 2600 and 2400 14 C BP (c. 2300 to 2050 cal BP). We assume, that both significant sea-level falls were predominantly driven by eustatic changes of ocean volume, whereas both thermo-steric changes and changes of tides may also have contributed to these relatively strong sea-level drops. Gravitational changes driven by Greenland ice growth ( sensu Mitrovica et al., 2001) may also have amplified any eustatic portion of sea-level fall. The trend of a general sea-level decline since the mid-Holocene transgression maximum seems to be predominantly glacio-isostatically driven. ]\n","801\n","iteracion 802\n","[ Holocene aeolian dunes in the National and Natural Parks of Doñana (SW Iberia): Mapping, geomorphology, genesis and chronology ]\n","802\n","[ Highlights Cartographies and characterization of the dune systems of the Doñana National Park Correlations of these dunes with Southwest Europe and global climatic events Millennial and centennial cycles obtained from the chronologies of the dune subsystems Seismicity and Neotectonics, genesis of the great dune complex of Asperillo, Doñana , The dune fields of the National and Natural Parks of Doñana are considered one of the most outstanding dune fields in Western Europe. They are located at the west margin of the Guadalquivir river estuary . The accumulation of aeolian sands partly blocks the connection between the ample Guadalquivir River estuary and the Gulf of Cádiz in the Atlantic Ocean. The sand units form a large oval dome, the “Abalario Dome” which connects with the large Doñana Spit Bar where dune systems accumulated as well, at least in part coevally with the spit growth. The most frequent dune morphologies are parabolic or transverse. The degree of activity was classified as stable, semi-active and active. Most stable dunes concentrate on the Abalario Dome, whereas active dunes occur mainly on the Doñana spit bar. Relative chronology was established from the superposition of dune Systems and Subsystems deduced from photogeology coupled with field surveys, orthophotos , and oblique and 3D images. Sampling and radiogenic dating (Optically Stimulated Luminescence-OSL) allowed to date eight dune Systems named as Systems I to VII plus an additional CS, which is a laterally equivalent to part of S IV, V and VI. The proposed ages are: System I, age 11.1 38 to 9.5 ky BP, perhaps extending to 8.5 ky BP. System II, 8.2 to 6.1 ky BP. System III, 5.9 to 2.6 ky BP. 39 System IV, 2.6 to 1.6 ky BP.

Additionally, it was concluded that genesis of the somewhat-different Complex System (CS) was related to the increased accumulation space created by movements (sliding) along the Mazagón and Torre del Loro faults following major regional seismic activity. ]\n","802\n","iteracion 803\n","[ Passive remote sensing technology for mapping bull kelp ( Nereocystis luetkeana): A review of techniques and regional case study ]\n","803\n","[ The distribution and abundance of the canopy-forming kelp Nereocystis luetkeana is of increasing concern for environmental management and conservation in coastal regions due to its importance as a foundation species.

It has experienced fast development and brought amount of benefits into our daily life, industry and agriculture. The main risks for the further penetration of such autonomous and decentralized desalination systems are the intermittent and fluctuating nature of the wind power resource. They can potentially result in a series of problems, including negative effects on the membrane performance , the component service duration, and complexity of the plant configuration, operation and control. To avoid or alleviate these effects, the efforts about solution strategies have been developed and mainly divided into three categories. The first category is the energy storage trying to maintain a constant operation condition for the RO unit. The energy storage carriers include batteries, supercapacitors , hydrogen, flywheel , pumped water, compressed air, and their combinations. The second category is the hybrid energy system . In a hybrid energy system, wind energy combined with other forms of energy such as solar PV, diesel, gravitational potential energy is employed as the energy supply. The third category is adjusting operating conditions of RO process and matching the RO capacity with transient energy supply, to make the process be adaptable with the wind power variation.

The withdrawal of glacier ice exposes landscapes that are in an unstable or metastable state , and consequently liable to modification, erosion and sediment release at rates greatly exceeding background denudation rates. This paper (1) reviews research on paraglacial processes, landforms and landscape change in a range of geomorphological settings; (2) explores the importance of paraglacial landscape modification and sediment recycling as a component of alternating glacial/nonglacial landscape evolution ; (3) assesses the nature and significance of paraglacial facies in Quaternary stratigraphic sequences; and (4) develops a general model of the sequence of paraglacial landscape modification and the changing nature of paraglacial landsystems. Six paraglacial landsystems are identified: rock slopes, drift-mantled slopes, glacier forelands, and alluvial, lacustrine and coastal systems. Each contains a wide range of paraglacial landforms and sediment facies. Collectively these landforms and sediments (e.g. talus accumulations, debris cones, alluvial fans, valley fills, deltas and coastal barrier structures) can be conceptualised as storage components of an interrupted sediment cascade with four primary sources (rockwalls, drift-mantled slopes, valley-floor glacigenic deposits and coastal glacigenic deposits) and four terminal sediment sinks (alluvial valley-fill deposits, lacustrine deposits , coastal/nearshore deposits and shelf/offshore deposits). Paraglacial sediment stores and sinks may form major sources of readily erodible sediment during the early stages of glacial cycles, leading to high rates of sediment transport during periods of glacier or ice-sheet expansion. Probably because of the limited preservation potential of paraglacial sediments that were subsequently over-run by glacier ice, identification of paraglacial facies in both terrestrial and marine settings has been almost exclusively limited to sequences that post-date the Last Glacial Maximum . The unifying concept of paraglacial geomorphology is that of glacially conditioned sediment availability. Relaxation of landscape elements to nonglacial conditions operates over timescales of 10 1 –&gt;10 4 years, and is conditioned by both process and spatial scale. Rate of sediment reworking can be described by an exhaustion model. In the case of primary reworking of glacigenic sediment, the rate of reworking declines approximately exponentially through time, though extrinsic perturbation may rejuvenate paraglacial sediment flux long after termination of the initial period of paraglacial adjustment. Landscape-scale (particularly alluvial and coastal) systems may exhibit intrinsically complex responses due to reworking of secondary paraglacial sediment stores. The long relaxation time of such systems implies that many areas deglaciated in the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene have still not fully adjusted (in terms of sediment supply) to nonglacial conditions. ]\n","805\n","iteracion 806\n","[ Application of numerical wave models at European coastlines: A review ]\n","806\n","[ Highlights Present a detail review of studies for wave power in Europe.

In three stratigraphic sections studied in the coastal area of the Yucatan Peninsula and the island of Cozumel, multiple levels of calcretes and palustrine carbonates were identified. The presence of these continental carbonates combined with calcarenites suggests a transition from a shallow marine deposit to a continental environment for paleosol development. This research analyzes the geochemical (δ 13 C and δ 18 O), mineralogical and micromorphological characteristics of the calcarenite , palustrine carbonate and calcretes to infer their paleoenvironmental formation conditions. The mineralogy of the samples consists entirely of aragonite and calcite . The micromorphology allowed us to identify α-calcretes and β-calcretes, as well as palustrine carbonates such as peloidal and mottled limestones. The isotopic signature of Palustrine carbonate has an intermediate isotopic signature (δ 13 C mean value of −5.24‰, δ 18 O mean value of −4.9‰), falling between that of calcarenites and calcretes. The δ 13 C (ranging from −10.10 to −7.50‰) and δ 18 O (−5.63 to −4.64‰) values of all calcretes analyzed in this work are similar to the values reported for the Pleistocene and Holocene calcretes exposed in the Caribbean Sea region. Isotopic values of δ 13 C in the studied sections are interpreted as the result of a change in vegetation from a predominant C3 vegetation associated with a cool-wet climate to a C3/C4 mixed vegetation, which is a plant cover that grows in a drier-hotter climate. ]\n","807\n","iteracion 808\n","[ Latest Pleistocene to Holocene hydroclimates from Lake Elsinore, California ]\n","808\n","[ The hydroclimate of the southwestern United States (US) region changed abruptly during the latest Pleistocene as the continental ice sheets over North America retreated from their most southerly extent.

The sediment core recovered from Lake Elsinore provides a continuous sequence with multi-decadal resolution spanning 19–9 ka BP. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses reveal hydrologic variability. In particular, sand and carbonate components indicate abrupt changes at the Oldest Dryas (OD), Bølling–Allerød (BA), and Younger Dryas (YD) transitions, consistent with the timing in Greenland. Hydrogen isotope analyses of the C 28 n -alkanoic acids from plant leaf waxes ( δ D wax ) reveal a long term trend toward less negative values across 19−9 ka BP. δ D wax values during the OD suggest a North Pacific moisture source for precipitation, consistent with the dipping westerlies hypothesis. We find no isotopic evidence for the North American Monsoon reaching as far west as Lake Elsinore; therefore, we infer that wet/dry changes in the coastal southwest were expressed through winter-season precipitation, consistent with modern climatology . Comparing Lake Elsinore to other southwest records (notably Cave of Bells and Fort Stanton) we find coincident timing of the major transitions (OD to BA, BA to YD) and hydrologic responses during the OD and BA. The hydrologic response, however, varied during the YD consistent with a dipole between the coastal and interior southwest. The coherent pattern of hydrologic responses across the interior southwest US and northwest Mexico during the OD (wet), the BA (drier), and YD (wet) follows changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, presumably via its combined influence on North Pacific winter storm tracks and the extent/magnitude of the North American Monsoon . In contrast, Lake Elsinore and the coastal southwest experiences a deglacial drying trend punctuated by abrupt change at the OD to BA and BA to YD transitions. This trend tracks rising greenhouse gases through the deglacial, with an apparent southward shift in westerly moisture sources adjusting to the retreating ice sheet. ]\n","808\n","iteracion 809\n","[ A comprehensive review on micro-plastic pollution in African aquatic systems , Erratum regarding missing Declaration of Competing Interest statements in previously published articles , Corrigendum to “Comprehensive review on microplastic pollution in African aquatic environments” [Environmental Advances Volume 5, October 2021, 100107] ]\n","809\n","[ Highlights Micro-plastics are ubiquitous in African aquatic environments .

This species has frequently bloomed in China, causing great financial losses (more than 2 billion yuan, Fujian Province, 2012). K. mikimotoi can adapt to various light, temperature, salinity, and nutrient conditions, which together with its complex life history, strong motility, and density-dependent allelopathy , allows it to form blooms that are lethal to almost all marine organisms. However, its toxicity differs between subspecies and some target-species-specific toxicity has also been recorded.

We compare boulder deposits created by two modern tsunami events, the 2004 Indian Ocean and the 2009 South Pacific tsunamis, where the boulder sources were in similar topographic settings, and for which we have accurate data on the wave characteristics. Boulder distribution, preferential orientation and numerical simulation of boulder transport are discussed. A comparison between the impacts of the South Pacific and Indian Ocean tsunamis shows similar characteristics, such as limited landward extent and the absence of landward fining. Differences between the results from modelling and field data are most probably caused by variables such as coastal plain roughness (buildings, trees), microtopography , particle shape, and boulder collision during transport that are summarised as coefficients in the mathematical models. Characterising modern events through coarse sediment deposits provides valuable information to help identify and interpret palaeo-tsunami imprints on coastal landscapes. ]\n","814\n","iteracion 815\n","[ Numerical modeling of the Amazon River plume ]\n","815\n","[ Marine circulation above the northern Brazilian continental shelf is subject to energetic forcing factors of various origins: high water buoyancy fluxes induced by the Amazon River freshwater discharge, a strong coastal current associated with a mesoscale current (North Brazil Current (NBC)), a forcing by semidiurnal tide and by Northeast or Southeast trade winds according to the season. Using a three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic numerical model (MOBEEHDYCS), and realistic bathymetry and coastline of the northern Brazilian shelf, this paper aims at studying the influence of some specific physical processes on the morphology of the Amazon plume. The very large volume discharge (180 000 m 3 /s on average) and the weak effect of Coriolis force are additional characteristics of the studied system, which induce a particular dynamics. The various forcing factors are successively introduced into the model in order to simulate and to determine their respective influences upon the plume extent and the hydrodynamics at the shelf scale. Simulation reveal that the coastal current is at the origin of the permanent northwestward Amazon plume extension while wind effect can either reinforce or moderate this situation. The tide intervenes also to modify the position of the salinity front: a horizontal migration of salinity front is observed under its action. ]\n","815\n","iteracion 816\n","[ Tsunami evacuation processes based on human behaviour in past earthquakes and tsunamis: A literature review ]\n","816\n","[ Understanding the evacuation behaviour in tsunamis offers important knowledge to consider for evacuation, countermeasures and preparedness for future tsunamis. With this background, various aspects of evacuation behaviour have been investigated in past earthquake and tsunami events, but have not been organised to provide an overview of the general tsunami evacuation process. In this paper, we reviewed 39 reports and articles that surveyed actual human responses in past 22 tsunami-related events and organised the existing findings on human behaviour during tsunamis into a theoretical framework: a tsunami evacuation process that describes general human behavioural components and notifications during tsunami events. The framework illustrates the continuous psychological and physical process in tsunami evacuation and the dynamical transition of notifications during tsunamis. Since the tsunami evacuation process provides a clear overview of the components of the tsunami evacuation process, it enables researchers design survey questions for comprehensive investigations of tsunami evacuations and leads a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of human behaviour in tsunamis that will contribute to consider more appropriate evacuation preparedness for future tsunamis. ]\n","816\n","iteracion 817\n","[ The three ‘B’ of fish mercury in China: Bioaccumulation, biodynamics and biotransformation ]\n","817\n","[ Highlights A comprehensive review of mercury levels in freshwater and marine fish from China over the past 10 years. Hg in fish is generally accumulated at a low level, but significant geographical differences were evident. Diet and growth are important factors affecting the Hg levels of fish in China. Hg biotransformation can also make contributions to Hg speciation and overall accumulation in fish. , Mercury (Hg) is a global toxic pollutant and has raised the world's attention for decades. In this study, we reviewed the fish mercury levels in China (both marine and freshwater, as well as wild and farmed) documented over the past decade and their controlling environmental and biological factors. China is the largest contributor of global Hg cycling and the largest nation for the consumption and export of fish and fish product, thus Hg level in fish becomes a critical issue for food safety and public health. In China, Hg in fish is generally accumulated at a low level, but significant geographical differences were evident and formed the “hot spots” from the north to the south. For marine fish, the east (median: 70 ng g −1 ww, range: 5.0–330 ng g −1 ww) and southeast (median: 72 ng g −1 ww, range: 0.3–329 ng g −1 ww) of China have higher total Hg concentrations than the other coastal areas. For freshwater fish, Tibetan Plateau exhibited the highest total Hg levels (median: 104 ng g −1 ww, range: 5.0–868 ng g −1 ww). Risk assessment of the exposure of low-Hg-level fish to China's population deserves more attention and detailed fish consumption advisories to specific populations are urgently needed. The biokinetic model is a useful tool to characterize the underlying processes involved in Hg accumulation by fish. The diet (Hg concentration, speciation, food quality and quantity) and growth appear to be the important factors affecting the Hg levels of fish in China. The Hg biotransformation can also make contributions to Hg speciation and overall accumulation in fish. The intestinal microbes play an important role in Hg biotransformation and the potential for minimizing Hg contamination in fish deserves further investigation. ]\n","817\n","iteracion 818\n","[ Review of valuation methods for mangrove ecosystem services ]\n","818\n","[ The goods and services provided by natural ecosystems contribute to human well being, both directly and indirectly.

Silicate levels as low as 0.2 μM were observed in coastal waters, suggesting that diatom growth may have been nutrient limited both in 1998 and 1999. Detailed sampling off the southern coast of British Columbia revealed that 1998 nitrate levels were only half the average of that during the 1970s winter, were depleted 1 month earlier in spring and remained low throughout the summer. Satellite images show that, compared to 1997 and 1999, chlorophyll levels were much lower in the spring of 1998 throughout the coastal waters of the Gulf of Alaska.

Extant species of marine turtles probably arose during the mid–late Jurassic period (180–150 Mya) so have survived past shifts in climate, including glacial periods and warm events and therefore have some capacity for adaptation. The present-day rates of increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and associated temperature changes, are very rapid; the capacity of marine turtles to adapt to this rapid change may be compromised by their relatively long generation times. We consider the evidence and likely consequences of present-day trends of climate change on marine turtles. Impacts are likely to be complex and may be positive as well as negative. For example, rising sea levels and increased storm intensity will negatively impact turtle nesting beaches; however, extreme storms can also lead to coastal accretion. Alteration of wind patterns and ocean currents will have implications for juveniles and adults in the open ocean. Warming temperatures are likely to impact directly all turtle life stages, such as the sex determination of embryos in the nest and growth rates. Warming of 2 °C could potentially result in a large shift in sex ratios towards females at many rookeries, although some populations may be resilient to warming if female biases remain within levels where population success is not impaired. Indirectly, climate change is likely to impact turtles through changes in food availability. The highly migratory nature of turtles and their ability to move considerable distances in short periods of time should increase their resilience to climate change. However, any such resilience of marine turtles to climate change is likely to be severely compromised by other anthropogenic influences. Development of coastlines may threaten nesting beaches and reproductive success, and pollution and eutrophication is threatening important coastal foraging habitats for turtles worldwide. Exploitation and bycatch in other fisheries has seriously reduced marine turtle populations. The synergistic effects of other human-induced stressors may seriously reduce the capacity of some turtle populations to adapt to the current rates of climate change. Conservation recommendations to increase the capacity of marine turtle populations to adapt to climate change include increasing population resilience, for example by the use of turtle exclusion devices in fisheries, protection of nesting beaches from the viewpoints of both conservation and coastal management, and increased international conservation efforts to protect turtles in regions where there is high unregulated or illegal fisheries (including turtle harvesting). Increasing research efforts on the critical knowledge gaps of processes influencing population numbers, such as identifying ocean foraging hotspots or the processes that underlie the initiation of nesting migrations and selection of breeding areas, will inform adaptive management in a changing climate. ]\n","821\n","iteracion 822\n","[ A fine kettle of fish: the fishing industry and environmental impacts ]\n","822\n","[ Highlights Most fishing stocks are still being exploited above sustainable levels. Oceans are acting as sinks for numerous human-generated environmental hazards. Nutrient loading or microplastics are direct threats to the quality of fish stocks. Climate change is rapidly changing ecological dynamics in world oceans. Adaptive management is needed to meet seafood demand and global food security. , Overexploitation or full exploitation of fishing stocks first became an important problem in the second half of the 20th century, with certain fisheries collapsing and others being exploited in an unsustainable manner. This situation led to dwindling fish landings worldwide, although final seafood demand has not suffered this decrease thanks to the growth of aquaculture . Currently, new threats to marine biota are emerging that could ultimately lead to further stress on fishing stocks. The current opinion article explores these growing threats, which include the spread of dead zones throughout coastal areas, marine litter, especially microplastics and nanoplastics that are ingested by marine organisms and ultimately by humans, or the effects of climate change on world oceans, including acidification due to carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere or alteration in ocean circulation due to melting glaciers. Consequently, it is critical for stakeholders in the fishing sector to gain awareness of what is at stake in the upcoming decades. In fact, not only will fisheries have to expand their approach from single-species stock assessment to ecosystem-based approaches but also other metrics will have to be brought forward to maintain competitiveness and minimize food security concerns. ]\n","822\n","iteracion 823\n","[ Aquaculture environment interactions: Past, present and likely future trends ]\n","823\n","[ Highlights decline of environmentally-friendly integrated agriculture-aquaculture systems promising environmentally-friendly technologies freshwater pond culture to continue global dominance call for conversion of low-yielding rice fields to fish ponds , The two-way interactions of aquaculture and the environment are diverse and complex. Three major questions are addressed: what happened in the past, what are today's trends, and what may the future hold? Traditional aquaculture is mostly environmentally compatible as it mainly uses on-farm and locally available wastes and by-products such as crop residues and animal or human manures for nutritional inputs or natural food in open water culture-based fisheries and mollusk and seaweed farming systems. Wastes, by-products and natural food were the only sources of nutritional inputs for most farmed aquatic organisms in the past before the relatively recent and increasing use of pelleted feed in modern aquaculture, leading to major environmental concerns. Environmental aspects of intensification of aquaculture and their relation to ecosystems and agro-ecosystems in inland terrestrial and aquatic, and coastal/offshore, land- and water-scapes are reviewed. Aquaculture is increasingly being adversely impacted by pollution from agricultural, domestic and industrial pollution. Environmental issues are illustrated by case studies of traditional and modern aquaculture farming practice in temperate and tropical inland and coastal areas. Promising technologies that employ the principles of traditional aquaculture to contribute to the sustainability of modern aquaculture are outlined. There does not appear to be a panacea for environmentally sustainable aquaculture on the horizon to meet the increasing demand for aquatic food. This is more likely to be met through improvements in existing technology, including combining aspects of traditional with modern practice; better management practices (BMPs); better site selection so that aquaculture remains within the carrying capacity of inland and coastal water bodies; and the most efficient use of land and water, which is more likely to be aquaculture than farming terrestrial crops in relatively poor agro-ecosystems. Inland aquaculture, especially in ponds, is likely to continue to dominate global aquatic food production. ]\n","823\n","iteracion 824\n","[ Occurrence, fate, and sorption behavior of contaminants of emerging concern to microplastics: Influence of the weathering/aging process ]\n","824\n","[ Highlights Current overview of sorption behavior of CECs to MPs was summarized.

The sources, behaviour and impacts of paint in the marine environment are reviewed. Paint particle emissions may be as high as 35% of the synthetic micro-debris input. Paint is regularly detected in sea surface trawls, sediments and animal digestive tracts. Hazardous additives in micro-paint particles render them more harmful than microplastics. , Because paint particles consist of a resin (polymer) combined with one or more additives, they bear compositional similarities with microplastics. Despite these shared characteristics, however, paint particles are often undetected, deliberately overlooked or evade classification in the pool of micro-debris (all synthetic debris of &lt; 5 mm in size), and in particular in the marine setting where an extensive body of microplastic literature exists. Accordingly, the present paper provides a critical insight into the physico-chemical properties, sources, distributions, behaviour and toxicity of paint particles in the marine environment. Paint particles contain a greater proportion of additives than plastics and, consequently, are more brittle, angular, opaque, dense, heterogeneous and layered than microplastics of equivalent dimensions. Land-based sources of paint particles, including deteriorating or disturbed coatings on roads and building, are transported to the ocean with other microplastics via urban runoff, water treatment facilities and the atmosphere. However, inputs of paint particles are enhanced significantly and more directly by the disturbance, erosion and weathering of coatings on coastal structures, boats and ships. Estimates of paint particle emissions to the marine environment vary widely, with calculated contributions to the total synthetic micro-debris input as high as 35%. Upper estimates are consistent with available (albeit limited) quantitative information on the relative abundance of paint particles amongst synthetic material captured by sea surface trawls and ingested by marine animals. Of greatest environmental concern is the high chemical toxicity of paint particles compared with similarly-sized microplastics and other synthetic debris. This results from the contemporary and historical use of high concentrations of hazardous inorganic additives in marine antifouling and land-based paints, and the relatively ready mobilisation of harmful ions, like Cu + /Cu 2+ , TBT + , Pb 2+ and CrO 4 2− , from the matrix. Recommendations arising from this review include greater use of particulate capturing devices, waste collection systems and recycling facilities during paint disturbance, raising awareness of the potential impacts of discarded paint amongst users, and alerting the microplastic community to the significance of paint particles and developing means by which they are isolated from environmental samples. ]\n","828\n","iteracion 829\n","[ On the edge: The use of infrared thermography in monitoring responses of intertidal organisms to heat stress ]\n","829\n","[ Monitoring changes in the environment and the corresponding effects on biological systems still represents a major challenge in many marine and terrestrial ecological studies. Infrared thermography (IRT), and its application within the marine environment, represents an effective non-invasive tool for measuring the temperatures of organisms and their surrounding environment in situ . The use of IRT within the intertidal zone is particularly useful since habitat and organismal temperatures are highly variable across both fine spatial and temporal scales. We review the growing number of intertidal studies that utilise IRT to investigate the role of small-scale temperature variability in contributing to various demographic and ecological processes. In particular, we introduce two indicators of the thermal quality of intertidal habitats that can be readily used by ecologists but also management and conservation policy makers to assess the suitability of a given habitat for a range of species under actual and predicted climatic conditions. We also outline a range of potential applications involving IRT that have yet to be explored for monitoring coastal environments. These include combining photogrammetry , unmanned aerial vehicles and IRT to large-scale three-dimensional thermal maps of intertidal habitats. We also suggest ways in which this technology could facilitate environmental management objectives in a warming world, such as the identification and quantification of thermal refugia across various spatial and temporal scales. We affirm with previous studies that such thermal refugia are vital for the adaptation of intertidal communities to climate change and that IRT could facilitate more effective management and conservation of these areas. The IRT applications outlined in this review are by no means exhaustive or limited to rocky intertidal environments. We envision that IRT will become increasingly popular as environmental management agencies become increasingly concerned about global climate change and how to combat its negative consequences on ecosystems. ]\n","829\n","iteracion 830\n","[ Ecosystem health assessment using the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica : A review ]\n","830\n","[ The endemic Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica is a key species in coastal waters and it is widely employed as an ideal biological indicator for assessing the quality of water bodies, in accordance to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), as well as for assessing the health status of coastal ecosystems.

The application of recently introduced approaches based on a set of synthetic ecological indices, namely the Conservation Index (CI), the Substitution Index (SI) and the Phase Shift Index (PSI), is also reviewed discussing their effectiveness in the context of ecosystem health assessment and of the requirements of the WFD.

In contrast to the wealth of research on hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes on sandy coasts, comparable studies on gravel beaches are few. The paucity of detailed process measurements on these beaches has been attributed to the difficulty of deploying sensitive equipment in energetic environments with mobile gravel-size clasts . Gravel beaches are, however, rather paradoxical in terms of mobility. The specific morphological features of gravel beach shorefaces, notably the lack or the poor development of a surf zone , imply a significant role by swash zone processes acting on the steep beachface, notably the control of swash asymmetry on beach gradients and in accretion or erosion phases. While swash processes are undoubtedly important in controlling the morphology of gravel beaches, the character of swash is dependent on the transformation of incident waves as they shoal, break, or surge and interact with the steep beachface. ]\n","831\n","iteracion 832\n","[ Legacy and emerging pollutants in the Gulf of Gdańsk (southern Baltic Sea) – loads and distribution revisited ]\n","832\n","[ Highlights Despite sensational media reports the Gulf of Gdańsk is not exceptionally contaminated.

Analysis of two 50 cm long sediment cores from different saltmarshes in the Santoña estuary and their comparison with previous results in nearby coastal areas defines criteria to identify records of agricultural activities in salt-marsh sediments. Agricultural occupation of saltmarshes and the later regeneration was recognised based on foraminifera and sand content. Saltmarshes in the eastern Cantabrian coast are expected to adapt to ongoing sea-level rise based on the high sedimentation rates (14–18 mm yr −1 ) observed during the regeneration process of previously reclaimed areas.

The edge cliffing, nonetheless, is also an inherent aspect of salt marsh development in many northwest European tidal marshes. Quite a few geomorphologists in the earlier half of the past century recognized such edge erosion as a definite repetitive stage within an autocyclic mode of marsh growth. A shift in research priorities during the past decades (primarily because of coastal management concerns, however) has resulted in an enhanced focus on sediment-flux measurement campaigns on salt marshes. This, somewhat “object-oriented” strategy hindered any further development of the once-established autocyclic growth concept, which virtually has gone into oblivion in recent times. This work makes an attempt to resurrect the notion of autocyclicity by employing its premises to address edge erosion in tidal marshes. Through a review of intertidal morphosedimentology the underlying framework for autocyclicity is envisaged. The phenomenon is demonstrated in the Holocene salt marsh plain of Moricambe basin in NW England that displays several distinct phases of marsh retreat in the form of abandoned clifflets. The suite of abandoned shorelines and terraces has been identified in detailed field mapping that followed analysis of topographic maps and aerial photographs. Vertical trends in marsh plain sediments are recorded in trenches for signs of past marsh front movements. The characteristic sea level history of the area offers an opportunity to differentiate the morphodynamic variability induced in the autocyclic growth of the marsh plain in scenarios of rising and falling sea level and the accompanied change in sediment budget. The ideas gathered are incorporated to construct a conceptual model that links temporal extent of marsh erosion to inner tidal flat sediment budget and sea level tendency. The review leads to recognition of the necessity of adopting an holistic approach in the morphodynamic investigations where marshes should be treated as a component within the “marsh–mudflat system” as each element apparently modulates evolution of the other, with an eventual linkage to subtidal channels. ]\n","834\n","iteracion 835\n","[ Current understanding of potential ecological risks of retinoic acids and their metabolites in aquatic environments ]\n","835\n","[ Highlights Sources of retinoic acids (RAs) and their metabolites (4-oxo-RAs) are reviewed.

Based on limited data on concentrations of RAs in freshwater ecosystems, their hazard quotients were found to range from zero to 16.41, depending on the environmental conditions of receiving waters. Ecological risks of RAs in marine environments are yet to be explored due to the paucity of data related to both their concentrations in marine environment and toxic potencies to marine species. This review updates current knowledge of RAs and 4-oxo-RAs in aquatic environments and calls for more studies on their concentrations and fate in aquatic environments, especially estuarine and coastal marine environments with a view to enabling a comprehensive assessment of their ecological risks around the globe. ]\n","835\n","iteracion 836\n","[ Living on the Margin in the Anthropocene: engagement arenas for sustainability research and action at the ocean–land interface ]\n","836\n","[ Highlights The Earth's ocean–land interface (the Margin) is critical for global sustainability .

Expanded understanding of Margin systems, resources and processes is urgently needed to enable governance for Margin sustainability. , The advent of the Anthropocene underscores the need to develop and implement transformative governance strategies that safeguard the Earth's life-support systems, most critically at the ocean–land interface — the Margin. The seaward realm of the Margin is the new frontier for resource exploitation and colonization to meet the needs of coastal nations and humanity overall.

Many of them were made extinct, probably by human hunting, around 10 000 to 14 000 BP, and the populations of the survivors were severely reduced as the Holocene progressed. Evidence is examined that such transfers were equally important among the oceans, coastal waters and inland systems as a result of the activities of anadromous fishes , marine reptiles, seabirds and marine mammals . Numbers of all of these have also been greatly reduced as a result of human activities, though largely in the past few hundred years. Their past and present status and potentialities for nutrient recycling and transfers are assessed. Large marine animals have potentially substantial top-down effects in structuring marine communities, though there is good evidence only for sea turtles and inshore habitats. There are many potential pathways for nutrient transfer, reflected in large accumulations on land of guano from seabirds. Great whales, because of their size and movement range, also offer large potentialities for transfer of nutrients across the oceans and from deep water towards the surface. However, from the very limited evidence available, it appears that the absolute global effects of these are likely to have been and to be minor. Transfers on land benefited from large nutrient supplies available in soils, from high productivity arising from light availability, from a dense and diverse mammal community and from a much smaller ratio of freshwater volume to land area. The huge volume of ocean water, its much greater mixing by wind and currents, and lower overall productivity preclude against globally significant changes in nutrient concentrations as a result of the movements of large animals, despite sometimes dramatic local effects of seabirds nesting on land and anadromous fish moving from the ocean to their freshwater spawning grounds . The intense scientific interest in these models, and the supportive vocabulary created to describe these processes, may have led to an overemphasis of their global significance. ]\n","837\n","iteracion 838\n","[ Comparison of QuikSCAT, WRF and buoy ocean surface wind data off Valparaiso Bay, Chile ]\n","838\n","[ Highlights Ocean winds were simulated with different analyses and reanalyses. WRF overestimates wind magnitude in the coastal area and underestimates it in the open sea. The model provides relatively good simulations of temporal scales greater than the diurnal. Higher horizontal resolution does not significantly improve the results of the model. The ERA-Interim-forced simulations had the best results. , The winds that affect the surface of the ocean are also important for a vast array of activities, either operational or scientific, hence the importance of being able to adequately predict this quality. Because of the preceding fact, a Weather Research and Forecasting model was used to perform simulations at the surface of the Ocean, for winds derived from different boundary conditions (NCEP-CFSR, ERA-Interim and NCEP-FNL) and configured with different spatial resolution (25, 5 and 1 km), with the objective of evaluating which of these data sets delivers the more precise wind simulation at the surface of the ocean. A comparative analysis was performed between the different outputs of the WRF model, QuikSCAT satellite and in situ observations of a buoy installed off the central coast of Chile. The results showed that the WRF model, overestimates the wind magnitudes, across all boundary conditions or spatial resolution. Additionally, depending on the in situ wind magnitude (&gt;6 ms −1 ), the model predicts adequately wind magnitude and direction. Spatial comparisons were performed between QuikSCAT and WRF outputs at the Chilean coast to evaluate any possible differences. The modeled winds showed a tendency to be stronger than those measured by Satellites and the bigger differences appeared closer to the shore. The wavelet coherence and phase analysis, confirmed that the model delivers precise wind information for frequencies greater than the daily cycle. Finally, the results of the simulation produced by the ERA-Interim analysis showed lower errors in terms of temporal and spatial variability of surface winds. ]\n","838\n","iteracion 839\n","[ Assessment and management of the North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem ]\n","839\n","[ The North Brazil Shelf is a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) that extends from the Caribbean Sea, in Central America, to the Parnaiba River in Brazil, and includes six countries. The area is dominated by the runoff of large rivers, including the Amazon and Orinoco, and by the intense disturbance of sediment transport , tides and currents. The sea bed is formed mainly by mud in shallow water, and by sand, mud, and gravel in deeper water. In terms of its biological productivity, this LME can be considered oligotrophic, with stratified habitats. The main source of nutrients of the euphotic layer is the local rivers and mangroves . Primary production has been limited by light and rising temperatures in recent years, factors associated with a decrease in marine primary productivity. However, the benthic fauna is very rich and unique, but poorly known. More than 500 fish species have been recorded in this LME. Demersal fish and shrimp are the main fishery resources in coastal and continental shelf waters. Fisheries account for more than 600 million USD a year with a considerable diversity of methods and scales ranging from very small to industrial. Seafood consumption is moderate to high in the local countries. Climate changes, dam building, deforestation, pollution, overfishing, tourism and aquaculture are the main threats to ecosystem productivity and habitat quality. Socioeconomic data are scant for this LME. Development is concentrated near the cities and mouths of rivers. Traditional communities in the coastal areas are culturally diverse, but invariably characterized by very low socioeconomic conditions . The Gross Domestic Product of the local countries ranges from 7,500 USD per capita in Guyana to 32,600 USD per capita in Trinidad and Tobago. Profound problems of governability are common to all six countries, and mean governance indicators reflect poor performances in all cases. The main issues are an absence of effective rule of law, political stability, and control of corruption. Fisheries are characterized by increasing effort and an absence of sustainability . Most of the fishery stocks are either fully or over exploited. This scenario can only be rectified by investments in marine protected areas and scientific research, as well as the increased participation of fishers in the development and implementation of management strategies and regulations. ]\n","839\n","iteracion 840\n","[ Metals in mangrove ecosystems and associated biota: A global perspective ]\n","840\n","[ Highlights Mangrove forests are spread along tropical and sub-tropical coastal areas. These ecosystems are frequently exposed to metals and other organic contaminants. Metals occur in sediments and associated biota (plants and animals). Contamination sources, pollution status and health hazards are highlighted. , Mangrove forests prevalent along the intertidal regions of tropical and sub-tropical coastlines are inimitable and dynamic ecosystems. They protect and stabilize coastal areas from deleterious consequences of natural disasters such as hurricanes and tsunamis. Although there are reviews on ecological aspects, industrial uses of mangrove-associated microorganisms and occurrence of pollutants in a region-specific manner, there is no exclusive review detailing the incidence of metals in mangrove sediments and associated biota in these ecosystems on a global level. In this review, mangrove forests have been classified in a continent-wise manner. Most of the investigations detail the distribution of metals such as zinc, chromium, arsenic, copper, cobalt, manganese, nickel, lead and mercury although in some cases levels of vanadium, strontium , zirconium and uranium have also been studied. Seasonal, tidal, marine, riverine, and terrestrial components are seen to influence occurrence, speciation, bioavailability and fate of metals in these ecosystems. In most of the cases, associated plants and animals also accumulate metals to different extents and are of ecotoxicological relevance. Levels of metals vary in a region specific manner and there is disparity in the pollution status of different mangrove areas.

Seasonal circulation patterns have been newly constructed from drifter trajectories. Kuroshio branching southwest of Kyushu is evident in composite drifter trajectories. Coastal currents on the shelf experience significant change from winter to summer. , We investigated seasonal circulation patterns of the Yellow and East China Seas (YECS), by reviewing previous works on the circulation and its dominant currents, and taking into account newly-compiled trajectories of satellite-tracked drifters collected between the 1980s and 2000s. The circulation patterns suggested before the 1990s can be categorized into two groups, depending on the identified origin of the Tsushima Warm Current in the Korea-Tsushima Straits: (i) branching from the Kuroshio southwest of Kyushu, or (ii) northeastward continuation of the Taiwan Strait throughflow . The branching of the Kuroshio southwest of Kyushu and northeast of Taiwan was clearly evidenced by current measurements and concurrent hydrographic surveys . However, there is still no clear evidence for the northeastward pathway of Taiwan Strait throughflow across the mid-shelf area of the East China Sea. Target-oriented surveys in the 1990s and 2000s employing advanced instruments, such as drifter tracking and acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements, now provide decisive proof of the clockwise rounding of the Cheju Warm Current around Jeju-do throughout the year, of the northeastward extension of Changjiang discharge in summer, and of the presence of the Yellow Sea Warm Current only in winter. Thus, both coastal currents in shallow water and secondary branch currents of the Kuroshio (such as the Yellow Sea Warm Current) are found to significantly change from winter to summer. To better present the basic pattern of YECS circulation and its seasonality , we have constructed seasonal circulations patterns, based on review results, on the newly-compiled drifter trajectories, and on hydrographic observations. Further investigations should be carried out in future, with support of comprehensive current measurements on shelf areas and through elaborate numerical modeling. ]\n","841\n","iteracion 842\n","[ Harmful algal blooms: A climate change co-stressor in marine and freshwater ecosystems ]\n","842\n","[ Highlights Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are intensifying in parallel with climate change. Few studies have followed interactive effects between climate change stressors and HAB species. Future studies with HAB species should consider incorporating multiple climate change stressors. , Marine and freshwater ecosystems are warming, acidifying, and deoxygenating as a consequence of climate change. In parallel, the impacts of harmful algal blooms (HABs) on these ecosystems are intensifying. Many eutrophic habitats that host recurring HABs already experience thermal extremes, low dissolved oxygen, and low pH, making these locations potential sentinel sites for conditions that will become more common in larger-scale systems as climate change accelerates. While studies of the effects of HABs or individual climate change stressors on aquatic organisms have been relatively common, studies assessing their combined impacts have been rare. Those doing so have reported strong species- and strain-specific interactions between HAB species and climate change co-stressors yielding outcomes for aquatic organisms that could not have been predicted based on investigations of these factors individually. This review provides an ecological and physiological framework for considering HABs as a climate change co-stressor and considers the consequences of their combined occurrence for coastal ecosystems. This review also highlights critical gaps in our understanding of HABs as a climate change co-stressor that must be addressed in order to develop management plans that adequately protect fisheries, aquaculture , aquatic ecosystems , and human health. Ultimately, incorporating HAB species into experiments and monitoring programs where the effects of multiple climate change stressors are considered will provide a more ecologically relevant perspective of the structure and function of marine ecosystems in future, climate-altered systems. ]\n","842\n","iteracion 843\n","[ Three simple indicators of vulnerability to climate change on a Mediterranean beach: A modeling approach ]\n","843\n","[ Highlights We built a numerical methodology to simulate the sandy beach morpho-dynamic evolution.

We use this approach to create and propose three simple approach of indicator for vulnerability of sandy beach erosion. , This study assesses three different approaches for evaluating coastal vulnerability using indicators. We began by establishing a procedure for binding three codes to simulate realistic or idealized climates. The procedure was validated in terms of hydrodynamics and beach morpho-dynamics. We then defined and studied the vulnerability of the coast on the basis of in situ observations and model results taken from a set of simulations based on different scenarios. We present three simple indicator methods developed to analyze the vulnerability of a sandy beach based on the results of simulations for different wave climate scenarios. The first method is based on the wave energy, and specifically how it differs as a function of climate change scenario. The second method consists of estimating the maximum grain size mobilized. Note that the calculation of stress at the sea bottom is routinely estimated solely on the basis of simulated velocity post-wave. Here, we calculate the maximum grain size potentially mobilized with a simpler approach, based on analysis in different points along the cross-shore profile. The third method presented is the analysis of the time-course evolution of cross-shore sea bed profiles in response to different climate change scenarios. ]\n","843\n","iteracion 844\n","[ Focusing on the receiver – Hearing in two focal cetaceans exposed to Ocean Economy developments ]\n","844\n","[ Highlights Anthropogenic noise pollution impacts hearing, the number one sense of cetaceans.

Measurements of impacts from anthropogenic developments requires baseline data. , Plans for large-scale economic developments in the Indian Ocean, including increased shipping, oil and gas exploration and offshore mining, have resulted in concerns about potential impacts on cetaceans. Two species of particular interest are the resident, coastal Indian Ocean humpback dolphin Sousa plumbea and the migratory humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae . As the two species belong to different hearing groups (high-frequency odontocetes vs low-frequency mysticetes), we review the available literature on their differing hearing mechanisms (physiology), specialities and sensitivities here as there is a lack of data available for these two species in the Indian Ocean region. The reviewed information included audiogram data, species-specific frequencies and sensitivity ranges, ear morphology and adaptations for hearing in their respective groups where available. For odontocetes, most information stems from animals under human care, while for mysticetes bioacoustic measurements, like audiograms, are more difficult to access, resulting in a lack of data on hearing for M. novaeangliae . Our review highlights an absence of baselines upon which to measure future impacts from anthropogenic developments in the Indian Ocean and we suggest future work to address this. Our work is not only timely in view of the planned anthropogenic developments in the Indian Ocean, but also has wider implications in the global context as cumulative impacts on cetaceans grow due to increased international demand for resources and associated Ocean Economy developments. ]\n","844\n","iteracion 845\n","[ Are fish in danger?

Fish populations are threatened by climate change and anthropogenic activities, which may include marine renewable energy. Research efforts focus on appropriate measurement techniques as fish enumeration in high energy areas is challenging. The most likely risk to fish from marine energy is collision with operating tidal and in-river turbine blades. Other risks may include underwater noise, electromagnetic fields, changes in habitats, entanglement, and displacement. , Many fish species are threatened worldwide by overfishing, contamination, coastal development, climate change, and other anthropogenic activities . Marine renewable energy (MRE) is under development as a sustainable alternative to carbon-based energy sources. Regulators and stakeholders worry that MRE devices will add another threat to fish populations already under pressure. This paper reviews the current knowledge of potential effects of MRE development on fish. These may include collision with devices that may lead to injury or death; underwater noise generated by MRE devices that may affect fish behavior and health; electromagnetic fields from power cables and other electrical infrastructure that may lead sensitive fish species to approach or avoid them; changes in critical fish habitat, including nursery, feeding, and spawning grounds ; shoaling of fish around MRE devices; and displacement of fish populations or communities around arrays of multiple MRE devices. Field- and laboratory-based studies that have examined fish presence, avoidance, and evasion around MRE devices suggest that collisions are rare. Progress is being made on data collection and modeling tools to estimate fish encounter rates with MRE devices, the consequences of collisions, and population-level ecological risks. Similarly, studies exposing fish to turbine-generated noise and electromagnetic fields demonstrate little effect on fish behavior; in fact, MRE device noise falls below reported hearing thresholds. Inquiries into the effects of MRE devices on fish are ongoing, and research is needed to ensure the health of fish populations while facilitating the sustainable development of renewable energy sources . ]\n","845\n","iteracion 846\n","[ Physiographic influences on dense shelf-water cascading down the Antarctic continental slope ]\n","846\n","[ Predicting the source areas for Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) requires knowledge of how cold, dense water masses form and move from the Antarctic shelves to the continental slope .

An initial transient positive anomaly was observed in both adjusted sea level and SST during May–June 1997, followed by anomalously high coastal sea levels, generally strongest during September 1997 through February 1998 and abruptly returned to normal in late February 1998, and by positive temperatures anomalies over the mid-shelf that persisted longer, into April 1998. Low-frequency coastal sea-level anomalies propagated poleward at 2.1 m/s. Poleward flow over the shelf and slope was enhanced at most depths during the El Niño, compared with following years. Northward currents in the upper 12 m over the continental shelf off Newport, Oregon averaged 13.7 cm/s stronger during August 1997 through February 1998 than during the same period the following year. Enhanced poleward flow was present at all latitudes sampled during November 1997 and February 1998, particularly over the continental slope. These transects also provided clear views of a fall/winter equatorward undercurrent, which was both strongest and had the most alongshore similarity of form, during the ENSO. Finally, subsurface-intensified anticyclonic eddies originating in the poleward undercurrent appear to be a recurrent feature of the circulation off Newport late in the upwelling season. ]\n","847\n","iteracion 848\n","[ The effects of the 1997–99 El Niño/La Niña events on hydrography and zooplankton off the central Oregon coast ]\n","848\n","[ Hydrographic data and nutrient, chlorophyll and zooplankton samples were collected biweekly at a hydrographic station off Newport, Oregon during the 1997–98 El Niño and 1998–99 La Niña event. Our monitoring in 1997 showed that coastal upwelling was initiated in April, the usual time. However, a series of southwesterly storms in May and June 1997 led to a prolonged warming event and reductions in copepod biomass. Though El Niño-driven atmospheric teleconnections might have been responsible for these storms, the coastal ecosystem returned to normal with the resumption of coastal upwelling in mid-July 1997. A downwelling event began on 20 August 1997 resulting in onshore movement of offshore waters. This event appeared to mark the passage of the first Kelvin wave. At this time the shelf became flooded with low-nutrient waters and offshore, ‘warm-water’ copepod species were transported shoreward. The abundance of local endemic boreal neritic copepod species was reduced greatly, presumably because they were transported out of the system and to the north as a result of the strong poleward flows. Poleward flows strengthened during autumn, and the ocean off Oregon remained anomalously warm through the winter of 1997, spring, and early summer of 1998. Species composition of the coastal copepod assemblage remained anomalous for about a year; species with offshore and subtropical affinities dominated from late August 1997 through late July 1998. During this same period, nitrate concentrations were reduced by a factor of 4.5 (11-month mean of 1.5 μM for August 1997–July 1998 versus 6.9 μM for August 1998–July 1999), copepod biomass was reduced by a factor of 2.1 (4.9 μg carbon l −1 versus 10.5 for the same time periods), but chlorophyll concentrations were similar (2.0 versus 2.5 μg l −1 ). Perhaps the most dramatic effect on copepods during the El Niño period was the nearly complete disappearance of the normally dominant boreal neritic copepod species ( Pseudocalanus mimus , Calanus marshallae and Acartia longiremis ) and their replacement by subtropical species such as Calanus pacificus , Paracalanus parvus , Ctenocalanus vanus , Corycaeus anglicus and several species of Clausocalanus . These species persisted in the coastal waters through the end of 1998. Although most of the subarctic species began to increase in numbers in August 1998, the impact of the El Niño on Pseudocalanus mimus , normally the numerical dominant in coastal waters, was longer lasting. The P. mimus population did not recover to normal abundance levels until summer of 1999. ]\n","848\n","iteracion 849\n","[ ‘Unlocking circular economy for prevention of marine plastic pollution: An exploration of G20 policy and initiatives’ ]\n","849\n","[ Highlights Marine plastic pollution (MPP) is of urgent ecological, economic and social concern.

Sea level fluctuations and climate changes have controlled peat accumulation since Late Pleistocene. Faster accumulation rates of peatlands in Southeast Asia are reported in the wetter Holocene epoch. Degradation and poor management of the Southeast Asian peatlands accelerated carbon emission between 2011 and 2018. , Peatlands are important carbon sinks, therefore their degradation mainly due to lowering of the water table, has an adverse effect to the carbon cycle and largely burden the atmosphere. Annually, extensive areas of these peatlands are affected by wildfires, therefore large peatland areas have been degraded, directly or indirectly related to anthropogenic activities, largely contributing to greenhouse gas emissions . Some of the most pristine tropical peatlands worldwide occur primarily at the coastal lowlands of Southeast Asia. In terms of their geological features and evolution, these sites are generally understudied despite covering more than half of the global area of tropical peatlands. This review compiles geological data from 52 peatlands from insular and continental Southeast Asia, providing a comprehensive geological dataset for future research. The Southeast Asian peatlands are mostly ombrogenous and hence poorly supplied by nutrients. During the Last Glacial Period ( ca. 115,000–11,000 years ago), extensive areas were exposed because of the lowering of the seawater level, which caused a consequent lowering of the groundwater table landwards; the forests were under severe threat, mainly due to dry conditions, thus resulting in the retreat of the forest boundaries inland. This was an unfavourable environment for peatland formation and hence, most of the Southeast Asian peatlands were formed right after that period. Almost 40% of the reviewed sites are located on Borneo Island, highlighting the importance of Bornean peatlands, where many peatlands are already deforested and drained and converted to plantations. Overall, the available geological data from the Southeast Asian peatlands is incomplete and non-comparable to each other because each study has a different focus. Details, such as the type of peat-forming plants, age of peat , peat thickness, substrate type and the pH value are not reported systematically in approximately 30% of the reviewed sites, while other important geological data, such as the ash yield and the carbon content of peat are only reported in 30% and 10% of the reviewed sites, respectively. Characterisation of peatlands using data imputation and principal component analysis (PCA) is based on three physical parameters (maximum ash yield, maximum thickness and oldest age), and includes the study of their relation in terms of climatic periods, peatland type, region and substrate. It is observed that peatlands which were developed in warming periods share similar physical parameters (such as accumulation rates, ash yield, peatland type, and environment of the substrates). With better data reporting on these parameters, the PCA analysis can provide a more accurate reflection of peatland characteristics and their relationships. The study aims to raise awareness on the importance and vulnerability of the Southeast Asian peatlands and to highlight their role in the global climate fluctuations. ]\n","850\n","iteracion 851\n","[ Palynological and organic geochemical analyses of the Upper Cretaceous Bozeș Formation at Petrești (southwestern Transylvanian Basin) – biostratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental implications ]\n","851\n","[ Highlights The Campanian palynomorphs, southwestern Transylvanian Basin, Romania, are studied.

The samples were collected from the marine Bozeş as well as from the overlying continental Sebeş formations, with main focus on the Bozeș Formation. The recovered palynomorph assemblages are represented mainly by early angiosperm pollen and by fern spores. Phytoplankton taxa are either absent or were recorded only as rare occurrences in the upper part of the Bozeş Formation.

Climate change will affect polar marine ecosystem structure, function &amp; connectivity. , We compare and contrast the ecological impacts of atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns on polar and sub-polar marine ecosystems. Circulation patterns differ strikingly between the north and south. Meridional circulation in the north provides connections between the sub-Arctic and Arctic despite the presence of encircling continental landmasses, whereas annular circulation patterns in the south tend to isolate Antarctic surface waters from those in the north. These differences influence fundamental aspects of the polar ecosystems from the amount, thickness and duration of sea ice, to the types of organisms, and the ecology of zooplankton, fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Meridional flows in both the North Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans transport heat, nutrients, and plankton northward into the Chukchi Sea, the Barents Sea, and the seas off the west coast of Greenland. In the North Atlantic, the advected heat warms the waters of the southern Barents Sea and, with advected nutrients and plankton, supports immense biomasses of fish, seabirds and marine mammals. On the Pacific side of the Arctic, cold waters flowing northward across the northern Bering and Chukchi seas during winter and spring limit the ability of boreal fish species to take advantage of high seasonal production there. Southward flow of cold Arctic waters into sub-Arctic regions of the North Atlantic occurs mainly through Fram Strait with less through the Barents Sea and the Canadian Archipelago. In the Pacific, the transport of Arctic waters and plankton southward through Bering Strait is minimal. In the Southern Ocean, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its associated fronts are barriers to the southward dispersal of plankton and pelagic fishes from sub-Antarctic waters, with the consequent evolution of Antarctic zooplankton and fish species largely occurring in isolation from those to the north. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current also disperses biota throughout the Southern Ocean, and as a result, the biota tends to be similar within a given broad latitudinal band. South of the Southern Boundary of the ACC, there is a large-scale divergence that brings nutrient-rich water to the surface. This divergence, along with more localized upwelling regions and deep vertical convection in winter, generates elevated nutrient levels throughout the Antarctic at the end of austral winter. However, such elevated nutrient levels do not support elevated phytoplankton productivity through the entire Southern Ocean, as iron concentrations are rapidly removed to limiting levels by spring blooms in deep waters. However, coastal regions, with the upward mixing of iron, maintain greatly enhanced rates of production, especially in coastal polynyas. In these coastal areas, elevated primary production supports large biomasses of zooplankton, fish, seabirds, and mammals. As climate warming affects these advective processes and their heat content, there will likely be major changes in the distribution and abundance of polar biota, in particular the biota dependent on sea ice. ]\n","853\n","iteracion 854\n","[ Implementation options for DNA-based identification into ecological status assessment under the European Water Framework Directive ]\n","854\n","[ Highlights eDNA and metabarcoding are options for complementing and replacing morphological identification.

Remaining challenges for all BQEs include the modification of assessment indices and completing barcode libraries. Methods are least suited for BQEs that are surveyed rather than sampled (e.g. macrophytes). , Assessment of ecological status for the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is based on “Biological Quality Elements” (BQEs), namely phytoplankton , benthic flora, benthic invertebrates and fish. Morphological identification of these organisms is a time-consuming and expensive procedure. Here, we assess the options for complementing and, perhaps, replacing morphological identification with procedures using eDNA, metabarcoding or similar approaches. We rate the applicability of DNA-based identification for the individual BQEs and water categories (rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters) against eleven criteria, summarised under the headlines representativeness (for example suitability of current sampling methods for DNA-based identification, errors from DNA-based species detection), sensitivity (for example capability to detect sensitive taxa, unassigned reads), precision of DNA-based identification (knowledge about uncertainty), comparability with conventional approaches (for example sensitivity of metrics to differences in DNA-based identification), cost effectiveness and environmental impact. Overall, suitability of DNA-based identification is particularly high for fish, as eDNA is a well-suited sampling approach which can replace expensive and potentially harmful methods such as gill-netting, trawling or electrofishing . Furthermore, there are attempts to replace absolute by relative abundance in metric calculations. For invertebrates and phytobenthos , the main challenges include the modification of indices and completing barcode libraries. For phytoplankton, the barcode libraries are even more problematic, due to the high taxonomic diversity in plankton samples. If current assessment concepts are kept, DNA-based identification is least appropriate for macrophytes (rivers, lakes) and angiosperms/macroalgae (transitional and coastal waters), which are surveyed rather than sampled. We discuss general implications of implementing DNA-based identification into standard ecological assessment , in particular considering any adaptations to the WFD that may be required to facilitate the transition to molecular data. ]\n","854\n","iteracion 855\n","[ Levels and trends of tributyltin (TBT) and imposex in dogwhelk ( Nucella lapillus ) along the Norwegian coastline from 1991 to 2017 , Corrigendum to “Levels and trends of tributyltin (TBT) and imposex in dogwhelk ( Nucella lapillus ) along the Norwegian coastline from 1991 to 2017” [Mar.

The post-Cenomanian uplift caused an inversion of Cretaceous basins and generated a landscape in which the most elevated landforms correspond either to resistant post-rift sedimentary cover, or to residuals of Cretaceous rift shoulders, above a low erosion surface. Since no evidence of a former post-Cenomanian sedimentary cover of significant thickness was found outside the coastal fringe, we could evaluate the uplift to 600 m at most and the mean erosion rates to 10 m/Ma or less. However, according to models based upon the results of thermochronological analyses (apatite fission tracks analysis-AFTA), two slices of 1000 m to 2500 m would have been deposited over the present pile in the south part of the study area, respectively in Campanian and Oligocene-Miocene times, before being totally removed. We examine here the diverging scenarios of geomorphic evolution respectively based upon morphostratigraphy (our model) and upon low temperature thermochronology , submitting them to available evidence provided by an updated and geographically extended review of geomorphological and sedimentological data, and trying to decipher some of the reasons that might lead to disputable geomorphic interpretations. We stress the fundamental importance of taking into account all the available results of geomorphological and geological approaches in any interpretation of thermochronological and other analytic methods used for reconstructing long-term landscape evolutions . This is one of the conditions for reinforcing the trust one can have in their results, which may bring complementary or unique information, peculiarly in places where sedimentary or volcanic markers are missing. ]\n","857\n","iteracion 858\n","[ Plant invasion in mangrove forests worldwide ]\n","858\n","[ Highlights We provide an overview of plant invasion in the world’s mangrove forests. The diversity of microhabitat promotes invasion in mangrove forest. Key traits of mangrove invaders are discussed. Invaders could affect habitat conditions, mangrove regeneration and their fauna. Invasive plant management strategy should be integrated into mangrove management. , Plant invasion is a major threat to natural ecosystems, and mangrove forests are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world. However, since mangrove species primarily occur in the saline and intertidal environment that is inhospitable for most terrestrial and freshwater plants, it is commonly assumed that mangrove forests are resilient to plant invasion. Still, many salt tolerant aquatic and terrestrial plants as well as epiphytes are found to invade the mangrove forests, and we know little about those invasive plants, their functional traits, invasion patterns and pathways and their ecological consequences. In a survey of global literature, we found a total of 57 plants reportedly invasive in the world’s mangrove forests. These plants possessed the traits of salinity tolerance, tolerance to anaerobic condition, high fecundity and rapid growth. About 19% of invasive plants were anthropogenically introduced for coastal land stabilization, and the rests were accidental introduction. Invaders were found to colonize along the forest edges or forest interior, but mostly in the raised lands. That is, the presence of diversified microhabitats such as raised land and intertidal mudflat might help both halophytic and non-halophytic plants to invade the mangrove forests. Some invaders (30%) were transient, but many (70%) could persist for a longer time; and these species could modify habitat conditions, impede natural regeneration of mangroves and disrupt their faunal assemblage. Together, plant invasion in mangrove forests is much more widespread and problematic than commonly perceived, underscoring the need for the integration of invasive plant management strategy into mangrove forest management. ]\n","858\n","iteracion 859\n","[ Centers of organic carbon burial and oxidation at the land-ocean interface ]\n","859\n","[ Continental margin systems collectively receive and store vast amounts of organic carbon (OC) derived from primary productivity both on land and in the ocean, thereby playing a central role in the global carbon cycle. The land-ocean interface is however extremely heterogeneous in terms of terrigenous input, marine primary productivity, sediment transport processes and depositional conditions (e.g. such as bottom water oxygen level). Continental margins are also highly dynamic, with processes occurring over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. The rates of OC burial and oxidation are consequently variable over both space and time, hindering our ability to derive a global picture of OC cycling at the land-ocean interface. Here, we review the processes controlling the fate of organic matter in continental margin sediments, with a special emphasis on “hot spots” and “hot moments” of OC burial and oxidation. We present a compilation of compositional data from a set of illustrative settings, including fjords , small mountainous river margins, large deltaic systems and upwelling areas. Bulk OC stable isotope and radiocarbon compositions reveal the diversity and complexity characteristic of OC buried in marginal seas . This primarily relates to differences in marine and terrestrial inputs, the composition of the terrestrial component (e.g. vascular plant OC, soil, and petrogenic OC inputs), and processes modulating the fate of OC within the marine environment (e.g. priming). This widely contrasting behavior of OC among these systems illustrates that the reactivity of OC is a product of its chemical composition and regional conditions. Interpreted in the context of bulk compositional data as well as that obtained on specific molecular markers (e.g. lignin-derived phenols), the possibility exists to tease apart complex mixtures of terrestrial and marine inputs, and to shed light on the role of the myriad of depositional and post-depositional processes. Finally, we discuss a set of hot topics that warrant further investigation – such as the role of photochemistry , fungi, halogenation and reactive iron in dictating the fate of OC in the (changing) coastal ocean. ]\n","859\n","iteracion 860\n","[ Problems and prospects of revitalizing marine pearl cultivation in highly urbanized coasts: A case study of Tolo Harbour in Hong Kong ]\n","860\n","[ Highlights This paper reconstructs the history of pearling, part of Hong Kong’s marine heritage. There was not enough policy and scientific support for the industry in the past. Pearl oyster cultivation brought benefits to the urbanized coastal city, Hong Kong. Suggestions are made for the revitalization of the pearl oyster culture industry. , Pearl farming is part of Hong Kong’s maritime heritage. Its history in the territory can be traced back irregularly for over a millennium, focussed on what was then known as the Tai Po Sea ( now Tolo Harbour ( Tolo Gang ( )). For a short period in the 10th century AD Southern Han ( , during the turbulent Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period ( ), the pearl farming became a tightly guarded Imperial monopoly. Thereafter the detail is uncertain but pearl fishing would seem to have continued, if not on a large scale, until the British annexation of the New Territories in 1898, although the centre of gravity , focussed on edible oysters, had moved to Deep Bay. An attempt was made to begin a cultivated pearl industry in Tolo Harbour in the 1960s but it failed. In this paper we seek to reconstruct the history of that episode and reveal the reasons why the ventures failed based on interviews with participants, newspaper clippings, government records and records kept by the Hong Kong Heritage Project. Despite government support, key failings were an inability to find the way to cultivate oysters in Hong Kong and a deficiency of wild pearl oysters available for grafting. Based on this historical lesson, the feasibility of revitalizing the pearl cultivation industry in highly urbanized coastal cities like Hong Kong, including improvements to water quality via biofiltration , are evaluated and discussed. Some recommendations are made for enabling the industry to be viable and sustainable. ]\n","860\n","iteracion 861\n","[ Impacts of nitrogen pollution on corals in the context of global climate change and potential strategies to conserve coral reefs ]\n","861\n","[ Highlights Anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus increase in the oceans and seas. Nitrogen can directly affect corals, or indirectly through algae and viruses. Nitrate enrichment and ammonium enrichment have different effects on corals. The tolerance thresholds for nitrogen can greatly differ among corals. Reducing nitrate input and CO 2 emissions are promising conservation strategies. , Ocean warming has severe impacts on coral reef ecosystems with frequent incidences of coral bleaching . In addition, eutrophication poses an increasing threat to coral reef environments and has been found to increase the vulnerability of corals to thermal bleaching. Eutrophication has accelerated in recent years with coastal nutrient loads expected to continue to increase under global change. However, the mechanisms by which nutrient pollution affects corals and coral reefs are still under debate, in particular with regard to nitrogen. The main objective of this paper is to review mechanisms by which nitrogen pollution affects coral health and corresponding strategies to reduce the impact of nitrogen pollution. Different coral species possess varying tolerance thresholds for nitrogen enrichment and corals show differential responses to enrichment with nitrate and ammonium. Nitrate assimilation increases oxidative stress in corals, promotes growth of the phototrophic symbionts in corals, and induces phosphate starvation in these symbionts, which further impairs the symbiosis. In contrast, a moderate supply of ammonium is mostly beneficial for coral development. In addition, combined nitrogen and phosphorous enrichment can indirectly compromise coral health by enhancing macroalgae growth and increasing the incidence of coral diseases caused by predation on corals. It must be realized that both levels of nutrient pollution and the stoichiometric ratios of C: N: P: Fe availabilities determine the ultimate effect of nutrients on coral health. We confirm the strategy to conserve coral reefs via coral-targeted water quality management , in particular by including a reduction of the nitrate influx and by proper management of fish stocks to facilitate healthy reef ecology. ]\n","861\n","iteracion 862\n","[ Contemporary research in aeolian geomorphology ]\n","862\n","[ The first International Conference on Aeolian Geomorphology (ICAR) was held in 1986, and every four years since then, aeolian geomorphologists from around the world have assembled to discuss their research and to showcase recent advancements in understanding and modeling of aeolian processes.

Areas of focus have shifted historically from initial concerns with aeolian erosion and dust events as isolated phenomenon of localized curiosity or only regional importance, to comprehensive physically-based investigations and modeling of the mechanics of aeolian transport. Recently, more applied studies have been motivated by the recognition of the importance of aeolian processes to dust emissions into the atmosphere (with relevance for human health and for meteorological conditions and climate change) and within regional management contexts (especially on coasts where impending sea-level rise is of great concern and in arid and semi-arid environments given the dependence of sediment surface stability and remobilization on meteorological and ecological conditions).

Beagle (1831–1836) under Captain Robert FitzRoy and the United States Exploring Expedition (1838–1842) under Lieutenant Charles Wilkes. The former expedition mainly surveyed coastal South America, but also visited many volcanic islands in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. The latter expedition followed a similar path through the Atlantic, but devoted more time to Pacific Ocean islands. Remembered more today for his visit to the Galapagos Islands and its subsequent impact on understanding the mechanisms of biological evolution, Darwin was motivated early on during his stopover in the Cape Verde Islands to compile studies on the geology of volcanic islands. Better known for his theory of atoll development from the subsidence of volcanic islands stimulated by his visit to the Keeling Islands and published in 1842, Darwin also wrote a related volume published in 1844 with an equally strong emphasis on island uplift. Dana was influenced by Darwin's theory of atoll development, and published his own independent observations on coral reefs and island subsidence in 1843, 1849, and 1853. The work of both geologists matured from primary observations using inductive logic during fieldwork (i.g. unconformable position of limestone on and between basalt flows as an indicator of paleo-sea level) to the advancement of broader theories regarding the behavior of the Earth's oceanic crust . Notably, Dana recognized age differences among islands in Pacific archipelagos and was strongly influenced by the orientations of those island groups. The classic Hawaiian model that features a linear string of progressively older and subsiding islands does not apply easily to many other island groups such as the Galapagos, Azores , Canary, and Cape Verde islands. Geologists and coastal geomorphologists increasingly find that the original observations on island uplift covered in Darwin's, 1844 treatment provide an alternative pathway to understanding the complexities of island histories in oceanic settings. Original work by Darwin and Dana also led to ongoing studies on the trans-oceanic migrations of marine organisms, such as barnacles, corals and non-attached coralline red algae represented by rhodoliths. This work gives added importance to oceanic islands as way stations in the dispersal of biotas over time. ]\n","863\n","iteracion 864\n","[ Tsunami risk reduction – are we better prepared today than in 2004? ]\n","864\n","[ With over 220,000 fatalities, the 26 December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest natural hazard events ever, and represents a landmark in disaster risk reduction governance in several ways. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami led to a better understanding of the likelihood of tsunami occurrence and potential tsunami inundation. For example, the Hyogo Framework Agreement was a direct result of this event. Since December 2004, Indonesia, Samoa, Chile and Japan were hit by altogether six destructive tsunamis in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2011. This article looks into the progress (or lack thereof) made in tsunami risk reduction at the local level during the past ten years, with focus on the densely populated coastal regions of Indonesia and Sri Lanka.

Climate-water impacts include water cycle intensification, crop yield reduction, soil losses, declining of water resources. Water use efficiency in agriculture can strike a balance between water supply and consumption in Greece. , Τhe management and protection of a country's water resources is a matter of high priority, ensuring the development and socio-economic stability of a country. Unquestionably, Greece is a characteristic example of this, as water distribution is highly spatially and temporally unequally distributed, while irrigation and tourist consumers as well as the pollution load are expected to be increased in the near future. Water resources in Greece are particularly affected by climate extremes, with droughts, floods and soil erosion by water being the utmost consequences. Greece consumes the greatest amount of its available water resources in the agricultural sector. Also, there is much evidence of water shortage and bad/poor chemical status of some water bodies, mainly due to saltwater intrusion in coastal agricultural areas and intensively agricultural activities. Therefore, this review provides a literature update on the quantity and quality aspects of water resources in Greece for each water body, focusing on water relation effects (aridity/drought, floods and soil erosion by water). This paper, based on different sources of information and an extensive database of water related data, collects, evaluates and groups data from a quantity and quality point of view for all the different water bodies of Greece. Specific water districts such as the Aegean islands, the eastern part of Crete, Attica and Thessaly are expected to be the most affected by climate-water impacts with reduced crops yields, a greater risk of droughts and/or floods, a loss of agricultural land, declining water availability, and degraded water resources (surface and groundwater). Based on these findings, the proposed review highlights agricultural adaptation practices for increasing water use efficiency , ensuring the sustainability of water resources in Greece. ]\n","865\n","iteracion 866\n","[ Effects of fringing reefs on tsunami inundation: American Samoa ]\n","866\n","[ A numerical model of tsunami inundation, Delft3D, which has been validated for the 29 September 2009 tsunami in Tutuila, American Samoa, is used to better understand the impact of fringing coral reefs and embayments on tsunami wave heights, inundation distances, and velocities. The inundation model is used to explore the general conditions under which fringing reefs act as coastal buffers against incoming tsunamis. Of particular interest is the response of tsunamis to reefs of varying widths, depths, and roughness, as well as the effects of channels incised in the reef and the focusing effect of embayments. Model simulations for conditions similar to Tutuila, yet simplified to be uniform in the alongshore, suggest that for narrow reefs, less than about 200 m wide, the shoaling owing to shallow water depths over the fringing reef dominates, inducing greater wave heights onshore under some conditions and farther inundation inland. As the reef width increases, wave dissipation through bottom friction begins to dominate and the reef causes the tsunami wave heights to decrease and the tsunami to inundate less far inland. A sensitivity analysis suggests that coral reef roughness is important in determining the manner in which a fringing reef affects tsunami inundation. Smooth reefs are more likely to increase the onshore velocity within the tsunami compared to rough reefs. A larger velocity will likely result in an increased impact of the tsunami on structures and buildings. Simulations developed to explore 2D coastal morphology show that incised channels similar to those found around Tutuila, as well as coastal embayments, also affect tsunami inundation, allowing larger waves to penetrate farther inland. The largest effect is found for channels located within embayments, and for embayments that narrow landward. These simulations suggest that embayments that narrow landward, such as Fagafue Bay on the north side of Tutuila, and that have an incised deep channel, can cause a significant increase in tsunami wave heights, inundation distances, and velocities. Wide embayments, similar in size to Massacre Bay, induce some tsunami amplification, but not as much as for the narrowing embayment. ]\n","866\n","iteracion 867\n","[ Biological and chemical consequences of the 1997–1998 El Niño in central California waters ]\n","867\n","[ The physical, chemical and biological perturbations in central California waters associated with the strong 1997–1998 El Niño are described and explained on the basis of time series collected from ships, moorings, tide gauges and satellites. The evolution of El Niño off California closely followed the pattern observed in the tropical Pacific. In June 1997 an anomalous influx of warm southerly waters, with weak signatures on coastal sea level and thermocline depth, marked the onset of El Niño in central California. The timing was consistent with propagation from the tropics via the equatorial and coastal wave-guide. By late 1997, the classical stratified ocean condition with a deep thermocline, high sea level, and warm sea surface temperature (SST) commonly associated with El Niño dominated the coastal zone. During the first half of 1998 the core of the California Current, which is normally detected several hundred kilometers from shore as a river of low salinity, low nutrient water, was hugging the coast. High nutrient, productive waters that occur in a north–south band from the coast to approximately 200 km offshore during cool years disappeared during El Niño. The nitrate in surface waters was less than 20% of normal and new production was reduced by close to 70%. The La Niña recovery phase began in the fall of 1998 when SSTs dropped below normal, and ocean productivity rebounded to higher than normal levels. The reduction in coastal California primary productivity associated with El Niño was estimated to be 50 million metric tons of carbon (5 × 10 13 g C). (5 × 10 13 g C). This reduction certainly had deleterious effects on zooplankton, fish, and marine mammals. The 1992–1993 El Niño was more moderate than the 1997–1998 event, but because its duration was longer, its overall chemical and biological impact may have been comparable. How strongly the ecosystem responds to El Niño appears related to the longer-term background climatic state of the Pacific Ocean. The 1982–1983 and 1992–1993 El Niños occurred during the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO may have changed sign during the 1997–1998 El Niño, resulting in weaker ecological effects than would otherwise have been predicted based on the strength of the temperature anomaly. ]\n","867\n","iteracion 868\n","[ Synthesis of the Conference on Management and Conservation of Seagrass Ecosystems in India ]\n","868\n","[ Highlights The conference, a first in India to bring together 51 national and international seagrass experts.

Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) aims to lower the input of this waste by culturing other species of low trophic level which feed on them. Despite the appealing idea of IMTA, its implementation is very limited in marine ecosystems . Focusing on marine fish farming, in general terms, fish farm waste is not expected to constitute a relevant food source for low-trophic level organisms cultured in the water column. We propose Regional Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture (RIMTA) as a shift of paradigm in the way IMTA is used to sequester the dissolved exported waste and derived primary production generated by high trophic level cultures. RIMTA advocates for independent allocation of cultures of low and high trophic level species within the same water body. RIMTA implementation should be economically supported through tax benefits or nutrient quota trading schemes. Moving from IMTA to RIMTA should not only foster aquaculture sustainability but also the circular economy and the ecosystem services that the low trophic level cultures provide. ]\n","869\n","iteracion 870\n","[ Restoring rocky intertidal communities: Lessons from a benthic macroalgal ecosystem engineer ]\n","870\n","[ Highlights Fucoid algae can be important ecosystem engineers in rocky reef ecosystems Sewage-effluent disposal negatively affects fucoids and associated communities Restoring fucoid populations can improve biodiversity of degraded systems Clarifying the roles of fucoids in ecosystem function can improve restoration efforts Thresholds of engineering traits and associated environmental conditions important , As coastal population growth increases globally, effective waste management practices are required to protect biodiversity.

Yet the impact of ocean sprawl on sedimentary environments has largely been ignored. Here we review current knowledge of the impacts to sedimentary ecosystems arising from artificial structures. Artificial structures alter the composition and abundance of a wide variety of sediment-dependent taxa, including microbes , invertebrates, and benthic-feeding fishes. The effects vary by structure design and configuration, as well as the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the environment in which structures are placed. The mechanisms driving effects from artificial structures include placement loss, habitat degradation, modification of sound and light conditions, hydrodynamic changes, organic enrichment and material fluxes, contamination, and altered biotic interactions. Most studies have inferred mechanism based on descriptive work, comparing biological and physical processes at various distances from structures. Further experimental studies are needed to identify the relative importance of multiple mechanisms and to demonstrate causal relationships. Additionally, past studies have focused on impacts at a relatively small scale, and independently of other development that is occurring. There is need to quantify large-scale and cumulative effects on sedimentary ecosystems as artificial structures proliferate. We highlight the importance for comprehensive monitoring using robust survey designs and outline research strategies needed to understand, value, and protect marine sedimentary ecosystems in the face of a rapidly changing environment. ]\n","872\n","iteracion 873\n","[ The monsoon currents in the north Indian Ocean ]\n","873\n","[ The monsoon currents are the seasonally reversing, open-ocean currents that flow between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, the two wings of the north Indian Ocean. The Summer Monsoon Current (SMC) flows eastward during the summer monsoon (May–September) and the Winter Monsoon Current (WMC) flows westward during the winter monsoon (November–February). We assemble data on ship drifts, winds and Ekman drift, and geostrophic currents derived from altimetry and hydrography to describe the observed climatological seasonal cycle of the monsoon currents. We then use an Oceanic General Circulation Model (OGCM) to simulate these currents and estimate their transports, and a 1 1 2 1 1 2 -layer reduced-gravity model to investigate the processes that force them. The monsoon currents extend over the entire basin, from the Somali coast to the eastern Bay of Bengal. They do not, however, come into being, or decay, over this entire region at a given time. Different parts of the currents form at different times, and it is only in their mature phase that the currents exist as trans-basin flows. The westward WMC first forms south of Sri Lanka in November and is fed initially by the equatorward East India Coastal Current (EICC); the westward WMC in the southern Bay appears later. In its mature phase during December–March, the WMC flows westwards across the southern Bay; it divides into two branches in the Arabian Sea. One of these branches continues flowing westwards, whereas the other turns around the Lakshadweep high (a sea-level high off southwest India) to flow into the poleward West India Coastal Current (WICC). The WMC is primarily a geostrophic current, modulated by Ekman drift. The eastward flowing SMC first appears in the southern Bay during May. In its mature phase, which peaks with the summer monsoon in July, the SMC in the Arabian Sea is a continuation of the Somali Current and the coastal current off Oman. It flows eastward and southeastward across the Arabian Sea and around the Lakshadweep low (a sea-level low off southwest India), eastward south of Sri Lanka, and into the Bay of Bengal. Strong winds during the summer monsoon ensure that Ekman drift dominates at the surface, leading to a more complex vertical structure in the SMC than in the WMC. In the depth-averaged flow over 50 m, the mature phase of the SMC lasts from May to September. The numerical experiments show that the dynamics of the north Indian Ocean on seasonal time scales can be explained by linear wave theory. The circulation at any point is decided by both local forcing and remote forcing, whose signals are carried by equatorial and coastal waves. Superimposed on the currents associated with these waves is the local Ekman drift. The geostrophic component of the monsoon currents is forced by several processes. In the Bay of Bengal, the monsoon currents are forced by Ekman pumping and by the winds in the equatorial Indian Ocean. In the eastern Arabian Sea, the major forcing mechanisms are the winds along the east and west coasts of India and Sri Lanka; these processes link the parts of the SMC in the Arabian Sea and the Bay during the summer monsoon, and of the WMC early during winter. Ekman pumping in the central Arabian Sea and off the Somali coast forces the monsoon currents in the central and western Arabian Sea, with Rossby waves radiated from the Indian west coast also playing a role. Therefore, the monsoon currents consist of several parts, each of which is forced by one or more processes, which act in concert to produce the continuous currents seen flowing across the breadth of the north Indian Ocean. ]\n","873\n","iteracion 874\n","[ Potential effects of climate change on the chemical quality of aquatic biota ]\n","874\n","[ Climate changes can alter and modify the distribution and the partitioning of contaminants in water bodies through several factors (e.g., rise in temperature, decrease in oxygen through water scarcity, acidification and remobilization of pollutants in sediments due to flooding). Other indirect effects can be linked to climate changes (e.g., increased use of pesticides due to the rise of plant diseases caused by new vectors and erosion of coastal areas due to rise in sea level). All these factors have the potential to enhance the bioavailability of dangerous pollutants with bioaccumulative properties with an increasing risk of transfer in the food chain. The data available on aquatic species for compounds such as, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins and mercury show that the legislative standards for food are exceeded in some areas. These data also show that levels in aquatic biota of other emerging compounds with bioaccumulative properties (such as, perfluorinated octane sulfonate, polybrominated diphenyl ethers and hexabromocyclododecane can be relevant in some areas and at some trophic levels. In particular, the effect of climate changes can be relevant in vulnerable water bodies (e.g., estuaries of rivers or coastal lagoons), where fishing, extensive and intensive aquaculture activities and sites of high biodiversity value are often present. For these reasons, there is a need to change the water-monitoring strategies with a focus on analytical methods for biota determination and to have monitoring programs that include detection of long-term trends and share procedures for the setting of quality criteria for biota. ]\n","874\n","iteracion 875\n","[ Harmful algal blooms: How strong is the evidence that nutrient ratios and forms influence their occurrence? ]\n","875\n","[ There is a perception that anthropogenically-driven changes in nutrient supply to coastal waters influences the abundance, frequency and toxicity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) through a change in the form or ratio of nutrient that limits phytoplankton growth. If nutrient concentrations are not limiting for growth, then ratios do not influence floristic composition. At non-limiting concentrations, evidence that alteration of nitrogen: phosphorus (N:P) ratios has stimulated HABs is limited, and primarily based on hypothesised relationships in relatively few locations (in particular: Tolo Harbour Hong Kong and Dutch Coastal Waters). In all cases, an unequivocal causal link between an increase in HABs (frequency, magnitude or duration) and change in N or P as the limiting nutrient is difficult to establish. The silicon (Si) limitation hypothesis is generally supported by experimental evidence and field data on the nuisance flagellate Phaeocystis . We found little evidence that high N:Si ratios preferentially promote harmful dinoflagellates over benign species. Laboratory studies demonstrate that nutrient ratios can influence toxin production, but genus and species specific differences and environmental control make extrapolation of these data to the field difficult. Studies of the role of dissolved and particulate organic nutrients in the growth of HAB species, while limited, demonstrate the potential for organic nutrients (especially organic N) to support the growth of a range of HAB species. There is a clear need for better understanding of the role of mixotrophy in the formation of HABs and for studies of HAB and non-HAB species in competition for environmentally realistic concentrations of organic nutrients. ]\n","875\n","iteracion 876\n","[ A novel index based on planktonic copepod reproductive traits as a tool for marine ecotoxicology studies ]\n","876\n","[ Highlights Response of some copepod species reproductive traits in natural contamination conditions.

This work reviewed the results of previous studies examining changes in egg production rate (EPR), hatching success (HS), and nauplius survival rate (NSR) in natural conditions and in the presence of pollutants, including heavy metals and organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). At high concentrations, cadmium and silver induce an increase in EPR in the copepods Acartia tonsa and Acartia hudsonica , while exposure to mercury decreases EPR in adults by 50%. All three metals affect HS, with mercury inducing a stronger effect than cadmium and silver. Cadmium affects reproductive traits in Centropages ponticus , decreasing EPR and particularly HS. Furthermore, copper and chromium at high concentrations induce significant decreases in eggs per female in Notodiaptomus conifer . In terms of organic contaminant and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Eurytemora affinis is reported to be affected by naphthalene , 2-methylnaphthalene, 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene, and 2,3,5-trimethylnaphthalene and can thus be used in ecotoxicity studies, but only if the exposure time is high. Acartia tonsa shows significant reductions in EPR and HS at high concentrations of fluoranthene , phenanthrene , and pyrene . However, the response to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) such as pentachlorophenol (PCP) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) differs. In E. affinis , EPR increases with DCB, but HS falls to &lt;1%. EPR increases when the species is exposed overnight, but HS remains low in the presence of DCB. Based on these results, we developed a novel copepod reproductive trait index (CRT-Index) for use in marine ecotoxicology surveys and tested in some simple cases. We show that copepods are good candidates as models for ecotoxicology studies, in particular using reproductive traits (EPR, HS and NSR) because of their sensitivity to a wide range or pollutants. ]\n","876\n","iteracion 877\n","[ Landslides and Quaternary climate changes—The state of the art ]\n","877\n","[ Climatic factors are considered major causes and triggers of slope instability, but the palaeoclimatic implications of landslides have not yet been systematically reviewed. As inferred from landslides dated to the Late Glacial and Holocene , glacial-interglacial transitions are the major intervals of enhanced landsliding, but the length of this interval varies between distinct types of landscapes. Mass movements in non-glaciated temperate mountain ranges, arid and tropical regions, and coastal areas intensified soon after the onset of the Holocene alongside the warming and wetting of the climate, whereas large rock slides in areas within the limits of Pleistocene glaciations mostly show a millennial-scale time lag with respect to glacier withdrawal. Although the incidence of landslides was ubiquitous throughout the Holocene, the mid- to late-Holocene transition (~5–4 ka) was especially favourable for the origin of landslides across distinct types of landscapes, indicating a strengthened role of mass movements during the culmination phases of interglacial climate optima. In addition, growing evidence suggests that the enhanced activity of landslides occurred during warmer interstadial conditions, which is best demonstrated in the temporal coincidence of arid-zone landslides with Quaternary “pluvials”. Future progress in the understanding of the relationships between landslides and Quaternary climate changes should benefit from the i) extension of datasets of dated landslides, ii) geographical expansion of dating studies to regions with a lack of chronologically determined landslides (e.g., tropics), iii) improvement of landslide-dating strategies involving the incorporation of independent palaeoclimatic proxies and iv) wider incorporation of numerical modeling within landslide-dating studies. ]\n","877\n","iteracion 878\n","[ Sustainable development of the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem ]\n","878\n","[ Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) are relatively large areas of ocean space, adjacent to the continents in coastal waters where primary productivity is generally high.

Inundation of the Sendai Plain and the offshore wave sources of both tsunamis are compared. The Jogan tsunami deposit is ubiquitous on the coastal plains of Sendai Bay, whereas, to date, it is only identified in a few locations along the Sanriku and Joban Coasts. This resulted in an underprediction of the size of the wave source of the Tohoku-oki tsunami. The inland boundary of the inundation area of the Tohoku-oki tsunami on the Sendai Plain is approximately equivalent to that of the Jogan tsunami, although many sedimentological and geomorphologic factors make a direct comparison of the tsunamis complicated and difficult.

Phyto- and zooplankton in the estuaries form important components of the pelagic food webs that participate in producing and structuring the matter, energy, and information fluxes in the ecosystems. Due to salinity gradients, estuaries provide a large variety of aquatic habitats for native populations of marine, brackish and fresh water plankton species. Non-indigenous planktonic species that expand their bio-geographical range and invade the Baltic coastal ecosystems also find favourable environments, establish permanent populations there, and impact aboriginal ecosystems. The dynamics of abundance, species diversity, population structure, productivity of planktonic communities, and peculiarities of trophic interactions in different Baltic estuaries are influenced by a number of common environmental factors. Being measured on the unified basis and monitored, changes (or stability) of structural and functional parameters of plankton communities can serve as indicators of alterations to the ecosystems.

We compiled 780 published igneous rock ages to age-code a 1:500, 000 digital geological map, which was then used to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of the associated magmatism . Regional igneous rocks can be divided into four major emplacement episodes: 190–175 Ma , 165–155 Ma , 145–125 Ma , and 105–95 Ma , with the first two episodes dominated by intrusive rocks emplaced in the Jurassic in inland South China (~550–1200 km away from the trench), and the latter two episodes mostly eruptive rocks emplaced in the Cretaceous along coastal areas (~400–800 km away from the trench). To investigate the association of these events with the history of subduction , we calculated the slab flux along eastern China using two published global plate tectonic reconstructions. We found that the slab flux (per kilometer) between ~145 Ma and 120 Ma along eastern China was up to 0.018 km 2 /yr, which is much larger than the global average for the last 200 Myr (0.005 km 2 /yr); this period of large slab flux largely coincides with Early Cretaceous magmatism in the region. Combined with the geochemical characteristics of these rocks, we propose that Cretaceous magmatism in South China was related to underplating caused by dehydration of the subducting Izanagi slab. In contrast, the slab flux was much lower (0.003–0.007 km 2 /yr) during the period of Jurassic magmatism. We used the two considered plate reconstructions to drive three mantle flow models, which predict that upper mantle upwellings occurred beneath the SCB in the Jurassic, triggered by subducting slabs. A hydrous mantle transition zone, which could have developed due to long-term subduction around the SCB, is likely to have facilitated these mantle upwellings and caused partial mantle melting. We propose that these mantle upwellings and associated hydrous melting, could have caused the melting of continental crust and induced Jurassic intraplate magmatism in the SCB. ]\n","885\n","iteracion 886\n","[ Cycling of black carbon and black nitrogen in the hydro-geosphere: Insights on the paradigm, pathway, and processes ]\n","886\n","[ Highlights Dissolution of black carbon (DBC) and black nitrogen (DBN) is of emerging concern.

The present review suggests that high anthropogenic inputs and enrichment of marine sediments by bulk terrigenous DOC ( δ 13 C ~ −20‰ to −25‰) lead to high DOC/DON ratios (≥10), which correlate with seasonal hydrology and diagenetic events. The stability of refractory residues like pyrrole for black nitrogen (BN) and aromatic hydrocarbons for (BC) under pedogenic and diagenetic processes needs to be addressed, considering time lags between production and resuspension events. A variation in absolute values of δ 15 N (2.0 to 7.0‰) in organically sequestered marine sediments indicates complex sources of various nitrogen-enriched organic carbon (OC) and dynamic erosion processes. These natural events are signified by an OC/DBN ratio of 13.3 ± 3.5, often explained by variations in precursor organic materials. Complex biogeochemical evolution at forest and agricultural ecosystem levels, coupled with anthropogenic influences, renders δ 15 N values between −10 and 10‰, which are lower than in marine ecosystems (6–10‰).

However, these depositional models generally lack relevant information about sedimentary processes, transport mechanisms and controlling factors on offshore sediment redeposition , which are potential sources of information for sequence stratigraphic, palaeoclimate and exploration studies. Several examples from the Neogene Betic basins of the western Mediterranean region have been selected to integrate the processes and controlling factors on the offshore sediment transport and the resulting deposits. Additional published data from other Mediterranean localities have also been considered. An idealized model of temperate-water carbonate deposition in the study examples comprises a shallow-water coastal belt and a shoal area developed landwards of a carbonate-factory zone, and deeper-water outer-ramp, slope, and basin settings below the storm wave base. The environments off the factory bear a variety of remobilized deposits characterized by distinctive features. These deposits include storm shell beds, sediment gravity flows (debrites and turbidites), bed packages with hummocky and swaley cross-stratification (HCS and SCS), slope sandwaves, and channel as well as lobe deposits. The different types of redeposited facies resulted from various offshore sediment-transport processes interacting with the local conditions. Storm shell beds developed in low-energy protected basins, regardless of the ramp profile. Debrites and turbidites formed in the distal parts of moderately-steep ramps within moderately energetic hydrodynamic contexts. Similar gradients but with higher hydrodynamic energy and appropriate sediment grain size favoured the formation of deposits with HCS and SCS in relatively deep-water settings. The circulation pattern of currents within the basin was the main factor controlling the formation of downslope migrating sandwaves. In the case of channel and lobe deposits, hydrodynamic-flow behaviour through the channels and at the transition point conditioned the features of the resulting deposits. Offshore resedimentation is consistent with a highstand shedding model in the case of storm-driven event deposits (storm beds, sediment gravity flows and deposits with HCS–SCS) while offshore directed and persistent unidirectional currents generated prograding margin clinoforms during falling and low sea levels. This review provides a concise depositional framework to understand the different redeposition processes operating in low-energy, temperate-water carbonate ramps and to interpret remobilized deposits in low-energy regions such as the Mediterranean Sea. ]\n","888\n","iteracion 889\n","[ Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating: a review of principles and practice ]\n","889\n","[ Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating (SHD) is a numerical, calibrated-age dating technique based on the degree of weathering of rock surfaces. The Schmidt hammer measures the hardness or strength of a rock surface by means of R-values (rebound values), which are produced as the hammer impacts the surface. Age calibration is carried out with reference to at least two surfaces of known age (control surfaces). Mean R-values then yield numerical estimates of the time elapsed since exposure of rock surfaces to subaerial weathering. Under favourable circumstances with a sufficiently large number of impacts, SHD has an age resolution of 300–500 years for rock surfaces exposed during the Holocene and Late Pleistocene , and a current age range of ~25 ka. Accurate independent dating of control surfaces and careful selection of sites to reduce the effects of lithological variability are essential. R-value distributions are an important aid in the interpretation of SHD ages from active and relict, synchronous and diachronous, single and multiple-event surfaces. Important research applications have been made within the fields of Quaternary geochronology , palaeoenvironmental reconstruction, geomorphology and subaerial processes, and landscape dynamics. SHD has been found particularly useful in relation to boulder deposits and bedrock surfaces in glacial and periglacial environments . There is much untapped potential in coastal, temperate and tropical landscapes wherever rock surfaces are exposed to undisturbed rock weathering. The advantages and limitations of SHD compare favourably with the complementary exposure-age technique of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating (TCND). The capability to provide a large number of exposure ages at low cost, and non-destructively in sensitive natural and artefactual settings, are special strengths of SHD. ]\n","889\n","iteracion 890\n","[ Realistic test cases for limited area ocean modelling ]\n","890\n","[ The applicability of Modular Ocean Model version 4 (MOM4p1) as a code base to study regional physical oceanographic phenomena is presented, highlighting features recently implemented for use in limited area domains.

The top three threats to seabirds in terms of number of species affected and average impact are: invasive alien species, affecting 165 species across all the most threatened groups; bycatch in fisheries, affecting fewer species (100) but with the greatest average impact; and climate change/severe weather, affecting 96 species. Overfishing, hunting/trapping and disturbance were also identified as major threats to seabirds. Reversing the top three threats alone would benefit two-thirds of all species and c. 380 million individual seabirds (c. 45% of the total global seabird population). Most seabirds (c. 70%), especially globally threatened species, face multiple threats. For albatrosses, petrels and penguins in particular (the three most threatened groups of seabirds), it is essential to tackle both terrestrial and marine threats to reverse declines. As the negative effects of climate change are harder to mitigate, it is vital to compensate by addressing other major threats that often affect the same species, such as invasive alien species, bycatch and overfishing, for which proven solutions exist. ]\n","891\n","iteracion 892\n","[ Chapter 6 Biogeochemistry of Polynyas and Their Role in Sequestration of Anthropogenic Constituents ]\n","892\n","[ Polynyas are common occurrences all around the Arctic and Antarctic. Coastal polynyas are generally highly productive, which can lead to substantial CO 2 drawdown. Consequently, they are important sink regions for atmospheric CO 2 . Depending on the surface area, the timing, duration and other factors, large differences exist as to the importance of polynyas in a biogeochemical sense. In the Arctic, the North Water Polynya seems to be the most important one, while in the Antarctic the most important is the Ross Sea Polynya. Polynyas in the Arctic have been better investigated and therefore the important polynyas are described with some confidence as to accuracy and completeness. For the Antarctic, this only holds for the Ross Sea Polynya. For many other Antarctic polynyas, only incomplete information is available. This is true even for the large, well known Weddell Polynya of the 1970s, which represents one of the few open-ocean polynyas. Here its biogeochemical role is semi-quantitatively assessed by combining the physical data from the 1970s with the known distributions of biogeochemical properties from recent years. It is deduced that the Weddell Polynya was a significant one-time sink for anthropogenic CO 2 and CFCs, with ensuing deep-sea sequestration. Notably, some coastal polynyas are instrumental in transferring anthropogenic CO 2 from the ice-free shelves to the abyssal oceans. ]\n","892\n","iteracion 893\n","[ An overview of monitoring methods for assessing the performance of nature-based solutions against natural hazards ]\n","893\n","[ Highlights NBS monitoring frameworks which measure multifunctionality are virtually non-existent. Indicators are set to evaluate the success and performance of NBS projects. There is an absence of worldwide accepted and standard approaches to NBS monitoring. Combining data from ground-based techniques and remote sensing offers new opportunities to monitor NBS. NBS are complex features and monitoring their functioning requires expensive equipment. , To bring to fruition the capability of nature-based solutions (NBS) in mitigating hydro-meteorological risks (HMRs) and facilitate their widespread uptake require a consolidated knowledge-base related to their monitoring methods, efficiency, functioning and the ecosystem services they provide. We attempt to fill this knowledge gap by reviewing and compiling the existing scientific literature on methods, including ground-based measurements (e.g. gauging stations, wireless sensor network) and remote sensing observations (e.g. from topographic LiDAR, multispectral and radar sensors) that have been used and/or can be relevant to monitor the performance of NBS against five HMRs: floods, droughts, heatwaves, landslides, and storm surges and coastal erosion . These can allow the mapping of the risks and impacts of the specific hydro-meteorological events. We found that the selection and application of monitoring methods mostly rely on the particular NBS being monitored, resource availability (e.g. time, budget, space) and type of HMRs. No standalone method currently exists that can allow monitoring the performance of NBS in its broadest view. However, equipments, tools and technologies developed for other purposes, such as for ground-based measurements and atmospheric observations , can be applied to accurately monitor the performance of NBS to mitigate HMRs. We also focused on the capabilities of passive and active remote sensing, pointing out their associated opportunities and difficulties for NBS monitoring application. We conclude that the advancement in airborne and satellite-based remote sensing technology has signified a leap in the systematic monitoring of NBS performance, as well as provided a robust way for the spatial and temporal comparison of NBS intervention versus its absence. This improved performance measurement can support the evaluation of existing uncertainty and scepticism in selecting NBS over the artificially built concrete structures or grey approaches by addressing the questions of performance precariousness. Remote sensing technical developments, however, take time to shift toward a state of operational readiness for monitoring the progress of NBS in place (e.g. green NBS growth rate, their changes and effectiveness through time). More research is required to develop a holistic approach, which could routinely and continually monitor the performance of NBS over a large scale of intervention. This performance evaluation could increase the ecological and socio-economic benefits of NBS, and also create high levels of their acceptance and confidence by overcoming potential scepticism of NBS implementations. ]\n","893\n","iteracion 894\n","[ The Amazon-influenced muddy coast of South America: A review of mud-bank–shoreline interactions ]\n","894\n","[ The 1500 km-long coast of South America between the Amazon and the Orinoco river mouths is the world's muddiest. This is due to the huge suspended-sediment discharge of the Amazon River (10 6 × 754 tons yr − 1 ± 9%), part of which is transported alongshore as mud banks. Mud-bank formation is controlled by the physical oceanography of the continental shelf seaward of the Amazon River mouth, an initial seafloor storage area for much of the suspended sediment discharged from the river. In this area, rapid and sustained fluid-mud concentration and trapping are associated with fresh water–salt water interaction and estuarine front activity on the shelf due to the enormous Amazon water discharge (ca. 173,000 m 3 s − 1 at Obidos, 900 km upstream of the mouth). Fluid mud is transported shoreward and then along the coasts of the Guianas by a complex interaction of wave and tidal forcing, and wind-generated coastal currents. The mud banks, which may number up to 15 or more at any time, are up to 5 m-thick, 10 to 60 km-long, and 20 to 30 km-wide, and each may contain the equivalent mass of the annual mud supply of the Amazon. As the banks migrate alongshore, their interaction with waves results in complex and markedly fluctuating shorelines that are associated with space- and time-varying depositional ‘bank’ phases and erosional ‘inter-bank’ phases. Bank zones are protected from wave attack as a result of wave-energy dampening by mud, and undergo significant, albeit temporary, coastal accretion accompanied by rapid mangrove colonization. The dampening of waves in bank areas as they propagate onshore is accompanied by the shoreward recycling of mud, commonly in the form of individual mud bars. These bars progressively undergo desiccation and consolidation, and thus constitute a major pathway for rapid and massive colonization by mangroves. Erosion by waves propagating across relatively mud-deficient shoreface zones in inter-bank areas can lead to muddy shoreline retreat rates of tens of metres to several kilometres over a few months to a few years, accompanied by massive removal of mangroves. Notwithstanding the higher incident wave energy on inter-bank shores, inter-bank shorefaces are permanently muddy due to the pervasive influence of the Amazon muddy discharge. Inter-bank and transitional bank-to-inter-bank phases are associated with both periodic sandy chenier formation and extreme forms of rotation of rare headland-bound sandy beaches. The high mud supply from the Amazon has been the overarching geological control on the Quaternary evolution of the northeastern South American coast, having led to the growth of a muddy shelf clinoform at the mouth of the Amazon and more or less important progradation throughout this coast. Net progradation reflects an imbalance in favour of deposition during each mud-bank–inter-bank cycle. The high mud supply has presumably blanketed shelf sand deposited by smaller rivers during eustatic lowstand phases. The shelf clinoform structure at the mouth of the Amazon and the muddy coastal progradation throughout the coast of the Guianas and into Venezuela provide analogues of the geological record on muddy shorefaces. ]\n","894\n","iteracion 895\n","[ Suspended sediment dynamics during the inter-monsoon season in the subaqueous Mekong Delta and adjacent shelf, southern Vietnam ]\n","895\n","[ Land–ocean interactions in the coastal zone are severely influenced by tidal processes. In regions of high sediment discharge like the Mekong River Delta in southern Vietnam, these processes are even more significant. Three cruises in 2006, 2007 and 2008 were carried out to investigate the sediment suspension and their spatial distribution. Additionally, we investigated the influence of the tidal currents in relation to the suspended sediment. Therefore, all cruises took place during the inter-monsoon season between March and May where wave and wind influences are not dominant in contrast to the summer monsoon (May to early October) and winter monsoon season (November to early March). Suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) in the particle-size range between 2.5 and 500 μm were measured with an LISST-instrument (Laser In Situ Scattering and Transmissiometry). Current velocities and directions were recorded with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). Additionally, data of different tidal gauge stations in the Mekong River Delta were correlated and compared to the mixed semidiurnal–diurnal tidal cycle. Our results show significant areas of SSCs greater than 25 μl/l in the Mekong River branches and its subaqueous delta during the inter-monsoon season. 20% of all measured SSCs in the subaqueous Mekong Delta exceed 100 μl/l. Highest concentrations occur close to the seabed. SSCs decrease at the transition to the open shelf. The shelf region contains only low suspension loads, especially on the south-eastern shelf (99% of all samples &lt;25 μl/l). However, in the southern shelf region around Ca Mau Cape the suspension load is also higher (&gt;25 μl/l) close to the seabed in water depths of 20–25 m. Two surveys lasting 25 h each were performed on mooring stations in 12 m (Mooring 1) and 26 m (Mooring 2) water depth and located 3.2 km apart on the subaqueous delta slope. Similar patterns of SSC over time show that concentrations of suspension load correlate with the tidal current velocities. High tidal current velocities of up to 0.6 m/s near the sea bottom generate increasing SSCs of more than 25 μl/l in the water column. Additionally a significant trend of decreasing SSC from the near-seabed to the upper part of the water column can be observed. In terms of sediment transport the ebb phase dominates the tidal cycle by its higher tidal current velocities but the flood phase has the longer duration. The switch of the tidal current direction from ebb to flood phase occurs rapidly against which the change from flood to ebb phase requires up to 3 h. This leads to an asymmetry of the tidal ellipses and may cause a net-sediment transport from the shelf into the subaqueous Mekong Delta. In the subaqueous Mekong Delta and adjacent shelf, seven transects show similar patterns of SSCs dependent to the tidal phase. A hypopycnal sediment plume from the subaqueous Mekong Delta into the shelf region was not observed. Our results imply that resuspension by tidal currents dominates the sediment transport in the subaqueous Mekong Delta and adjacent shelf regions during the inter-monsoon season. ]\n","895\n","iteracion 896\n","[ A review of hydrodynamics and water quality of Lake Nokoué: Current state of knowledge and prospects for further research ]\n","896\n","[ Highlights In 1960, Lake Nokoué entrances into the Atlantic Ocean had been widened. Consequently, the saline water intrusion during the low water periods has increased. During the high water period, tributaries freshwater push the saline water out of the lake. The riverine nutrient inputs promote the development of water hyacinth on the lake. All the water hyacinth died and sink to the bottom when salinity increase. There is crucial need to establish the full nutrient budget of the system. Decision makers should focus on continuous monitoring of water quality and hydrology. , A systematic literature review was undertaken to identify the significant changes that have affected the hydrodynamics and the water quality of Lake Nokoué (Benin, West Africa) since 1960 and to emphasise the relationship between both. It appeared that the construction of the port of Cotonou in early 1950 permanently opened Lake Nokoué to the Atlantic Ocean and subsequently its retention time has considerably decreased from more than one year to about 40 days. During low water periods from December to mid-May, the hydrodynamics of the lake is influenced by tidal variation. This leads to a significant increase in the salinity of the lake from freshwater to brackish water with an average salinity of 16 ppt. During high water periods, freshwater inflows from tributaries invade the lake and keep the sea water out. Inorganic nutrient concentrations in the lake increase from the low water to the high water period, partially as a result of inputs from the lake tributaries. Yet, to date, the other external sources of nutrient loads in the lake, as well as the internal nutrient loads of the lake, have not been quantified. Therefore an important management question is whether the control of external nutrient loads alone is sufficient to significantly reduce the eutrophication problems of Lake Nokoué. This implies that further research on the lake could investigate the components of the nutrient budget including the influence of seasonal water hyacinth death during low water periods (caused by increased salinity), on the internal nutrient loads. Urgent management actions should consider a continuous spatio-temporal monitoring of the system in order to generate long time series data which will help to model the relationship between hydrodynamics and water quality and to understand the linkage of both with the biodiversity occurring in Lake Nokoué and more generally in tropical coastal lakes. ]\n","896\n","iteracion 897\n","[ Conservation and restoration of mangroves: Global status, perspectives, and prognosis ]\n","897\n","[ Highlights Coastal mangrove forests provide irreplaceable services to people and nature, making their protection critical.

Mangrove conservation would benefit from understanding the complex interrelationships between social and natural systems. , Mangrove forests provide critical services around the globe to both human populations and the ecosystems they occupy.

We examine threats to the persistence of mangroves, consequences, and potential solutions for effective conservation. We present case studies from disparate regions of the world, showing that the integration of human livelihood needs in a manner that balances conservation goals can present solutions that could lead to long-term sustainability of mangrove forests throughout the world. ]\n","897\n","iteracion 898\n","[ Sponge meadows and glass ramps: State shifts and regime change ]\n","898\n","[ Highlights Glass ramps are shallow coastal depositional regimes dominated by siliceous sponges. Sponge meadows were alternate stable states in contrast to carbonate factories. Glass ramps were limited by silica flux and lack modern analogues. Review of Phanerozoic cases reveals sponges' environmental flexibility and ecological dominance. , Glass ramps are coastal marine sedimentation regimes of siliceous biomineralization , and present alternatives to carbonate or siliciclastic deposition. Prominent chert deposits around the world record glass ramps from the Eocene , Jurassic, Permian , and Mississippian. These events ranged from regional to continental scale, and lasted from a couple million years to over ten million years. This review compares established cases of glass ramp deposition to clarify the bio-depositional features that distinguish glass ramps from other bedded or mounded biosiliceous deposits, and from carbonate ramp regimes. It also compares environmental contexts of glass ramp initiation and persistence. The primary sediment on these glass ramps is disaggregated spicules of siliceous sponges. The sponges formed meadows on level-bottom inner- and mid-ramp settings, and loose spicules were redistributed along the shelf. Carbonate bioclasts were generally present but diluted by the great abundance of spicules. Carbonate factories were either limited to small, dense patches; moved offshore; or re-established at a later time. Glass ramps initiated in a wide variety of climates and oceanographic settings but appeared to initially require partial protection from storm energy. The importance of marine silicic acid for such widespread biosiliceous factories is also estimated, showing that glass ramps required long-term adjustments in silica supply. Glass ramps lack modern analogues, but their ecology can be interpreted in light of stable state dynamics in other modern invertebrate communities. It is suggested that siliceous sponge meadows were an alternate stable state locally on carbonate ramps, occurring with greater frequency and carrying greater ecological significance than have been previously expected. This model warrants additional scrutiny on sponge meadows' possible stabilizing feedbacks and on the thresholds of state switching. ]\n","898\n","iteracion 899\n","[ Microplastic particles in the Persian/Arabian Gulf – A review on sampling and identification ]\n","899\n","[ Highlights Omnipresence of microplastics in Gulf marine and coastal environments is established. Little effort has gone into investigating microplastics in the Persian/Arabian Gulfmarine pollutants. Compares methodologies used for microplastic studies in the Gulf region The heavier microplastics quickly sink to the sediments. Use of acid digestion can degrade microplastics and result in erroneous determination. , Microplastics are ubiquitous, persistent pollutants that are reported in abundance within the marine environment. Their presence in seawater and marine sediments poses a legitimate environmental and ecological concern for toxicity and food chain transfer via marine organisms. Their capability for sorption of other hydrophobic contaminants and the inability of the wastewater treatment plants to completely remove them pose additional risks. This review highlights the methodologies for sampling, sample preparation, and identification used in the Persian/Arabian Gulf region, which is possibly one of the least studied marginal seas with only sixteen papers published on microplastics. The review highlights the several orders of magnitude variations in microplastic concentrations among different studies; e.g. in seawater, only 12 microplastic particles were reported from 40 transects of one km length in Kuwait to 0.71 microplastics m −3 in Qatar. Concentrations in beach sediments also show the significant difference between the northern and southern Gulf coasts, with 13 particles in 24 samples reported in Qatar, and 15 particles within 44 samples across Kuwait, to 3252 ± 2766 particles m −2 from Bandar Abbas, Iran. The biota samples also show similar variances, with only three particles identified from 87 gut samples in Kuwait to 828 particles in 58 samples that include 46 fish and 12 shrimps from Iran. Some extremely high concentrations in biota are also reported from Iran, with concentrations as high as 0.251 particles g −1 of muscle and 0.931 particles g −1 in gills. It is evident that there is no consensus in the Gulf region on the sampling techniques (mesh size of plankton nets and sieves), use of fluidization solutions and very different units used in data reporting such as particles m −3 and particles m −2 in water samples. In sediments units like particles g −1 and particles m −2 have been used, and for biota it is the number of particles present in the sample, while others have quantified data as particles g −1 of tissue. Considering the higher densities of PET , PVC, nylon and polyester than seawater, they are likely to migrate downwards into marine sediments, a transfer process that has not been studied in detail. Thus the review underscores the need to adopt harmonized protocols for microplastic studies in the region, and identifies certain aspects of microplastics that require further study. ]\n","899\n","iteracion 900\n","[ Marine debris occurrence and treatment: A review ]\n","900\n","[ Marine debris produces a wide variety of negative environmental, economic, safety, health and cultural impacts.

Data from an extensive literature review and original fieldwork demonstrates that many landforms and geomorphic features of modern river systems appear in the Palaeozoic stratigraphic record once terrestrial vegetation had adopted certain evolutionary advances. For example, stable point bars are associated with the onset of rooted plants in the Siluro-Devonian and avulsive and anabranching fluvial systems become common at the same time as extensive arborescent vegetation in the Carboniferous. In this paper, we demonstrate a correlation between the diversification of physical fluvial environments and the expansion of terrestrial fauna and flora, with an emphasis on the culmination of these trends within Carboniferous alluvial systems. Many extrinsic factors have been considered as possible controls on the evolutionary timelines of terrestrialization for organisms. However, a fundamental prerequisite for achieving terrestrial biodiversity was the variety of physical habitats, especially riparian systems, available for newly evolved organisms. In association with abundant lowland meandering systems, the widespread appearance across Carboniferous alluvial plains of fixed-channel and anabranching reaches created further physical landforms for colonization and would have promoted increasingly complex hyporheic flow regimes. Furthermore the associated increase in arborescent vegetation and supply of large woody debris to inland and coastal rivers would have created a wealth of microhabitats for continental organisms. We argue that the expanding extent and diversity of physical alluvial niches during the Palaeozoic is an underappreciated driver of the terrestrialization of early continental life. The study of the deep-time fossil and stratigraphic record also illustrates that vegetation is a fundamental prerequisite for the creation of biogeomorphic alluvial landforms and physical habitats and microhabitats . ]\n","901\n","iteracion 902\n","[ Global scanning of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: occurrence, wastewater treatment and hazards in aquatic systems ]\n","902\n","[ Highlights Antidepressants are increasingly studied indicators of an urbanizing water cycle.

Unfortunately, implementation of waste management systems and wastewater treatment infrastructure is not yet meeting these global megatrends. Herein, pharmaceuticals are indicators of an urbanizing water cycle; antidepressants are among the most commonly studied classes of these contaminants of emerging concern.

Weathering geochronology provides the appropriate tool for testing these models. New and published 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology of 346 grains of Mn oxides extracted from weathering profiles representing four regionally recognized landsurfaces in southeastern Brazil reveals that weathering minerals record minimum ages for the surfaces hosting the weathering profiles . Weathering profiles at the highest elevation surfaces are as old as ~70 Ma; those at intermediate surfaces formed post ~13 Ma; incipient profiles at incised valleys range from ~4–1 Ma; and the shallowest and least evolved weathering profiles at coastal plains yield ~1.0–0.8 Ma ages. The oldest and highest elevation landsurfaces are blanketed by deep (&gt;150 m) chemically stratified lateritic profiles; intermediate surfaces host deep saprolites (ca. 40–60 m) capped by regional stone lines; and shallow (5–20 m) and young weathering profiles cover the more deeply dissected parts of the landscape within intracontinental valleys and along the coastal plains. The hierarchy in ages and elevations for the weathering profiles suggests that the landscape in southeastern Brazil evolved through alternation of weathering-prone periods interrupted by periods of uplift and widespread incision.

Presently, hundreds of thousands of people live in very vulnerable sites, and it seems impossible to avoid potential catastrophe, especially in the poorest neighborhoods, which are located in intermountain areas of the main valleys and in the foothills of the northern Caribbean Mountains. In these areas, urban expansion since 1950 can be traced very clearly, as the result of population growth close to the center of the main economic activities. This chapter analyzes some of the most remarkable disasters that have recently affected Venezuela. The impacts of disorganized urban growth on alluvial fans and the catastrophic flood on the north face of the Caribbean Mountains of Venezuela are presented here in historical perspective.

Holistic, standardised and quantitative environment risk assessment frameworks are essential here, because previous assessments have either been qualitative in nature, or have generally considered single threats in isolation. We review these threats and utilise the RLE framework to quantitatively assess the risk of ecosystem collapse. Historical clearing and diminishing fish populations drove a status of Endangered (range: Vulnerable to Endangered ), and ongoing threats including climate change and reduced freshwater supply may further impact this ecosystem.

Following an actualistic approach, the ecology of extant relatives of the most abundant and diverse fossil groups recorded in the CKL (i.e., vascular plants , arthropods, fishes, and tetrapods) is considered. Data is based on an extensive literature review followed by a re-examination of recently collected fossils. This approach allowed a detailed appraisal of the stratigraphic/ecological distribution of the main fossil groups preserved in the CKL. Plant and animal groups are recorded in three main stratigraphic intervals, named Intervals I–III in ascending order. Most fossils are to be considered autochthonous to parautochthonous and have been preserved in distinct stages of base-level fluctuations within a shallow lacustrine depositional system, subject to periodic flooding in large, depressed areas. Exceptional preservation in such environments was mediated by microbially-induced processes (i.e., microbial mat entombment), mostly in the coastal areas of the alkaline lake. Based on the distinct sedimentary facies and autecological attributes of dominant paleo-bioindicators, a new paleoenvironmental model for the CKL is proposed, encompassing a seasonal, semi-arid, shallow lacustrine wetland. Faunal and floral content were ecologically arranged in long-lasting aquatic zones, surrounded by periodically flooded mesophytic ecotones and outer xeric habitats, as in the modern alkaline lake Chad in Africa. Our data show the relevance of multiproxy analyses (i.e., paleontological, sedimentological, geochemical, and stratigraphic) of exceptional fossil sites for assessing paleoenvironmental conditions in depositional settings subject to continuous base-level changes, such as those existing in complex, present-day wetland ecosystems . The recognition of key parameters in ancient wetlands is of great importance concerning the formation of non-marine Konservat-Lagerstätten in the geological record . ]\n","908\n","iteracion 909\n","[ Arsenic in waters, soils, sediments, and biota from Mexico: An environmental review ]\n","909\n","[ Highlights Overview with high As levels in waters, soils, sediments and biota is presented. High As levels in Mexico are related mainly with geogenic, mining and thermal origin. High As in groundwater occurs in arid and semi-arid areas in the center-north Mexico. As is widely distributed in marine biota ; sharks and rays exhibit the highest levels. There is lack of As studies in coastal areas mainly in Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. , We reviewed over 226 studies dealing with arsenic (As) in water bodies (124 sites or regions; 5,834 samples), soils (44; 2,700), sediments (56; 765), rocks (6; 85), mine waste (25; 582), continental plants (17 (77 species); 571), continental animals (10 (32 species); 3,525) and aquatic organisms (27 (100 species) 2,417) in Mexico. In general, higher As concentrations were associated with specific regions in the states of Hidalgo (21 sites), San Luis Potosi (SLP) (19), Baja California Sur (15), Zacatecas (5), and Morelos (4). High As levels have been detected in drinking water in certain locations of Coahuila (up to 435 μg L −1 ) and Sonora (up to 1004 μg L −1 ); in continental surficial water in Puebla (up to 780 μg L −1 ) and Matehuala, SLP (up to 8684 μg L −1 ); in groundwater in SLP (up to 16,000 μg L −1 ) and Morelia, Michoacán (up to 1506,000 μg L −1 ); in soils in Matehuala, SLP (up to 27,945 μg g −1 ) and the Xichú mining area, Guanajuato (up to 62,302 μg g −1 ); and in sediments in Zimapán, Hidalgo (up to 11,810 μg g −1 ) and Matehuala, SLP (up to 28,600 μg g −1 ). In contaminated arid and semi-arid areas, the plants P. laevigata and A. farnesiana exhibit the highest As levels. These findings emphasize the human and environmental risks associated with the presence of As in such regions. A synthesis of the available techniques for the removal of As in water and the remediation technologies for As contaminated soils and sediments is given. The As occurrence, origin (geogenic, thermal, mining and anthropogenic) and evolution in specific regions is summarized. Also, the mobilization and mechanisms to explain the As variability in continental environments are concisely given. For future research, a stratified regional sampling is proposed which prioritizes critical sites for waters, soils and sediments, and biota, considering the subpopulation of foods from agriculture, livestock, and seafood. It is concluded that more detailed and comprehensive studies concerning pollution levels, as well as As trends, transfer, speciation, and toxic effects are still required. ]\n","909\n","iteracion 910\n","[ Nutrient variability during El Niño 1997–98 in the California current system off central California ]\n","910\n","[ Nutrient conditions off central California during the 1997–98 El Niño are described.

Perturbations associated with El Niño are shown as anomalies of thermohaline and nutrient distributions along this section. The anomalies were obtained by subtracting seasonal averages for the period from April 1988 to April 1991 from the 1997–98 observations. The first indications of El Niño conditions (high sea levels) were observed at Monterey between late May and early June 1997, but the coastal nutricline did not begin to deepen until August 1997. It reached maximum depth of 130 dbar in January 1998 at the time that maximum sea level anomalies were observed. During this period: (1) the highest subsurface temperature anomalies coincided with subsurface nutrient anomaly minima at the depth of the pycnocline; (2) southern saline and nutrient-poor waters occupied the upper 80 dbar of the water column along the entire section; and (3) nitrate levels were close to zero in the euphotic zone, collapsing the potential new primary production in the coastal domain. At the end of February 1998, the nutricline shoaled to 40 dbar at the coast although it remained anomalously deep offshore. Higher temperatures and lower nutrient levels were observed for the entire section through August 1998 although in contrast with the previous winter, there was a strong freshening mainly due to an onshore movement of subarctic waters. ]\n","910\n","iteracion 911\n","[ Trends in exploitation, development and management of artisanal mud crab ( Scylla serrata- Forsskal-1775) fishery and small-scale culture in Kenya: An overview ]\n","911\n","[ Mud crab ( Scylla serrata ) is a delicacy for subsistence consumption in fisher communities and tourist hotels in the coast of Kenya while export demand to markets in China and Japan is expanding and provides competitively higher prices. Crab exploitation and degradation of the mangrove forests have increased over the last decades therefore threatening the capture fishery. The preferred market size crab has consistently decreased from more than 1 kg two decades ago to the current size of 0.5 kg therefore posing both management and livelihood threat to the critical ecosystem (mangrove) and coastal populations. To meet the increased tourist and export demand and provide surplus for the local community while conserving the critical crab ecosystem, small-scale aquaculture has been initiated in the concept of silvofisheries. Initial culture methods have targeted sub-adult crabs of 150–350 g for culture to market size (&gt;0.5 kg) in drive-in cages and pens (mud crab fattening). These technology attained survival of between 50 and 70% and a market price of 5 dollars per kilogram. However, research is ongoing to assess viability of stocking juvenile seed crabs directly in ponds as practised in South East Asia (SEA) as opposed to stocking of sub-adults in drive-in cages. In comparison with other areas, crab capture fisheries in East Africa have limited management and enforcement frameworks/capabilities within the wider regional fisheries policies. Also there is limited understanding of wild mud crab resources and suitable management options to avoid over-exploitation as observed in SEA. The double-edged demand (wild market size capture and juvenile capture for aquaculture) for mud crabs in addition to mangrove degradation are likely to cause great challenges to stock exploitation and livelihoods of the coastal people dependent on the resource. This review paper provides an inside onto the tradition, trends and options for development of mud crab capture and culture in Kenya. ]\n","911\n","iteracion 912\n","[ Perspective on Uncertainty Quantification and Reduction in Compound Flood Modeling and Forecasting ]\n","912\n","[ This perspective discusses the importance of characterizing, quantifying, and accounting for various sources of uncertainties involved in different layers of Hydrometeorological and Hydrodynamic model simulations as well as their complex interactions and cascading effects (e.g., uncertainty propagation) in forecasting Compound Flooding (CF).

A warming climate along with increased urbanization in flood-prone areas are expected to contribute to an escalation in the risk of CF in the near future.

In today's ocean such sediments are deposited in coastal upwelling areas like those in the Gulf of California, off Peru or off the Namibian coast and euxinic basins like the Black Sea. In an attempt to distinguish both environments by their specific TM patterns, some important conclusions may be drawn: 1) The TM enrichment seen in both environments broadly is rather similar. 2) Upwelling sediments are often enriched in Cd and P and depleted in Co and Mn. 3) Sapropels have a tendency towards higher enrichments in Ba and Mo, S, Re, As, Cu, Ni, Sb, and Fe, reflecting the strong sulfidation in an anoxic water column. 4) Upwelling systems cover a broad range of environmental settings where the steepness of the slope, the proximity of H 2 S to the sediment seawater interface and the intensity of bio-accumulation and regeneration play an important role for TM accumulation. 5) The TM content of anoxic basins is mainly controlled by TM availability in the water column and sedimentation rate. 6) Enhanced bio-productivity is the main switch turning an oxygenated into an anoxic environment. Cretaceous black shales (OAE 2) exhibit TM signatures of both, coastal upwelling areas and sapropels. The strong enrichments in Cd, Mo, Tl, V, Cu, Ni, (Bi), and Sb demonstrate that bio-accumulation and presence of H 2 S in the water column and associated sulfidation processes persisted during this time interval in large parts of the Proto-Atlantic. The usefulness of Ba as a paleoproductivity-proxy is obscured by diagenesis. The extreme accumulation in Ag and Zn requires either an additional TM source, for instance hydrothermal input, or a different TM seawater composition during the Cretaceous. The geochemical data suggest, that the major driving force for the widespread occurrence of C/T black shales seems to be the increase in volcanic activity and associated CO 2 -input throughout the Cretaceous. The ocean-atmosphere system operated in a mode different from today during this time interval. After conversion of the “nutrient” CO 2 into organic matter the system switched back into the “normal” operational mode. ]\n","914\n","iteracion 915\n","[ English Nature's Estuaries Initiative: A review of its contribution to ICZM ]\n","915\n","[ Estuary Management Plans and Estuary Partnerships were established at more than 40 English estuaries as a result of English Nature's Estuaries Initiative, which commenced in 1992.

Zoonotic and vector-borne (ZVBID) infectious diseases form an important group of diseases emerging and reemerging worldwide. 15 years of research in French Guiana (South America) on ZVBID reveals new insights onto the wildlife-ecosystem-disease nexus. Environmental, demographic, socioeconomic changes in French Guiana favor the development of ancient and new ZVBID. , French Guiana is a European ultraperipheric region located on the northern Atlantic coast of South America. It constitutes an important forested region for biological conservation in the Neotropics. Although very sparsely populated, with its inhabitants mainly concentrated on the Atlantic coastal strip and along the two main rivers, it is marked by the presence and development of old and new epidemic disease outbreaks, both research and health priorities. In this review paper, we synthetize 15 years of multidisciplinary and integrative research at the interface between wildlife, ecosystem modification, human activities and sociodemographic development, and human health. This study reveals a complex epidemiological landscape marked by important transitional changes, facilitated by increased interconnections between wildlife, land-use change and human occupation and activity, human and trade transportation, demography with substantial immigration, and identified vector and parasite pharmacological resistance. Among other French Guianese characteristics, we demonstrate herein the existence of more complex multi-host disease life cycles than previously described for several disease systems in Central and South America, which clearly indicates that today the greater promiscuity between wildlife and humans due to demographic and economic pressures may offer novel settings for microbes and their hosts to circulate and spread. French Guiana is a microcosm that crystallizes all the current global environmental, demographic and socioeconomic change conditions, which may favor the development of ancient and future infectious diseases. ]\n","916\n","iteracion 917\n","[ Arctic Ocean Mn-stratigraphy: genesis, synthesis and inter-basin correlation ]\n","917\n","[ Across the Arctic Ocean, late Quaternary deep marine sediments are characterized by the occurrence of brownish layers intercalated with yellowish to olive gray sediments. These layers show enhanced levels of bioturbation , peaks in Mn content, and typically contain elevated abundances of planktonic and benthic micro- and nannofossils . It was early surmised that these layers were deposited under interglacial conditions and that their cyclical downcore occurrence could be correlated to the global benthic oxygen isotope curve. However, the synchronicity of Mn layers with interglacial conditions and the underlying mechanisms responsible for their formation remain controversial. Here we compile and synthesize findings of the last decades with several recent studies that shed light on issues such as the sources of Mn to the Arctic Ocean, the processes and pathways for Mn to the deep sea, the chemical processes active in the sediment, and the spatial and temporal distribution of Mn-rich layers in Arctic deep marine sediments . Budget calculations show that about 90% of Mn input to the Arctic Ocean originates from Arctic rivers or coastal erosion , two sources effectively shut down during mid- to late Quaternary glacial intervals by continental ice sheets blocking or re-directing the rivers and vast subaerial exposure of the shelf areas. Thus, the strong late Quaternary interglacial-glacial cyclicity in Mn content is clearly an input-related signal, and only secondarily influenced by chemical processes in the water column and in the sediment. On the shelves, the Mn undergoes repeated geochemical recycling caused by the high organic carbon content in the sediments before it is ultimately exported to the deep basins where scavenging processes in the water column effectively bring the Mn to the sea floor in the form of Mn (oxyhydr)oxides. The close synchronicity with enhanced bioturbation and elevated micro and nannofossil abundances shows that the Mn peaks are preserved at a stratigraphic level closely corresponding to the interglacial intervals. However, under certain biogeochemical conditions, Mn (oxyhydr)oxides may diagenetically become both dissolved and re-precipitated deep in the sediments, as shown by pore water analyses and X-ray radiograph studies. Dissolution is particularly conspicuous in late Quaternary sediments from the Lomonosov Ridge, where in rapidly deposited coarse grained intervals (diamictons) with elevated total organic carbon (TOC) contents, Mn appears almost completely removed from within the glacial sediments , and also the surrounding interglacial sediments. Correspondingly, bundles of closely spaced, mm-thick, Mn-rich horizontal bands are observed in sediment otherwise devoid of indicators for interglacial conditions, suggesting that these bands were purely formed by diagenetic processes redistributing the Mn from deeper sediment layers. This type of diagenetic Mn redistribution within the sediment can be recognized in XRF-core scanner data combined with sedimentological information from X-ray radiographs, while pore water data are highly promising if clear diagenetic features in the sediment are missing. With this increasing ability to recognize intervals where a diagenetic overprint exists in the Mn record, the recently improved understanding of the Mn cycle in the Arctic Ocean provides a conceptual paleoenvironmental framework in which carefully applied Mn stratigraphy can provide a powerful correlation tool, when combined with other paleoceanographic proxies and sedimentological data. ]\n","917\n","iteracion 918\n","[ Biotic control of harmful algal blooms (HABs): A brief review ]\n","918\n","[ Highlights Harmful algal blooms in water bodies occur due to eutrophication.

The main reason for the flourishing of blooms depends on the eutrophication . Blooms could be toxic as well as non-toxic, depending on the bloom-forming species.

Market-based instruments stimulate autonomous climate adaptation. International experience of MBIs provides positive and negative lessons. MBIs that are unattractive today may become feasible in the future. , Climate change creates challenges for developments in coastal and delta areas. The risks are reduced more effectively if both planned and autonomous adaptations take place. Flood risk management is dominated by planned adaptation, which is primarily command-and-control in nature, e.g. spatial planning and engineered flood defenses. If autonomous adaptation is downplayed people are more likely to make land-use choices that collectively lead to increasing flood risks while leaving the costs of adaptation and land scarcity with governments. Unless governments provide stimuli, autonomous adaptation in flood-prone areas is unlikely to happen due to spatial externalities, path-dependency and time lag between private investment decisions and consequences. This paper reviews the theory and practice of using market-based instruments (MBIs) for flood-risk management as means for autonomous climate change adaptation. While the use of MBIs for climate change mitigation is widely discussed, systematized reviews of various MBIs for climate change adaptation are rare. Yet, international experience shows that such measures as preferential taxes, non-perverse subsidies, flood insurance, marketable permits and transferable development rights can engage local stakeholders and provide price signals that stimulate individual adaptation. MBIs combined with command-based instruments help policy-makers to guide developments in flood-prone zone by affecting individual behavior via market forces. As adverse consequences of climate change become more pronounced locally, quantity-based MBIs unfeasible at present should become more attractive. Price-based MBIs that are currently employed could be designed to strategically account for increasing climate-induced flood and erosion probabilities in coastal and delta areas. ]\n","920\n","iteracion 921\n","[ Marine sediment toxicity: A focus on micro- and mesocosms towards remediation ]\n","921\n","[ Highlights M-cosms provide a link between observational field studies and natural environment.

Approximately 6000 traumatized men, women and children – terrified of the sea – refused to return to live or work in their rural, coastal villages, which in turn has had broad consequences for humanitarian emergency relief distribution networks and early recovery planning efforts. Researchers came from all over the world to participate in the UNESCO International Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Samoa International Tsunami Survey Team (ITST). Focusing on the need for interdisciplinary research, for the first time, a social impact assessment team (SIT) was expressly invited to participate. Within days of the tsunami, a group of Australian, New Zealand, American, Fijian, and Japanese disaster researchers began to discuss how they might develop a social science reconnaissance research plan using innovative approaches and best practice. This paper presents an overview of challenges faced by the social impact assessment team with a focus on lessons to be learnt from this experience. We discuss the need to clarify project boundaries, develop a core research agenda and project milestones, and develop day-to-day fieldwork work plans and at the same time be sensitive to the emotional needs of the interviewees as well as the researchers. We also make several practical suggestions for future social reconnaissance research with a set of recommendations to support disaster researchers as they plan their own research projects. The inclusion of a social impacts assessment group within a UNESCO-IOC ITST was a valuable response to the increasing need for responsible social research in sensitive topics of post-disaster analysis. Social scientists are aware that disaster social science research should not be a risk to the public, and that misconduct in such work should be avoided as far as possible. We believe that the inclusion of social science experts will revolutionise conceptual, methodological and empirical approaches in future ITSTs. Social scientists will provide unprecedented volumes of high quality information on post-disaster movements, communication and response activities by individuals, communities, private and public sectors — because social scientists are concerned about the integrity of the research process and results.

The patterns of change of other climatic drivers are difficult to predict (e.g., river flows and storm surges). Projected increased winter river flows throughout UK catchments will enhance the risks of coastal eutrophication , harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in some contexts, although there are spatial variabilities in river flow projections. The reproductive success of estuarine biota is sensitive to saline intrusion and corresponding turbidity maxima, which are projected to gradually shift landwards as a result of sea-level rise. Although more-frequent flushing events in winter and longer periods of drought in summer are predicted, whereby the subsequent estuarine mixing and recovery rates are poorly understood. With rising estuarine salinities , subtidal species can penetrate deeper into estuaries , although this will depend on the resilience/adaptation of the species. Many climate and impact predictions lack resolution and spatial cover. Long-term monitoring and increased research, which considers the catchment-river-estuary-coast system as a whole, is needed to support risk predicting and mitigatory strategies. ]\n","927\n","iteracion 928\n","[ A review of the shelf-slope circulation along Australia’s southern shelves: Cape Leeuwin to Portland ]\n","928\n","[ A review is presented of the ocean circulation along Australia’s southern shelves and slope. Uniquely, the long, zonal shelf is subject to an equatorward Sverdrup transport that gives rise to the Flinders Current – a small sister to the world’s major Western Boundary Currents. The Flinders Current is strongest near the 600 m isobath where the current speeds can reach 20 cm/s and the bottom boundary layer is upwelling favourable. It is larger in the west but likely intermittent in both space and time due to possibly opposing winds, thermohaline circulation and mesoscale eddies. The Flinders Current may be important to deep upwelling within the ubiquitous canyons of the region. During winter, the Leeuwin Current and local winds act to drive eastward currents that average up to 20–30 cm/s. The currents associated with the intense coastal-trapped wave-field (6–12 day band) are of order 25–30 cm/s and can peak at 80–90 cm/s. Wintertime winds and cooling also lead to downwelling to depths of 200 m or more and the formation of dense coastal water within the Great Australian Bight and the South Australian Sea. Within the Great Australian Bight, the thermohaline circulation associated with this dense water is unknown, but may enhance the eastward shelf-edge, South Australian Current. The dense salty water formed within Spencer Gulf is known to cascade as a gravity current to depths of 200 m off Kangaroo Island. This dense water outflow and meanders in the shelf circulation also fix the locations of a sequence of quasi-permanent mesoscale eddies between the Eyre Peninsula and Portland. During summer, the average coastal winds reverse and surface heating leads to the formation of warm water in the western Great Australian Bight and the South Australian Sea. No significant exchange of shelf water and gulf water appears to occur due to the presence of a dense, nutrient-rich (sub-surface) pool that is upwelled off Kangaroo Island. The winds lead to weak average coastal currents (&lt;10 cm/s) that flow to the north-west. In the Great Australian Bight, the wind stress curl can lead to an anticyclonic circulation gyre that can result in shelf-break downwelling in the western Great Australian Bight and the formation of the eastward, South Australian Current. In the east, upwelling favourable winds and coastal-trapped waves can lead to deep upwelling events off Kangaroo Island and the Bonney Coast that occur over 3–10 days and some 2–4 times a season. The alongshore currents here can be large (∼40 cm/s) and the vertical scales of upwelling are of order 150 m (off Kangaroo Island) and 250 m (off the Bonney Coast). Increasing evidence suggests that El Nino events (4–7 year period) can have a major impact on the winter and summer circulation. These events propagate from the Pacific Ocean and around the shelf-slope wave-guide of West Australia and into the Great Australian Bight. During winter El Nino events, the average shelf currents may be largely shut-down. During summer, the thermocline may be raised by up to 150 m. The nature and role of tides and surface waves is also discussed along with uncertainties in the general circulation and future research. ]\n","928\n","iteracion 929\n","[ Chapter 1 The Role of Sea Ice in Arctic and Antarctic Polynyas ]\n","929\n","[ Polynyas are persistent and recurrent regions of open water and/or thin ice or reduced ice concentration, tens to tens of thousands of square kilometers in areal extent, that occur within the sea ice zones of both hemispheres at locations where a more consolidated and thicker ice cover would be climatologically expected. Rather than simply constituting recurrent “windows” in the sea ice, polynyas are profoundly affected by, and intimately linked to, local and even regional ice conditions (i.e., the “icescape”). They respond sensitively to thermodynamic and dynamic forcing by the ocean and atmosphere and entail ecologically important “oases” that enable birds and mammals to overwinter at high latitudes and encourage enhanced primary production in the spring. In this review, we introduce the concept of polynyas from the perspective of the sea ice conditions/processes that define them. We discuss the unique characteristics of polynyas in both polar regions, and assess their possible response/contribution to climate variability and change.

We critically discuss existing work from freshwater and marine systems, laboratory studies and microbial batch culture experiments aiming to deduce common characteristics of the mineral's occurrence, and the processes governing its formation. Vivianite regularly occurs in close association with organic remains in iron-rich sediments. Simultaneously, it is a biogenic mineral product of metal reducing bacteria. These findings suggest that vivianite nucleation in natural systems is directed by the activity of such bacteria and crystal growth is particularly favoured within protected microzones. Taking into account recent findings from coastal marine sediments where vivianite authigenesis has been shown to be coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of methane, small-scale microbially mediated reactions appear to be crucial for the formation of vivianite. Small-scale heterogeneity within the sediment matrix may also explain why saturation calculations based upon bulk pore water constitutions often fail to accurately predict the occurrence of the mineral. Vivianite is not restricted to a specific trophic state of a system. The mineral forms in oligotrophic- as well as in eutrophic waters. However, depending on the iron inventory, the production, supply and degradation of organic matter determine the relative contribution of iron sulphide formation to the iron pool, and the concentration of inorganic phosphate and Fe 2 + in pore waters. Thus, vivianite authigenesis is also governed by bulk chemical conditions such as the rate of sulphide formation relative to that of Fe 2 + production. This situation allows stimulation of vivianite formation by iron supplementation aimed at restoring eutrophic lakes. Recent results from coastal marine sediments suggest that vivianite authigenesis is of significance for P burial in the marine realm. Vivianite authigenesis is likely important at the global scale, but has so far largely been ignored. ]\n","930\n","iteracion 931\n","[ Fisheries resources of Bangladesh: Present status and future direction ]\n","931\n","[ Bangladesh is considered one of the most suitable regions for fisheries in the world, with the world's largest flooded wetland and the third largest aquatic biodiversity in Asia after China and India.

Magnetite chemistry has been used as a petrogenetic indicator to identify the geological environment of ore formation and as a fingerprint of the source reservoir of iron. In this study, we present new textural and microanalytical EPMA and LA-ICP-MS data of magnetite from Carmen, Fresia, Mariela and El Romeral IOA deposits located in the Cretaceous Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile. We also provide a comprehensive summary and discussion of magnetite geochemistry from Andean IOAs including Los Colorados, Cerro Negro Norte, El Romeral (Chilean Iron Belt) and the Pliocene El Laco IOA deposit located in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Chilean Andes. Microtextures coupled with geochemical data were used to define and characterize the occurrence of different magnetite types. Magnetite exhibits a variety of textural features including oscillatory zoning, colloform banding, re-equilibration textures, exsolution lamellae and symplectites. The magmatic vs. hydrothermal origin of the different magnetite types and the evolution of IOA deposits can be assessed using diagrams based on compatible trace elements. However, magnetite is very susceptible to hydrothermal alteration and to both textural and compositional re-equilibration during magmatic and superimposed hydrothermal events. Based on the data presented here, we conclude that V and Ga are possibly the most reliable compatible elements in magnetite to trace ore-forming processes in the Andean IOA deposits. Magnetite chemistry reveals different conditions/events of formation for each IOA deposit ranging from high-temperature, low-oxygen fugacity ( ƒ O 2 ), purely magmatic (&gt;600 °C) conditions; to lower temperature and higher ƒ O 2 magmatic-hydrothermal (300–600 °C) to low-temperature hydrothermal (&lt;200–300 °C) conditions. Specifically, a continuous transition from high-temperature, low- ƒ O 2 conditions in the deepest portions of the deposits to low-temperature, relatively higher ƒ O 2 conditions towards surface are described for magnetite from El Laco. The new and compiled magnetite data from IOA deposits from the Chilean Iron Belt and El Laco are consistent with a transition from magmatic to hydrothermal conditions. The flotation model plausibly explains such features, which result from the crystallization of magnetite microlites from a silicate melt, nucleation and coalescence of aqueous fluid bubbles on magnetite surfaces, followed by ascent of a fluid-magnetite suspension along reactivated transtensional faults or through fissures formed during the collapse of the volcanic structure (El Laco). The decompression of the coalesced fluid-magnetite aggregates during ascent promotes the continued growth of magnetite microlites from the Fe-rich magmatic-hydrothermal fluid. As with any general genetic model, the flotation model allows variation and the definition of different styles or subtypes of IOA mineralization . The deeper, intrusive-like Los Colorados deposit shows contrasting features when compared with the Cerro Negro Norte hydrothermal type, the pegmatitic apatite-rich deposits of Carmen, Fresia and Mariela, and the shallow, subaerial deposits of El Laco. These apparent differences depend fundamentally on the depth of formation, the presence of structures and faults that trigger decompression, the composition of the host rocks, and the source and flux rate of hydrothermal fluids . ]\n","932\n","iteracion 933\n","[ The environmental interactions of tidal and wave energy generation devices ]\n","933\n","[ Global energy demand continues to grow and tidal and wave energy generation devices can provide a significant source of renewable energy.

In these ecosystems, the combination of seasonal changes in hydrology as well as the presence of coastal forests provides a greater biotope diversity, food and shelter for many fish species. Currently, however, deforestation, pollution and exotic species invasions impact the system's hydrology, water quality ultimately changing fish assemblage composition. In this paper, we describe the current status of fish diversity in the forested coastal streams of south-eastern Nigerian based on recent collections and data drawn from selected scientific publications.

Impacts of oil toxicity on the environment and exposed populations is variable and deleterious. Different factors including overlapping governance structure, stakeholder conflict, funding and lack of expertise is a challenge to land contamination remediation. Bioremediation is a potential approach to effective and efficient clean-up given its low greenhouse emissions and environmental footprints. , Contamination of the total environment (air, soil, water and biota) by crude oil has become a paramount interest in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Studies have revealed variable impacts of oil toxicity on the environment and exposed populations. The revelation gained much international attention in 2011 with the release of Environmental Assessment of Ogoniland report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). This has up scaled local and international pressures for urgent clean-up and restoration of degraded bio-resource rich environments of the Niger Delta, starting from Ogoniland. Previous remediation attempts in the area had failed due to erroneous operational conclusions (such as conclusions by oil industry operators that the Niger Delta soil is covered by a layer of clay and as such oil percolation remains within the top soil and makes remediation by enhanced natural attenuation (RENA) suitable for the region) and the adoption of incompatible and ineffective approaches (i.e. RENA) for the complex and dynamic environments. Perennial conflicts, poor regulatory oversights and incoherent standards are also challenges. Following UNEP recommendations, the Federal Government of Nigeria recently commissioned the clean-up and remediation of Ogoniland project; it would be novel and trend setting. While UNEP outlined some measures of contaminated land remediation, no specific approach was identified to be most effective for the Niger Delta region. Resolving the technical dilemma and identified social impediments is the key success driver of the above project. In this paper, we reviewed the socio-economic and ecological impacts of contaminated land in the Niger Delta region and the global state-of-the-art remediation approaches. We use coastal environment clean-up case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of bioremediation (sometimes in combination with other technologies) for remediating most of the polluted sites in the Niger Delta. Bioremediation should primarily be the preferred option considering its low greenhouse gas and environmental footprints, and low-cost burden on the weak and overstretched economy of Nigeria. ]\n","935\n","iteracion 936\n","[ Global climate change and human health: Pathways and possible solutions ]\n","936\n","[ Highlights Climate change affects health via natural disasters and socioeconomic pathways.

They record the development on the present-day northeastern side of the Mesoproterozoic Belt Basin of a carbonate platform early in the basin history while it was still relatively deep. The Waterton–Altyn succession documents a shallowing-upward, westward-prograding, broadly ramp-style platform composed of mixed carbonate–siliciclastic sediments. Five main facies types are recognized: Laminite, Ribbon, Grainstone , Oolite and Stromatolite . The first two were formed of lime muds deposited on the ramp and outer platform under low-energy conditions. The Grainstone facies consists of sand-sized peloids, aggregates and intraclasts plus admixed quartz and feldspar sand, microspar grains, radial ooids and silicified oolite and anhydrite . The Oolite facies is dominated by ooids with a concentric cortex. These are allochthonous coarse-grained particles interpreted to have been transported westward to a marginal belt and outer platform mainly by tsunami off-surge from the platform interior, coastal sand shoals and tidal-flat sabkhas , outcrops of which are not preserved. Absence of hummocky or swaley cross-stratification suggests that the platform was not affected by strong storms. Instead, flat-pebble conglomerates on the ramp are ascribed to episodic, tsunami-induced wave action which caused localized rupture and imbrication of flat pebbles. Scouring by tsunami off-surge produced intraclasts in the outer platform. There, this sediment lay undisturbed, but in the shallower marginal belt it was reworked by strong tidal currents which generated variably directed cross-lamination from dune and ripple migration and, locally, large sand bars with northwest-dipping clinoforms. Deformation features caused by synsedimentary earthquakes are common, with the various seismite types reflecting the facies-specific rheology of the sediment. Seismites in the lower Altyn Formation appear not to be linked to individual tsunami-lain dolograinstone beds in the outer platform, suggesting that these two sets of features were not generated by the same faults. The carbonate factory shut down when the platform was suffocated by siliciclastic mud sourced from the west, and tidal activity diminished as the whole basin shallowed. The interpretation of the carbonate platform presented herein is radically different from previous views that considered the Waterton and Altyn formations to be predominantly of shallow-subtidal and tidal-flat origin. These rocks are relevant to the appreciation of other carbonate platforms, especially in that tsunamis may be an under-appreciated agent of erosion and sediment transport offshore. ]\n","937\n","iteracion 938\n","[ An ecosystem approach to kelp aquaculture in the Americas and Europe ]\n","938\n","[ Highlights The kelp farming industry in Maine (USA) was used as a model to assess nascent kelp aquaculture outside Asia.

Recommendations considering both social and ecological factors are proposed for more sustainable growth of kelp aquaculture. , Kelp farming is increasing along the temperate coastlines of the Americas and Europe. The economic, ecological, and social frameworks surrounding kelp farming in these new areas are in contrast with the conditions of progenitor kelp farming regions in China, Japan, and Korea. Thus, identifying and addressing the environmental and social impacts of kelp farming in these regions is vital to ensuring the industry’s long-term sustainability. Here, a conceptual model of the human and natural systems supporting this nascent kelp aquaculture sector was developed using Maine, USA as a focal region. Potential negative impacts of kelp aquaculture were identified to be habitat degradation, overfishing of wild seeds, predation and competition with wild fish and genes, and transmission of diseases. Increased food security, improved restoration efforts, greater fisheries productivity, and alternative livelihoods development were determined to be potential positive impacts of kelp aquaculture. Changes in biodiversity and productivity resulting from either negative or positive impacts of kelp aquaculture were confirmed to have downstream effects on local fisheries and coastal communities. Recommendations to improve or protect the ecosystem services tangential to kelp farming include: define ecosystem and management boundaries, assess ecosystem services and environmental carrying capacity, pursue ecologically and socially considerate engineering, and protect the health and genetic diversity of wild kelp beds. Recommendations to ensure that kelp farming improves the well-being of all stakeholders include: increase horizontal expansion, expand and teach Best Management Practices, and develop climate change resiliency.

Because the Baltic Sea is a semi- enclosed basin, winds from favorable directions blowing predominately parallel to the coast cause upwelling leading to vertical displacement of the water body and mixing. During the thermal stratified period, upwelling can lead to a strong sea-surface temperature drop of more than 10 °C changing drastically the thermal balance and stability conditions at the sea-surface. Upwelling can play a key role in replenishing the euphotic zone with the nutritional components necessary for biological productivity when the surface layer is depleted of nutrients. Consequently, it has been found out that in such areas where upwelling lifts phosphorus-rich deep water to the surface, the N/P ratio becomes low which favors the blooming of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae. The rapid temperature decrease during such events was recognized and documented a long time ago when temperature measurements became available. Thus, the study of the upwelling process has a long tradition. However, although the importance of upwelling has generally been accepted for the Baltic Sea, no general review of upwelling exists.

As catadromous fishes , anguillid eels spend most of their lives in freshwater until they return to their spawning grounds in the tropics, although part of the population never enters freshwater and instead resides in brackish and marine areas close to coastlines. Molecular phylogenetic research suggests that anguillid eels originated from deep-ocean midwater marine anguilliform species and that tropical eels originating from the Indo-Pacific region are the most basal species of anguillid eels. Anguillid eels left the tropical ocean to colonize temperate areas. The yearly spawning of tropical species and constant larval growth throughout the year extend to periods of recruitment in continental habitats to last all year for tropical eels. Tropical eels such as A. celebesensis and A. borneensis have relatively short migrations periods of less than 100 km to their spawning grounds. Conversely, the temperate European eel A. anguilla travels the longest distances and migrates more than 5000 km across the Atlantic Ocean to spawn in the Sargasso Sea. The ancestral state of migration in the genus Anguilla may have been local, short-scale and nonseasonal spawning migration throughout the year as defined in tropical eels. With the expansion of dispersion of global oceanic migration across the world, migration scales can gradually change. Temperate anguillid eels migrate thousands of kilometres from spawning areas to coastal and inland water habitats while retaining spawning areas in tropical areas, accompanied by seasonal downstream and spawning migrations with consequences for seasonal recruitment. Recent advances and the availability of electronic tags such as pop-up satellite archival tag could reconstruct the entire spawning migration from continental growth habitats to spawning sites with detailed migration behaviours and routes. Migration ecology and mechanisms throughout the life of anguillid eels have gradually been revealed in recent decades. ]\n","944\n","iteracion 945\n","[ Research Advances in Ion Channel-based Electrochemical Sensing Techniques ]\n","945\n","[ During the past few years, the electrochemical sensing techniques based on ion channels have attracted considerable attention.

Deltas play a central role in food and water security but are increasingly facing hazards such as submergence, riverine and coastal flooding, and coastal erosion. This paper synthesizes efforts of the Belmont Forum Deltas project, an international network of interdisciplinary research collaboration with focal areas in the Mekong, the Ganges Brahmaputra, and the Amazon deltas. The inherent complexity and dearth of knowledge about deltas require disciplinary expertise to advance jointly with interdisciplinary collaboration. An overarching research framework articulates focal research areas and collaborative modules, serving as an umbrella for both crosscutting and specific research questions. These modules have allowed for common definition of goals, responsibilities, and products, but flexible and decentralized disciplinary and interdisciplinary collaborations. Self-organization within and across areas of expertise has proven effective in bringing collaborators to commit to specific efforts. Knowledge co-production workshops focusing on vulnerability and risk have successfully strengthened interactions with regional organizations. As a distributed network, challenges remain in terms of type of and level of interaction and hands-on collaborative work among research partners, including joint fieldwork, but successes far outweigh difficulties. To illustrate these points, we present a review of three research domains built upon different arrangements of disciplinary and interdisciplinary collaborations: advancing biophysical classifications of deltas, understanding deltas as coupled social–ecological systems, and analyzing and informing social and environmental vulnerabilities in delta regions. ]\n","947\n","iteracion 948\n","[ The bioeconomy in Italy and the new national strategy for a more competitive and sustainable country ]\n","948\n","[ Highlights Italian bioeconomy is re-connecting national economy with environment and society.

Its sectors of excellence are food and biobased products, and it is a consistent presence in research and innovation projects funded by the EU Horizon 2020 programme (Societal Challenges 2) and the European Public Private Partnership “Biobased industry” (BBI-JU). The bioeconomy reduces dependence on fossil fuels and finite materials, loss of biodiversity and changing land use. It contributes to environmental regeneration, spurs economic growth and supports jobs in rural, coastal and abandoned industrial areas, leveraging local contexts and traditions. In 2017 the Italian government promoted the development of a national Bioeconomy Strategy (BIT), recently updated (BIT II) to interconnect more efficiently the pillars of the national bioeconomy: production of renewable biological resources, their conversion into valuable food/feed, biobased products and bio-energy, and transformation and valorization of bio-waste streams. BIT II aims to improve coordination between Ministries and Italian regions in alignment of policies, regulations, R&amp;I funding programmes and infrastructures investment. The goal is a 15 % increase in turnover and employment in the Italian bioeconomy by 2030. Based on Italy’s strategic geopolitical position in the Mediterranean basin, BIT II also includes actions to improve sustainable productivity, social cohesion and political stability through the implementation of bioeconomy strategies in this area. This paper provides an insight into these strategies and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the sectors involved and the measures, regulatory initiatives and monitoring actions undertaken. ]\n","948\n","iteracion 949\n","[ High-resolution survey of tidal energy towards power generation and influence of sea-level-rise: A case study at coast of New Jersey, USA ]\n","949\n","[ The first and a crucial step in development of tidal power , which is now attracting more and more attention worldwide, is a reliable survey of temporal and spatial distribution of tidal energy along coastlines.

In view of the needs in actual development of tidal power generation and sensitivity of tidal power to flow speed, the former being proportional to the third power of the latter, a high-resolution and detailed modeling is desired. Data with best available accuracy for coastlines, bathymetry , tributaries, etc. are used, meshes as fine as 20 m and less for the whole NJ coast are generated, and the unstructured grid finite volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM) and high performance computing (HPC) facilities are employed. Besides comparison with observation data, a series of numerical tests have been made to ensure reliability of the modeling results. A detailed tidal energy distribution and a list of top sites for tidal power are presented. It is shown that indeed sea-level-rise (SLR) affects the tidal energy distribution significantly. With SLR of 0.5 m and 1 m, tidal energy in NJ coastal waters increases by 21% and 43%, respectively, and the number of the top sties tends to decrease along the barrier islands facing the Atlantic Ocean and increase in the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River.

Countries with coastal regions have the advantage of the ability to utilize an extra source of renewable energy, that is, the energy from ocean waves. However, one of the major problems with wave energy is that it is location dependent, where many factors that increase its utilization potential are dependent on the feasibility of the locations. There is a lack of objective, relative and cognitive methods for the estimation of location suitability for ocean wave energy production. The present study attempts to address this lacuna and proposes a new method which is both objective and cognitive to identify suitable locations where the optimal amount of wave energy can be produced.

Aspects of the ecology of species noted during this study are summarized and the results of previous researches are incorporated. Small and large-scale environmental factors (swash and surf climate, depth, temperature, day–night and seasonal cycles) contributed significantly to population distributions. All Schistomysis populations are characterized by faster individual growth and earlier maturity at higher temperature, resulting in intensive recruitment during spring or summer seasons in combination with higher fecundity of genitors. Regarding productivity, our production and P / B ¯ P / B ¯ estimates ranged between 2255–26,321 mg AFDW/100 m 3 /year and 6.09–9.73, respectively. These production values are similar to those found for comparable marine mysids with two or three generations per year. The observed demographic heterogeneity and production of populations has ecological implications in the Bay of Biscay and Mediterranean areas, where Schistomysis species are dominant components of littoral and shelf suprabenthic communities. ]\n","951\n","iteracion 952\n","[ Existing strategies for managing mangrove dominated muddy coasts: Knowledge gaps and recommendations ]\n","952\n","[ Highlights Existing strategies for managing mangrove dominated muddy coasts were classified and reviewed for their effectiveness.

We summarize the underlying physiological responses of seagrass species, the potential utility of various parameters as indicators of nutrient enrichment in seagrasses, the relatively sparse available information about environmental conditions that exacerbate eutrophication effects, and the better known array of indirect stressors imposed by nutrient over-enrichment that influence seagrass growth and survival. Seagrass recovery following nutrient reductions is examined, as well as the status of modeling efforts to predict seagrass response to changing nutrient regimes. The most common mechanism invoked or demonstrated for seagrass decline under nutrient over-enrichment is light reduction through stimulation of high-biomass algal overgrowth as epiphytes and macroalgae in shallow coastal areas, and as phytoplankton in deeper coastal waters. Direct physiological responses such as ammonium toxicity and water-column nitrate inhibition through internal carbon limitation may also contribute. Seagrass decline under nutrient enrichment appears to involve indirect and feedback mechanisms, and is manifested as sudden shifts in seagrass abundance rather than continuous, gradual changes in parallel with rates of increased nutrient additions. Depending on the species, interactions of high salinity , high temperature, and low light have been shown to exacerbate the adverse effects of nutrient over-enrichment. An array of indirect effects of nutrient enrichment can accelerate seagrass disappearance, including sediment re-suspension from seagrass loss, increased system respiration and resulting oxygen stress, depressed advective water exchange from thick macroalgal growth, biogeochemical alterations such as sediment anoxia with increased hydrogen sulfide concentrations, and internal nutrient loading via enhanced nutrient fluxes from sediments to the overlying water. Indirect effects on trophic structure can also be critically important, for example, the loss of herbivores, through increased hypoxia/anoxia and other habitat shifts, that would have acted as “ecological engineers” in promoting seagrass survival by controlling algal overgrowth; and shifts favoring exotic grazers that out-compete seagrasses for space. Evidence suggests that natural seagrass population shifts are disrupted, slowed or indefinitely blocked by cultural eutrophication, and there are relatively few known examples of seagrass meadow recovery following nutrient reductions. Reliable biomarkers as early indicators of nutrient over-enriched seagrass meadows would benefit coastal resource managers in improving protective measures. Seagrasses can be considered as “long-term\" integrators (days to weeks) of nutrient availability, especially through analyses of their tissue content, and of activities of enzymes such as nitrate reductase and alkaline phosphatase . The ratio of leaf nitrogen content to leaf mass has also shown promise as a “nutrient pollution indicator” for the seagrass Zostera marina , with potential application to other species. In modeling efforts, seagrass response to nutrient loading has proven difficult to quantify beyond localized areas because long-term data consistent in quality are generally lacking, and high inter-annual variability in abundance and productivity depending upon stochastic meteorological and hydrographic conditions. Efforts to protect remaining seagrass meadows from damage and loss under eutrophication, within countries and across regions, are generally lacking or weak and ineffective. Research needs to further understand about seagrasses and eutrophication should emphasize experimental studies to assess the response of a wider range of species to chronic, low-level as well as acute, pulsed nutrient enrichment. These experiments should be conducted in the field or in large-scale mesocosms following appropriate acclimation , and should emphasize factor interactions (N, P, C; turbidity ; temperature; herbivory) to more closely simulate reality in seagrass ecosystems. They should scale up to address processes that occur over larger scales, including food-web dynamics that involve highly mobile predators and herbivores. Without any further research, however, one point is presently very clear: Concerted local and national actions, thus far mostly lacking, are needed worldwide to protect remaining seagrass meadows from accelerating cultural eutrophication in rapidly urbanizing coastal zones. ]\n","955\n","iteracion 956\n","[ Changing perspectives of mangrove management in India – An analytical overview ]\n","956\n","[ Highlights Strategies for mangrove management in India have been analyzed from the past.

Although they have annually delivered ~ 2000 × 10 9 kg of sediment to the ocean since 1000 yr BP, they presently contribute only ~ 600 × 10 9 kg/yr, which is reverting to a level typical of the relatively undisturbed watersheds before the rise in human activities in East and Southeast Asia at 2000 yr BP. During the most recent decades flow regulation by dams and sediment entrapment by reservoirs, as well as human-influenced soil erosion in the river basins, have sharply reduced the sediment delivered from the large river basins to the ocean. We constructed a time series of data on annual water discharges and sediment fluxes from these large rivers to the western Pacific Ocean covering the period 1950–2008. These data indicate that the short-term (interannual scale) variation of sediment flux is dominated by natural climatic oscillations such as the El Niño/La Niña cycle and that anthropogenic causes involving dams and land use control the long-term (decadal scale) decrease in sediment flux to the ocean. In contrast to the relatively slow historical increase in sediment flux during the period 2000–1000 yr BP, the recent sediment flux has been decreased at an accelerating rate over centennial scales. The alterations of these large river systems by both natural and anthropogenic forcing present severe environmental challenges in the coastal ocean, including the sinking of deltas and declines in coastal wetland areas due to the decreasing sediment supply. Our work thus provides a regional perspective on the large river-derived sediment flux to the ocean over millennial and decadal scales, which will be important for understanding and managing the present and future trends of delivery of terrigenous sediment to the ocean in the context of global change. ]\n","957\n","iteracion 958\n","[ Climate change impacts on water salinity and health ]\n","958\n","[ It is estimated that 884 million people do not have access to clean drinking water in the world.

Subcategories are discussed largely in terms of estuaries , lakes and reservoirs. The term fetch-limited refers to basins that are small enough that distance rather than wind duration is always a limitation to wave generation. Attention is focused on basins where fetch distances are &lt; 50 km. The dimensions of small basins provide a limit on the energy potential of the waves, causing geologic and biologic controls to be more significant and wind-induced currents, tidal currents and ice to be relatively more effective than on exposed beaches. Shoreline orientations differ greatly over short distances, causing great differences in exposure to dominant winds and isolating beach segments. Limited longshore sediment exchanges result in beach sediments that closely resemble local source materials. The absence of high-energy waves causes beaches and bar forms to be smaller, and the absence of swell waves following storms and the relatively calm conditions reduces the speed of recovery of post-storm profiles and the cyclic nature of beach response. The beaches are often fronted by flat shallow platforms that undergo little morphologic change and help dissipate waves at low water levels. The narrow beaches are poor sources of sediment for wind-blown sand and dunes are small or frequently absent. The narrow beaches and reduced wave energies allow upland vegetation and algae and seagrass to grow close to the active foreshore. This vegetation, the wrack deposited on the beach, and driftwood logs are better able to resist the low-energy waves and are more effective in resisting beach change. Erosion rates of 2–3 m yr − 1 are common in some estuaries and can be &gt; 7 m yr − 1 . Rates of up to 1.5 m yr − 1 can occur in small lakes and reservoirs. Shore parallel protection structures are common and have greater survivability in low-energy environments than high-energy environments; they are cheaper to build; and they have been implemented more frequently to control erosion . Their effect has been to reduce the extent of beach in small water bodies. Beach nourishment projects have been fewer than on exposed shores and the quantities smaller. Many nourishment projects have been implemented for amenity value and have been placed in locations where waves have not been able to create an equilibrium landform . The biggest difference in process controls between estuaries and lakes and reservoirs is in the mechanism for water level change. Tides and surges from external basins are important on estuarine beaches, whereas rainfall, runoff, groundwater flow , evapotranspiration and control by dams are more important in reservoirs and lakes. Future sea level rise will threaten beach environments in estuaries where shore parallel walls will prevent onshore migration of landforms and habitats and will change the number and locations of beaches in unarmored areas. Dam removal will pose a threat to the existence of reservoirs and dammed lakes. Water levels are more dependent on human actions in lakes and reservoirs, so changes can be minimal or increased to a greater extent than in estuaries. Lesser stability and predictability of beaches will complicate future management efforts. ]\n","959\n","iteracion 960\n","[ The physical environment of the Peruvian upwelling system ]\n","960\n","[ Knowledge of the characteristics of the physical environment of the Peru coastal upwelling zone has increased greatly during the past decade. Observations made during 1976 and 1977, many made as part of the Coastal Upwelling Ecosystem Analysis JOINT-II expedition, provide the basis for an interpretative description of the physical processes and phenomena occurring in Peru coastal waters. Four important phenomena are discussed: wind-driven upwelling, the poleward undercurrent, surface mixed layer deepening, and low-frequency coastal-trapped waves. The coastal winds were invariably favorable for coastal upwelling, even during the 1976 El Niño. The agreement between the offshore transport in the relatively shallow (30 m) surface layer and the Ekman transport, deduced from the local wind, was good for both the mean and variable state. The agreement with the deeper onshore transport was less good, consistent with the marked three-dimensionally and spatial variability of the upwelling. The poleward undercurrent was apparently continuous from 5°S to at least 15°S, flowing just below the surface layer over the continental shelf and slope, and supplying the upwelling water. The variability in the alongshore velocity field was dominated by baroclinic free coastal-trapped waves with periods of 5–20 days. Although there is appreciable temporal and spatial variability in the Peru coastal upwelling system, the upwelling, the undercurrent, and the low-frequency coastal-trapped waves were ubiquitous. ]\n","960\n","iteracion 961\n","[ Changes in the hydrography of Central California waters associated with the 1997–98 El Niño ]\n","961\n","[ Oceanographic conditions off Central California were monitored by means of a series of 13 hydrographic cruises between February 1997 and January 1999, which measured water properties along an oceanographic section perpendicular to the California Coast. The 1997–98 El Niño event was defined by higher than normal sea levels at Monterey, which began in June 1997, peaked in November 1997, and returned to normal in March 1998. The warming took place in two distinct periods. During June and July 1997, the sea level increased as a result of stronger than normal coastal warming below 200 dbars and within 100 km of the coast, which was associated with poleward flow of saltier waters. During this period, deeper (400–1000 dbar) waters between 150–200 km from shore were also warmed and became more saline. Subsequently, sea level continued to rise through January 1998, mostly as a result of the warming above 200 dbars although, after a brief period of cooling in September 1997, waters below 200 dbar were also warmer than normal during this period. This winter warm anomaly was also coastally trapped, extending 200 km from shore and was accompanied by cooler and fresher water in the offshore California current. In March and April 1998, sea level dropped quickly to normal levels and inshore waters were fresher and warmer than the previous spring and flowed southward. The warming was consistent with equatorial forcing of Central California waters via propagation of Kelvin or coastally-trapped waves. The observed change in heat content associated with the 1997–98 El Niño was the same as that observed during the previous seasonal cycle. The warming and freshening events were similar to events observed during the 1957–58 and 1982–83 El Niños. ]\n","961\n","iteracion 962\n","[ The evolution of oceanic and atmospheric anomalies in the northeast Pacific during the El Niño and La Niña events of 1995–2001 ]\n","962\n","[ From late 1995 through early 2001, three major interannual climate events occurred in the tropical Pacific; the 1995–97 La Niña (LN), 1997–98 El Niño (EN), and 1998–2001 LN. We analyze atmospheric and upper oceanic anomalies in the northeast Pacific (NEP) during these events, and compare them to anomalies both elsewhere in the north and tropical Pacific, and to typical EN and LN anomaly patterns. The atmospheric and oceanic anomalies varied strongly on intraseasonal and interannual scales. During the 1995–97 LN and 1997–98 EN, the Northeast Pacific was dominated by negative SLP and cyclonic wind anomalies, and by upper ocean temperature and sea surface height (SSH) anomalies. The latter were positive along the North American west coast and in the NEP thermal anomaly pool (between Hawaii, Vancouver Island, and Baja California), and negative in the central north Pacific. This atmospheric/oceanic anomaly pattern is typical of EN. An eastward shift in the atmospheric teleconnection from east Asia created EN-like anomalies in the NEP during the 1995–97 LN, well before the 1997–98 EN had begun. The persistence of negative sea-level pressure (SLP) and cyclonic wind anomalies in the NEP during the 1997–98 EN intensified pre-existing upper oceanic anomalies. Atmospheric anomalies were shifted eastward during late 1996–early 1998, leading to a similar onshore shift of oceanic anomalies. This produced exceptionally strong positive upper ocean temperature and SSH anomalies along the west coast during the 1997–98 EN, and explains the unusual coastal occurrences of several species of large pelagic warm-water fishes. The growth and eastward shift of these pre-existing anomalies does not appear to have been linked to tropical Pacific EN anomalies until late 1997, when a clear atmospheric teleconnection between the two regions developed. Prior to this, remote atmospheric impacts on the NEP were primarily from east Asia. As the 1998–2001 LN developed, NEP anomalies began reversing toward the typical LN pattern. This led to predominantly negative SLP and cyclonic wind anomalies in the NEP, and upper ocean temperature and SSH anomalies that were mainly negative along the west coast and positive in the central north Pacific. The persistence of these anomalies into mid-2001, and a number of concurrent biological changes in the NEP, suggest that a decadal climate shift may have occurred in late 1998. During 1995–2001, NEP oceanic anomalies tracked the overlying atmospheric anomalies, as indicated by the maintenance of a characteristic spatial relationship between these anomalies. In particular, wind stress curl and SSH anomalies in the NEP maintained an inverse relationship that strengthened and shifted eastward toward the west coast during late 1996–early 1998. This consistent relationship indicates that anomalous Ekman transport driven by regional atmospheric forcing was an important contributor to temperature and SSH anomalies in the NEP and CCS during the 1997–98 EN. Other studies have shown that coastal propagations originating from the tropical Pacific also may have contributed to coastal NEP anomalies during this EN. Our results indicate that at least some of this coastal anomaly signal may have been generated by regional atmospheric forcing within the NEP. ]\n","962\n","iteracion 963\n","[ Quaternary sea-level history of the United States ]\n","963\n","[ Publisher This chapter provides an overview of some of the accomplishments in understanding Quaternary sea-level fluctuations as recorded on the coastlines of the United States and emphasizes on the sea-level record of the last interglacial complex.

This study presents the recent progress and achievements in the performance of FRP-concrete bond systems subjected to chloride exposure. The durability of epoxy resin, FRP composites and the FRP-concrete interface in immersion exposure and wet-dry cycle exposure is focused in this review. The mechanism of typical failure modes of FRP-concrete interface is further investigated. Moreover, the lower bound limit of the tensile property retention of epoxy resin and FRP composites is analyzed and compared with the published specifications. Finally, recommendations for future research are also presented. ]\n","966\n","iteracion 967\n","[ Fingerprinting and tracing the sources of soils and sediments: Earth and ocean science, geoarchaeological, forensic, and human health applications ]\n","967\n","[ Fine-grained sediment is perhaps the most widespread and pervasive contaminant in aquatic systems reflecting its role in influencing the quality of the water (e.g., turbidity , vector of chemicals and other pollutants) and its detrimental effect on infrastructure (e.g., dams, turbines) and aquatic habitats (e.g., salmonid spawning grounds) through sedimentation. Determining the sources of fine-grained sediment thus represents an important requirement for watershed and coastal management, as well as for understanding the evolution of landscapes and ocean basins. Sediment source fingerprinting utilizes the diagnostic physical, chemical and biological properties (i.e., tracers) of source materials to enable samples of collected sediment to be apportioned to these sources. This review examines the development of the technique within the earth and ocean sciences, focusing mainly on agricultural landscapes. However, the development of new tracers, such as compound-specific stable isotopes , has allowed the technique to be applied in a growing number of environmental settings including forested (including wildfire-impacted forests), urban and estuarine/coastal settings. This review also describes other applications of the fingerprinting approach such as geoarchaeological (e.g., archaeological site formation), forensic (e.g., identifying the sources of soil/sediment particles in criminal investigations) and human health (e.g., identifying the sources of airborne particulate matter , PM 2.5 ) applications. Identifying commonalities in methods and approaches between environments and disciplines should foster collaboration and the exchange of ideas. Furthermore, refinement of the sediment source fingerprinting technique requires that several methodological issues be addressed. These methodological issues range from the initial sampling design to the interpretation of the final apportionment results. This review also identifies and assesses these methodological concerns. ]\n","967\n","iteracion 968\n","[ Cenozoic magmatism of the Sierra Madre del Sur and tectonic truncation of the Pacific margin of southern Mexico ]\n","968\n","[ In southern Mexico, the Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS) preserves the record of a long-lived magmatic arc that vanished diachronically during Paleogene-early Miocene time, decreasing in age to the southeast. The magmatic record consists of a coastal plutonic belt dominated by granites and granodiorites with minor mafic and intermediate intrusions and an inland volcanic belt dominated by intermediate and silicic volcanic centers. The juxtaposition of the plutonic belt with the trench indicates the removal of most of the Paleogene forearc during the Oligocene . Abundant evidence indicates that subduction erosion played a significant role in the reconfiguration of the continental margin of southern Mexico following cessation of magmatism . This is evident in the subsidence of continental segments contiguous to the present trench and the loss of lower continental crust as inferred from the present shape of the wedge, as well as in the estimations of the former crustal thickness based on geobarometry of the exposed levels of plutonic complexes. The Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic decreasing age trend in the SMS shows three time intervals in which magmatism ceased at different rates. The general southeastward younging trend of magmatism, as well as the left-lateral shear zones of the central and coastal zones of the Sierra Madre del Sur, in combination with constraints imposed by the prevalent model of the Caribbean plate evolution have been invoked to consider the Chortís block as the removed segment during margin truncation. The main drawbacks of this model are the mismatch in the chronology of migmatitic complexes of northern Chortís and the Xolapa terrane in the continental margin of southern Mexico, and the presence of the Late Cretaceous to present unperturbed marine sequence in the Gulf of Tehuantepec in the assumed trajectory of the Chortís block. These considerations and the subduction erosion evidence suggest a more complex scenario than having Chortís juxtaposed immediately adjacent to the present-day margin. There are alternative possibilities to explain removal of the forearc, ranging from a western provenance for the Chortís block, as has been suggested in other models, to intermediate positions for Chortís with a more southern trajectory with respect to the present-day trench. Such a trajectory would leave a broad zone with shear strain structures more susceptible to removal by subduction erosion after the passage of the trench-trench transform triple junction . This would reconcile the evidence of subduction erosion and the indications of the northwestern provenance of the Chortís block. ]\n","968\n","iteracion 969\n","[ Anti-fouling polymeric membrane ion-selective electrodes ]\n","969\n","[ Highlights An overview on the advances in anti-fouling polymeric membrane ion-selective electrodes is presented.

Two delta lobe systems were built by the Daladel and Peccaïs channels, after which a deflected wave-influenced delta lobe was formed by the La Ville and Saint-Roman channels. The latest channel, the Rhone Vif channel, is skewed because this channel was completely canalized and engineered up to its mouth in the beginning of the 16th century. Since the avulsion of this channel about 1550 A.D., the coastline of the Petite Camargue has been especially affected by the influence of waves and currents. The spits replaced the beach ridges which juxtaposed themselves and have migrated westward since the 16th century. The formation of the western part of the delta in the last 2000 yr is affected by not only the fluvial sedimentary fluxes and the coastal dynamics to the mouth but also climatic change and human influence. ]\n","970\n","iteracion 971\n","[ Sustainable seawater desalination: Current status, environmental implications and future expectations ]\n","971\n","[ Highlights Freshwater scarcity throughout the globe necessitates renewed interest in seawater desalination Closely monitoring the adverse impacts of desalination on the environment paves the way to its safe growth in the future Transition to low carbon desalination ensures its sustainability Energy recovery methods and pressure loss suppression techniques play important roles in desalination economics Technologies at various levels of maturity are currently available to tackle many of the desalination challenges , Desalination is the process of making the saltwater of the Earth's oceans drinkable and could be a solution to droughts, especially in warmer and drier regions.

Multiple forms of physical, chemical and biological degradation affect the Mediterranean soils. Some Mediterranean soils are reaching critical limits for its ability to provide ecosystem services. A continuous and harmonised soil assessment is required to evaluate trends in soil degradation. , Soil, a non-renewable resource, sustains life on Earth by supporting around 95% of global food production and providing ecosystem services such as biomass production, filtration of contaminants and transfer of mass and energy between spheres. Unsustainable management practices and climate change are threatening the natural capital of soils, particularly in the Mediterranean region, where increasing population, rapid land-use changes, associated socio-economic activities and climate change are imposing high pressures on the region's shallow soils. Despite evidence of high soil susceptibility to degradation and desertification , the true extent of soil degradation in the region is unknown. This paper reviews and summarises the scientific literature and relevant official reports, with the aim to advance this knowledge by synthesizing, mapping, and identifying gaps regarding the status, causes, and consequences of soil degradation processes in the European Mediterranean region. This is needed as scientific underpinning of efforts to counteract soil degradation in the region. Three main degradation categories are then considered: physical (soil sealing, compaction, erosion), chemical (soil organic matter, contamination, salinisation), and biological. We find some degradation processes to be relatively well-documented (e.g. soil erosion), while others, such as loss of biodiversity, remain poorly addressed, with limited data availability. We suggest establishment of a continuous, harmonised soil monitoring system at national and regional scale in the Mediterranean region to provide comparable datasets and chart the spatial extent and temporal changes in soil degradation, and corresponding economic implications.

However, little is known about the role of tropical peatlands in the global carbon cycle. We therefore determine the past rates of carbon storage and release in the Indonesian peatlands of Kalimantan and Sumatra – the largest global concentration of tropical peatlands – since 20 ka (kiloannum before present). Using a novel GIS (geographic information system) approach we provide a spatially-explicit reconstruction of peatland expansion in a series of paleogeographic maps. Sea-level change is identified as the principal driver for peatland formation and expansion in western Indonesia as it controls both atmospheric moisture supply and the hydrological gradient on the islands. Initiation of inland peatlands in Kalimantan was coupled to periods of rapid deglacial sea-level rise with rates of over 10 mm yr −1 whereas coastal peatlands could only form after 7 ka when the rate of sea-level rise had slowed to 2.4 mm yr −1 . Falling sea levels after 5 ka led to rapid peatland expansion in coastal lowlands and a doubling of the total peatland area in western Indonesia to 131,500 km 2 between 2.3 ka and 0 ka. As a result of slow peatland expansion from 15 to 6 ka and rapid expansion afterwards the rate of annual carbon storage of all western Indonesian peatlands remained &lt;1 Tg C yr −1 until 6 ka and then increased to 7.2 Tg C yr −1 by 0 ka. Associated with this rise in carbon storage was an exponential growth of the peat carbon pool from 0.01 Pg C by 15 ka to 23.2 Pg C at present, of which 70% is stored in coastal peatlands. In inland Kalimantan peatlands, falling sea levels together with increased El Niño activity induced an annual carbon release of 0.15 Tg C yr −1 from aerobic peat decay since 2 ka. Cumulative carbon losses from anaerobic decomposition do not seem to limit peat bog growth in the tropical peatlands of Indonesia. Carbon losses from Holocene peat fires are only known from the Kutai basin since 4.4 ka with an associated release of 0.1–3.6 Tg C per fire event, which never surpassed the contemporaneous annual C storage. The peatlands of western Indonesia were thus a persistent carbon sink since 15 ka but this sink was of global importance only over the past 2000 years when it likely contributed to a slower growth in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. Currently, annual losses of carbon from peat drainage and fires are on average 28 times higher than the pre-disturbance rate of uptake implying that this carbon reservoir has recently switched from being a net carbon sink to a significant source of atmospheric carbon and is currently in danger of eradication. ]\n","974\n","iteracion 975\n","[ Tropical cyclone disaster management using remote sensing and spatial analysis: A review ]\n","975\n","[ Tropical cyclones and their often devastating impacts are common in many coastal areas across the world.

With a multitude of techniques and potential data types, it is very challenging to select the most appropriate processing techniques and datasets for managing cyclone disasters. This review provides guidance to select the most appropriate datasets and processing techniques for tropical cyclone disaster management. It reviews commonly used remote sensing and spatial analysis approaches and their applications for impacts assessment and recovery, risk assessment and risk modelling. The study recommends the post-classification change detection approach through object-based image analysis using optical imagery up to 30 m resolution for cyclone impact assessment and recovery. Spatial multi-criteria decision making approach using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is suggested for cyclone risk assessment. However, it is difficult to recommend how many risk assessment criteria should be processed as it depends on study context. The study suggests the geographic information system (GIS) based storm surge model to use as a basic input in the cyclone risk modelling process due to its simplicity. Digital elevation model (DEM) accuracy is a vital factor for risk assessment and modelling. The study recommends DEM spatial resolution up to 30 m, but higher spatial resolution DEMs always performs better.

A review with application to the Bohai Strait, China ]\n","977\n","[ Highlights We review the processes controlling the net flow through shallow straits. We examine the effects of tide, wind and long wave on the flushing of Bohai Sea. Far-field long wave originating in the East China Sea is important to Bohai Strait. The influence of river runoff (e.g. Yellow River) on the flushing is negligible. , We review the key processes controlling the net water circulation in shallow straits. The circulation is mainly barotropic, driven by the difference in mean sea level and tides on either side of the strait, the wind, the meandering of the currents in the adjoining seas, the bathymetry including the shape and width of the mouths and the presence of narrows, shoals, sills, islands, and lateral embayments. As the oceanography forcing can be non-synchronised on either side of the strait, the resulting net currents through the strait may appear chaotic. We apply these findings to the net circulation through the Bohai Strait in China using local wind, remote-sensing data of currents and sea level, and a hydrodynamic model. The net currents through the Bohai Strait were episodic. They were largest during winter storms when the wind generated a cyclonic coastal current in the northern Yellow Sea that flowed across the width of the Bohai Strait. Like the Luzon Strait, this current meandered and a branch of the current intruded into the northern Bohai Strait along the deeper channel. The wind set-up in the Bohai Sea and the wind-driven longshore current in the southern Bohai Sea generated a seaward flow through the southern Bohai Strait, somewhat like in Irbe Strait. As with the straits of the Seto Inland Sea , stagnation occurred in some embayments. As in the Torres Strait , the islands in the southern Bohai Strait retarded the net flow and increased the width of the outflow zone. These flows were also modulated at very long periods (∼60 days) by long waves in the Yellow Sea, possibly generated by meandering of the Kuroshio Current that created an additional sea level slope through the strait. The transit time in the Bohai Strait was 60 and 10 days, respectively, during calm weather and winter storms. The residence time in the Bohai Sea was estimated to be about 1.68 years by the LOICZ model and 1.56 years by the hydrodynamic model, and the influence of the river runoff, including the Yellow River, was negligible. ]\n","977\n","iteracion 978\n","[ Bycatch in gillnet fisheries – An overlooked threat to waterbird populations ]\n","978\n","[ Bird mortality in fishing gear is a global conservation issue and it is recognised that bycatch in industrial longline and trawl fisheries threatens several seabird species. Little is known however about the effects of bycatch in small-scale gillnet fisheries on bird populations. Here we review 30 studies reporting bird bycatch in coastal gillnet fisheries in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea region in order to assess the magnitude of this problem and potential effects on bird populations. All species of diving birds that occur in the study region, including divers (loons), grebes, sea ducks, diving ducks, auks and cormorants, have been reported as dying in fishing nets. The cumulative bycatch estimate extracted from several localized studies providing such information, suggests that about 90,000 birds die in fishing nets annually, a number that is almost certainly a substantial underestimate. We conclude that it is likely that between 100,000 and 200,000 waterbirds are killed per year. Geographic and temporal patterns of bycatch generally matched species distribution and periods of presence. Also, bycatch rates varied depending on species’ foraging technique and were influenced by net parameters and fishing depth. To evaluate effects of additive mortality on bird populations, we applied the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) concept to three species with the most extensive bycatch information. Agreeing with PBR assumptions we conclude that bycatch is a matter of concern for at least two of the three assessed species. We suggest that bycatch research in Europe and beyond should aim at unification of principles for bycatch assessment, setting new standards for the monitoring of waterbird populations so that vital rates and mortality data are recorded, and implementing quantifiable criteria for evaluating effects of fisheries bycatch. ]\n","978\n","iteracion 979\n","[ An updated review on tritium in the environment ]\n","979\n","[ Highlights Tritium exhibits numerous physico-chemical forms and complex behavior.

Rigs-to-Reefs converts decommissioned oil and gas platforms into artificial reefs. Reefing old oil and gas platforms is done globally where offshore production has been developed. Oil platforms off California are among the most productive marine fish habitats. California must decide whether to reef old platforms or removal them from coastal waters. , Consideration of whether to completely remove an oil and gas production platform from the seafloor or to leave the submerged jacket as a reef is an imminent decision for California, as a number of offshore platforms in both state and federal waters are in the early stages of decommissioning. Laws require that a platform at the end of its production life be totally removed unless the submerged jacket section continues as a reef under state sponsorship. Consideration of the eventual fate of the populations of fishes and invertebrates beneath platforms has led to global reefing of the jacket portion of platforms instead of removal at the time of decommissioning. The construction and use of artificial reefs are centuries old and global in nature using a great variety of materials. The history that led to the reefing option for platforms begins in the mid-20th century in an effort for general artificial reefs to provide both fishing opportunities and increase fisheries production for a burgeoning U.S. population. The trend toward reefing platforms at end of their lives followed after the oil and gas industry installed thousands of standing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico where they had become popular fishing destinations. The National Fishing Enhancement Act and subsequent National Artificial Reef Plan laid the foundation for Rig-to-Reefs. Reefing platforms in the Gulf of Mexico is a well-established practice that is also applied globally. Deliberation of reefing decommissioned platforms and many years of scientific study beneath California platforms has culminated in a California State law that now allows consideration of the concept.

It is hoped that this material will inform the public, policy makers, and regulators about their upcoming decisions. ]\n","980\n","iteracion 981\n","[ Evaluating the potential for exposure to organisms of public health concern in naturally occurring bathing waters in Europe: A scoping review. ]\n","981\n","[ Highlights Europe-wide analysis of organisms of public health concern in bathing waters.

Accordingly, this review sought to identify and synthesise all literature pertaining to a selection of bacterial (C ampylobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. , Shigella spp. , Vibrio spp. , Pseudomonas spp., AMR bacteria), viral (Hepatitis spp. , enteroviruses , rotavirus, adenovirus, norovirus), and protozoan ( Giardia spp., and Cryptosporidium spp.) contaminants in EU bathing waters.

A variety of water bodies were identified, with 27 investigations exclusively assessing coastal waters. Waterborne organisms were classified into three categories; bacteria, viruses, and protozoa; amounting to 58%, 36% and 17% of the total investigations, respectively. The total number of samples across all investigations was 8,118, with detection of one or more organisms in 2,449 (30%) of these.

In this review, we outline general principles regarding indicators of relative sea-level change in tidal wetlands and the conditions in which paleoseismic indicators must be distinct from those resulting from non-seismic processes. We present new evidence from sites across southcentral Alaska to illustrate different detection limits of paleoseismic indicators and consider alternative interpretations for marsh submergence and emergence. We compare predictions of coseismic uplift and subsidence derived from geophysical models of earthquakes with different rupture modes. The spatial patterns of agreement and misfits between model predictions and quantitative reconstructions of coseismic submergence and emergence suggest that no earthquake within the last 4000 years had a pattern of rupture the same as the Mw 9.2 Alaska earthquake in 1964. From the Alaska examples and research from other subduction zones we suggest that If we want to understand whether a megathrust ruptures in segments of variable length in different earthquakes, we need to be site-specific as to what sort of geological-based criteria eliminate the possibility of a particular rupture mode in different earthquakes. We conclude that coastal paleoseismological studies benefit from a methodological framework that employs rigorous evaluation of five essential criteria and a sixth which may be very robust but only occur at some sites: 1 – lateral extent of peat-mud or mud-peat couplets with sharp contacts; 2 – suddenness of submergence or emergence, and replicated within each site; 3 – amount of vertical motion, quantified with 95% error terms and replicated within each site; 4 – syncroneity of submergence and emergence based on statistical age modelling; 5 – spatial pattern of submergence and emergence; 6 – possible additional evidence, such as evidence of a tsunami or liquefaction concurrent with submergence or emergence.

The suitability of 23 finance mechanisms is reviewed for the GBR. Biodiversity valuation and finance solutions are linked. , The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a World-known, iconic environmental asset whose complex functioning is largely ascribed to its outstanding biodiversity, ranging from genes to plants, animals and entire ecosystems. Biodiversity has been key to its resilience over the past millennia. However, the combined effects of climate change, water quality degradation and coastal development are threatening the GBR’s resilience. There is a crucial need to better understand the value of biodiversity in that region to encourage sustainable policy-making. Different approaches have been suggested in the literature to value biodiversity. First, we review the use of a Total Economic Value framework to look into all dimensions of biodiversity values. Second, we describe an approach relying on ecosystem services. The suitability of these two approaches to value biodiversity in the GBR is assessed. Next, we review 23 finance mechanisms and discuss the possibility to use them to alleviate pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity in the GBR. We conclude by stressing the importance of biodiversity valuation in the GBR, highlight some of the remaining challenges and provide recommendations for future research avenues. ]\n","987\n","iteracion 988\n","[ Applying the ecosystem services concept to aquaculture: A review of approaches, definitions, and uses ]\n","988\n","[ Highlights Recent surge in academic interest to study ecosystem services in aquaculture systems. Study motivations include informing development, decision-making, and conservation. Immature research field and inconsistent use of ES concepts to study aquaculture. Poor coverage of aquaculture systems, ecosystem services and values, and approaches. Need for consistent and comparable ES measures under an aquaculture lens. , Recent years have witnessed growing interest in applying ecosystem service (ES) frameworks to promote holistic decision-making and develop sustainable aquaculture. The goal of this review was to analyze the status quo of research on aquaculture ES and identify knowledge gaps and research priorities to better align ES with holistic decision-making. This study conducted a systematic review of the academic literature and analyzed the coverage of aquaculture ES across 94 publications. The research field has evolved substantially in the last ten years, reaching a multidisciplinary audience around the world. While research coverage included all major production environments (coastal marine, brackishwater, and freshwater) and cultured species groups (finfish, bivalves, crustaceans, and seaweeds), emphasis is currently limited towards certain types of aquaculture and study areas (namely, brackishwater shrimp farming). This review found a flexible but inconsistent application of ES concepts and methods to support multiple decision-contexts including policy, development, and conservation. This paper proposes a research agenda to address research gaps, adopt more holistic ES-driven research, and apply consistent and comparable ES measures through an aquaculture lens. Ultimately, this should be supported by a shift in thinking that frames aquaculture as ‘aqua-ecosystems’, recognizing aquaculture as fundamentally embedded within linked social and ecological systems. ]\n","988\n","iteracion 989\n","[ Status of seagrass ecosystems in India ]\n","989\n","[ Highlights Ecology and distribution of seagrasses at different coastal areas is documented. Establishes the taxonomy and population genetics of India seagrasses. Provides a comprehensive document on seagrass research in the country. , India, one of the countries with prominent seagrass resources, is represented by 16 species of seagrass with an approximate cover of 500 sq km at isolated locations along the coast, lagoons , backwaters and estuaries . Molecular taxonomic studies confirmed the distribution of these species and further studies at the population level are warranted, as there are possibilities to erect 6 new species. Gulf of Mannar, Palk Bay, Andaman and Nicobar, Lakshadweep islands and Gulf of Kutch are the major seagrass areas characterized by unique ecological variation. Though there is no comprehensive study on the seagrass associated floral and faunal composition in the country, about 1250 species of flora and fauna including endangered dugong and green turtles are reported from this fragile ecosystem. Ecology, productivity and biomass of seagrass of the country are well documented at major seagrass sites leaving the other minor seagrass areas least studied. Mapping of seagrass in Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands and Tamilnadu coast are well documented but holistic mapping of seagrass in the entire country is still not attempted. The research on seagrass in India gained momentum in the recent past, but it still needs to go a long way to address the major research questions and transforming them as management plans. ]\n","989\n","iteracion 990\n","[ Atmospheric mercury in the Canadian Arctic. Part I: A review of recent field measurements ]\n","990\n","[ Highlights This paper reviews progress made in the study of the transport, transformation, deposition and reemission of atmospheric Hg in the Canadian Arctic, focusing on field measurements. Redox processes control the speciation of atmospheric Hg and bromine radicals are the primary oxidant of atmospheric Hg depletion in the spring It is expected that a smaller fraction of deposited Hg will be reemitted from coastal snowpacks. Atmospheric gaseous Hg concentrations have decreased in some parts of the Arctic but at a rate that was less than that at lower latitudes Remaining knowledge gaps are: the identification of oxidized Hg species in the air, total deposition amounts, physical-chemical processes over sea ice and impacts of Arctic climate change , Long-range atmospheric transport and deposition are important sources of mercury (Hg) to Arctic aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems . We review here recent progress made in the study of the transport, transformation, deposition and reemission of atmospheric Hg in the Canadian Arctic, focusing on field measurements (see Dastoor et al., this issue for a review of modeling studies on the same topics). Redox processes control the speciation of atmospheric Hg, and thus impart an important influence on Hg deposition, particularly during atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs). Bromine radicals were identified as the primary oxidant of atmospheric Hg during AMDEs. Since the start of monitoring at Alert (NU) in 1995, the timing of peak AMDE occurrence has shifted to earlier times in the spring (from May to April) in recent years, and while AMDE frequency and GEM concentrations are correlated with local meteorological conditions, the reasons for this timing-shift are not understood. Mercury is subject to various post-depositional processes in snowpacks and a large portion of deposited oxidized Hg can be reemitted following photoreduction ; how much Hg is deposited and reemitted depends on geographical location, meteorological, vegetative and sea-ice conditions, as well as snow chemistry. Halide anions in the snow can stabilize Hg, therefore it is expected that a smaller fraction of deposited Hg will be reemitted from coastal snowpacks. Atmospheric gaseous Hg concentrations have decreased in some parts of the Arctic (e.g., Alert) from 2000 to 2009 but at a rate that was less than that at lower latitudes. Despite numerous recent advances, a number of knowledge gaps remain, including uncertainties in the identification of oxidized Hg species in the air (and how this relates to dry vs. wet deposition), physical–chemical processes in air, snow and water—especially over sea ice—and the relationship between these processes and climate change. ]\n","990\n","iteracion 991\n","[ Terrestrial freshwater lenses: Unexplored subterranean oases ]\n","991\n","[ Highlights Terrestrial freshwater lenses (TFLs) are usually high-value freshwater resources. Recent discoveries suggest a higher TFL prevalence than previously thought. TFLs provide habitat refugia and water supply in often inhospitable conditions. The TFL typology presented here identifies more than six distinct types. This study is the first step towards improving global awareness of TFLs. , Freshwater lenses are lenticular bodies of fresh (TDS &lt; 1000 mg/L) groundwater that develop above more saline groundwater within the same host aquifer due in part to buoyancy. In contrast to the widely studied situation of freshwater lenses in coastal aquifers, the formation, location and persistence of freshwater lenses in terrestrial settings are poorly understood. This is despite inland aquifers commonly containing saline groundwater, particularly in arid and semi-arid climates, and the local occurrences of freshwater being critical for ecosystems and human endeavour. We identify and classify known terrestrial freshwater lenses (TFLs) using four formation categories, namely topography, geology, groundwater-surface water interaction and recharge mechanisms. The resulting typology highlights the importance of buoyancy in the formation of TFLs in otherwise unlikely situations, implying that TFLs may be more prevalent than previously thought. TFLs represent some of the most vulnerable and precious freshwater resources on Earth that require considerably more research into mechanisms of formation and threats to their existence. ]\n","991\n","iteracion 992\n","[ Morphodynamics of Holocene salt marshes: a review sketch from the Atlantic and Southern North Sea coasts of Europe ]\n","992\n","[ Salt marshes, most now embanked, together with genetically related wetlands and high intertidal flats, make a major environmental contribution to the lowland coasts of Northwest Europe. They occur in many different contexts, but chiefly on open and barrier coasts and in estuaries and embayments, and range greatly in scale, from a modest total that measure hundreds of square kilometres in individual extent, to an enormous number each of an area no greater than tens to a few hundred hectares. These marshes and associated environments are under complex natural controls and experienced from the mid-Holocene onward human exploitation and, increasingly, interference. The main external controls are the sea-level, tidal and sediment-supply regimes. Intrinsic infuences are provided by the halophytic vegetation and sediment autocompaction. Upward sea-level movements and autocompaction combine to provide accomodation space within which marshes build upward. Field data and simulation modelling show that youthful mineralogenic marshes grow up rapidly and can mature within a few hundred years of inception. They consist of a vegetated platform dissected typically by extensive networks of blind-ended, branching tidal creeks and gullies. The flow-resistant surface vegetation, shaping the combined wave-tide boundary layer on the platforms, both traps and binds tidally introduced mineral sediment, but also contributes an organic component of indigenous origin to the deposit. When sea-level becomes stable or falls, however, in response to century-millennial scale fluctuations, the organic sediment component becomes dominant and mineralogenic marshes are transformed into organogenic ones. Organogenic marshes normally display a considerable range of sub-environments which create much spatial variation in the peat facies which accumulate. At an advanced stage, domed raised bogs , rising significantly above the general landscape, may appear on the marshes. Because peat is such a porous and permeable sediment, and there is little or no tidal inundation, organogenic marshes in Northwest Europe typically lack surface channels for internal drainage. The stratigraphic sequences accumulated during the Holocene beneath coastal marshes and high tidal flats typically present an alternation on a vertical scale of decimetres to metres of silts (mineralogenic marshes, high intertidal mudflats) and peats (organogenic highest intertidal-supratidal marshes). Coastal barriers and some channels are represented by local accumulations of sand and/or gravel. The silts and peats form couplets which are generally considered to be related to fluctuations of sea-level about the general upward trend. Field investigations and modelling show that, in areas where marshes are mature, the upward change from an organogenic to a sequence of mineralogenic marshes (transgressive overlaps) is accompanied by the initiation and invasive development of a branching network of tidal creeks. These decay and infill during the reversal of the environmental sequence and the approach, expressed as a series of regressive overlaps, of the next set of peat-forming conditions. The operation of the continuous, progressive, irreversible and asymptotic process of sediment autocompaction exerts a major, secondary control on depositional regimes and marsh behaviour. A variety of local responses are consequently possible in an extensive marsh, even though the marsh may be everywhere in dynamic equilibrium with environmental factors. Autocompaction also strongly shapes the character of Holocene coastal sequences as now perceived, introducing significant stratigraphic distortions and displacements which, for the time being, limit the accuracy of sea-level curves and rates of sea-level change based on dated intercalated peats. Prehistoric humans benefitted from the resources of coastal salt marshes, especially at the times when peat marshes begin to be transgressed. Peat domes not yet fully collapsed may have provided vantage points for seasonal ocupancy or even settlement from which the richer resource of the mineralogenic marshes developing on lower ground could be exploited. Increasing human interference on salt marshes over the last millennium, chiefly through wholesale land-claim and set-back, augmented by rising sea levels and continuing autocompaction, has led to a variety of poorly understood but generally deleterious effects in the lowland coastal zone. These include major changes to tidal and sedimentary regimes. ]\n","992\n","iteracion 993\n","[ Suprasubduction zone model for metal endowment at 1.60–1.57 Ga in eastern Australia ]\n","993\n","[ A model that places development of IOCG (and porphyry-epithermal) mineralization at ca. 1.60–1.575 Ga in eastern Proterozoic Australia into the context of a modern-day suprasubduction zone is presented here. This model depicts a change from a rollback subduction geometry in which extensional basins were developing in the overriding plate from ca. 1.67–1.604 Ga to a flat-slab subduction environment where ca. 1.65–1.604 Ga arc-magmatism was shut off and hot, extensional basins were inverted under high-temperature/low-pressure metamorphic conditions. The change in subduction architecture was induced by the arrival of a buoyant oceanic plateau at the site of subduction at ca. 1.604 Ga. Subduction was associated with the development of F-rich, S-poor metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) as the result of slab melting within the rollback and/or the flat-slab subduction geodynamic setting. Eclogitisation and densification of the frontal oceanic slab resulted in slab steepening, a sudden upwelling of hot asthenosphere under the present-day Olympic Dam area and transient upper crustal uplift. The sudden heat input triggered slab melting and partial melting in the mantle to produce anhydrous, F-rich, S-poor melts that interacted with the metasomatized SCLM. Fractionation of resultant mafic melts with minimal to no crustal input resulted in generation of the dominantly A-type older Hiltaba Suite granites that were emplaced at upper crustal levels and an ignimbrite flare-up that is now recognised as the Gawler Range Volcanics. Highly fractionated magma that stalled in the upper crust exsolved volatile-rich and metalliferous fluids that mixed with meteoric and basinal brines to produce IOCG mineralization through the Olympic Domain including the supergiant Olympic Dam deposit. Further slab steepening and retreat of the posterior buoyant oceanic plateau resulting in additional upwelling of the asthenosphere and progressive development of an asthenospheric wedge in a normal subduction geometry. Slab retreat can be tracked by the progressive younging of Hiltaba Suite granites in a present-day approximately westerly to southwesterly direction. Heat introduced through progressive development of the asthenospheric wedge resulted in dehydration of the buoyant oceanic lithosphere to produce S-rich fluids that interacted with the asthenosphere to produce oxidised, S-rich partial melts. These melts interacted with the metasomatized SCLM resulting in generation of dominantly I-type magmas and porphyry-epithermal systems in the southwestern Gawler Craton (Central Gawler Gold Province). The location of IOCG and porphyry-epithermal deposits is also dictated by the location of lithospheric-scale structures that acted as conduits for fluids and melts associated with mineralization. The suprasubduction zone environment of mineralization is informed by modern analogues of the Late Cretaceous to Early Eocene Laramide Orogeny in the western United States, present-day slab geometries in the Andes of South America, and by the formation of Cretaceous IOCG and Cu-porphyry deposits in the Chilean Coastal Cordillera . ]\n","993\n","iteracion 994\n","[ Chapter 15 Persistent Organic Pollutants in Singapore's Marine Environment ]\n","994\n","[ Singapore is one of the busiest ports in the world and has many shipyards , petroleum refineries and pharmaceutical manufacturing plants are located on its coastline. Data on the prevalence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Singapore's coastal ecosystems are therefore important in order to support research on the potential threats to the local marine environment and human health. This chapter presents data on the prevalence of POPs in the seawater, sediments, biota and mangrove habitats of Singapore. Data are presented for a range of POPs including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine compounds (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Local studies confirm the ubiquity of POPs in the marine environment of Singapore. The prevailing ocean currents in the region govern the fate and transport of POPs in coastal waters, where the presence of localized high levels of POPs is likely to be a function of local shipping and industrial discharges . Land reclamation activities may also be a factor in the prevalence of POPs in seawater, where compounds are released from sediments and transported to the water column by seabed dredging. The land area under agricultural use in Singapore is negligible, and there is no direct application of OCPs in the country. However, pesticides may be easily transported through the atmosphere following volatilization from soil, and the presence of OCPs in Singapore's marine waters is likely to be a function of their use in neighbouring countries, with subsequent atmospheric transport and deposition . A biomagnification phenomenon was observed amongst the species collected and analysed from mangrove sites, but levels of POPs were not found to exceed relevant food safety standards. However, PCB concentrations in mangrove fish muscles were found to be higher than mean levels of PCBs found in seafood commonly consumed in Singapore. Overall, available data on the prevalence, fate and transfer of POPs in Singapore's marine environment highlights the ubiquity of these pollutants, and supports the need for a greater awareness on their fate, transport and bioaccumulation in local ecosystems. ]\n","994\n","iteracion 995\n","[ Life at the dry edge: Microorganisms of the Atacama Desert ]\n","995\n","[ The Atacama Desert, located in northern Chile, is the driest and oldest Desert on Earth.

The heterogeneity of the reservoirs related to depositional and diagenetic processes is illustrated. The heterogeneity results in a compartmentalization of the reservoirs at various scales. , High-frequency clastic shelf sequences contain porous deposits, consisting of coastal to shallow-water sandstones and conglomerates, which may represent very good reservoirs, and therefore critical targets for exploration and production, as well as for fluid (hydrocarbon, water or CO 2 ) storage. The study of these reservoirs, following a sequence stratigraphic approach, is essential to predict their features and distribution within systems tracts forming high-frequency sequences, which in turn compose higher-rank systems tracts and sequences. A critical aspect to improve the exploitability of the reservoirs is their heterogeneity, which directly affects the volume of the reservoirs and determine internal compartmentalization . The heterogeneity can be primary, related to depositional processes influencing grain size and facies distribution, and secondary, related to diagenesis . In particular, the primary heterogeneity is referred to the facies variability from distal to proximal settings, to the accumulation of condensed shell beds, and to facies characteristics of bedsets, whereas the secondary heterogeneity derives from diagenetic processes at sequence stratigraphic surfaces and facies contacts, and within sandbodies. Both the distribution of reservoirs and their heterogeneity can be predicted following a high-resolution sequence stratigraphic approach. Ultimately, the integration of subsurface data with the analysis of outcrop analogs is essential to better understand the features of clastic shelf reservoirs and to develop 3D models of fluid migration. ]\n","997\n","iteracion 998\n","[ Microbial methane emissions from the non-methanogenesis processes: A critical review ]\n","998\n","[ Highlights Methane production is not limited to methanogenic archaea. Methane production pathways by microorganisms under oxic conditions are discussed. Perspectives on its environmental significance and future perspective are presented. , Methane, a potent greenhouse gas of global importance, has traditionally been considered as an end product of microbial methanogenesis of organic matter. Paradoxically, growing evidence has shown that some microbes , such as cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, purple non-sulfur bacteria, and cryptogamic covers, produce methane in oxygen-saturated aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The non-methanogenesis process could be an important potential contributor to methane emissions. This systematic review summarizes the knowledge of microorganisms involved in the non-methanogenesis process and the possible mechanisms of methane formation. Cyanobacteria-derived methane production may be attributed to either demethylation of methyl phosphonates or linked to light-driven primary productivity, while algae produce methane by utilizing methylated sulfur compounds as possible carbon precursors. In addition, fungi produce methane by utilizing methionine as a possible carbon precursor, and purple non‐sulfur bacteria reduce carbon dioxide to methane by nitrogenase. The microbial methane distribution from the non-methanogenesis processes in aquatic and terrestrial environments and its environmental significance to global methane emissions, possible mechanisms of methane production in each open water, water-to-air methane fluxes, and the impact of climate change on microorganisms are also discussed. Finally, future perspectives are highlighted, such as establishing more in-situ experiments, quantifying methane flux through optimizing empirical models, distinguishing individual methane sources, and investigating nitrogenase-like enzyme systems to improve our understanding of microbial methane emission from the non-methanogenesis process. ]\n","998\n","iteracion 999\n","[ The North American hydrologic cycle through the last deglaciation ]\n","999\n","[ While the climate evolution of North America during the last deglaciation has received considerable attention, few detailed model–data comparisons of the deglacial hydroclimate have been conducted at the continental scale. Here we use a transient climate simulation of the last deglaciation and a synthesis of hydroclimate proxies from across the continent to broadly assess the moisture budget and its evolution, including the primary components and mechanisms for changes, and evaluate the level of agreement between model and data in order to inform areas of major discrepancy for attention in future work. At the broadest scale, the simulation indicates that North America was wetter than modern through much of the last deglaciation, with the exception of the Pacific Northwest. This was principally due to increased moisture convergence by the mean flow over the west of the continent, and by transient eddies over the east. We find that the simulation demonstrates considerable skill in comparison to proxy records in the coastal Southwest and Pacific Northwest, with limited success in other regions. The highest disagreement occurs in the North-central region, where the model and data disagree on the sign of changes. In addition, we find that the areas of agreement coincide with regions whose hydroclimate is dominated by winter precipitation, while regions of disagreement are those where summer precipitation is predominant, and where the model suggests dynamical changes are important. These results illustrate the impact of the ice sheet on the atmospheric dynamics , and therefore the importance of its accurate reconstruction, as well as that of model resolution. Our analysis and synthesis provide context for future transient climate simulations, and suggest numerous areas of priority for future research. ]\n","999\n","iteracion 1000\n","[ Marine protected area networks in the Philippines: Trends and challenges for establishment and governance ]\n","1000\n","[ Marine protected areas (MPAs) are the most extensively implemented fisheries management and conservation tool in the Philippines.

However, the contribution of these MPAs to ecologically connected networks of MPAs is variable since most MPAs were not designed to be parts of networks. Nevertheless, there is growing support for the development of MPAs within the national integrated coastal management framework which supports the “scaling up” of MPAs to establish networks.

Discusión\n","---\n","\n","Analizando los datos representados con el **Mapa de Distancia Intertrópicos** es posible definir tres grandes grupos de tópicos. Dichos grupos representarían los temas más relevantes dentro de la oceanografía de costas.\n","\n","En primer lugar, se observa un clúster de tópicos en la región derecha del diagrama, como se detalló antes, presenta palabras relacionadas con temas ecológicos y ambientales. Dentro de este clúster, se presentan los tópicos más relevantes para el *corpus*, es decir, los tópicos más importantes dentro de los procesos costeros (cambio climático y contaminación). Sin embargo, ambos tópicos se solapan completamente, por lo que sería posible hablar solo de un tópico (cambio climático), dado que la contaminación hace parte del mismo.\n","\n","En segundo lugar, en el costado superior derecho se observa un clúster con tópicos muy relacionados entre sí, como: carbono, energías renovables, carbono azul y tsunamis. Por lo que es posible que dicho clúster se relacione con procesos físicos, aplicados a las necesidades económicas y a la gestión del riesgo global.\n","\n","Finalmente, se observa un tópico muy alejado del resto, este presenta mayormente palabras relacionadas con procesos geodinámicos y tectónicos. Adicionalmente, respecto al tamaño del mismo, este tópico no parece ser de los más relevantes.\n","\n","Respecto al apartado de evaluación del modelo, se encuentra que uno de los puntos de inflexión de la curva se posiciona en 10 tópicos. Sin embargo, la diferencia en entre elegir 9, 10 u 11 tópicos, no provoca grandes cambios en el modelo."],"metadata":{"id":"kYv_hAkDv7_e"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 8.
